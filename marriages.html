<p><font size=+1><b>M</b>arriage marked the passage of
young people into adulthood. As the new couple settled into a <a href="homes.html">city
home</a> and began to raise a <a href="children.html">family</a>, young Albanians were identified as substantial citizens - worthy of full participation in the life of the community.
Because most Albany adults were married, we might say that marriage represented
a preferred or ideal status. However, not all the city's sons and
daughters would find a mate and prosper - at least not in the Albany setting.

<p>Little was said about finding a marriage partner in the community's 
  literary record. <a href="bios/s/elsstaats99.html#portrait"><img SRC="images/jpg/jandeschuyler.jpg" ALT="Johannes and Elsie Staats Wendell Schuyler" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4 border=1 width=280 height=180 align=LEFT></a>
  However, for the six or more generations prior to the nineteenth century, the 
  <a href="whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a> has 
  developed some perspective on early Albany marriages as a result of assembling 
  and analyzing a large body of marriage <a href="cbr.html">materials</a> - namely church, bible, probate 
  records, and other legal documents. The city marriage mosaic also enables us 
  to appreciate the important role Albany marriages played in the evolving settler 
  society of the greater <a href="albanycounty.html">Hudson-Mohawk region</a>.</p>
 
<p><We might begin by looking at who married whom and what happened to them. Marriage represented
a new beginning for the partners as most newlyweds raised their families
in home - separate from parents. Large nuclear small size of city homes worked against extended family living.
Clearly, marriages were arranged. They seemed serve family-based
ends. Yet, it is unclear controlled matchmaking. number sometimes complicated protocols established, altered, amended. Arranged helped ensure prosperity,
community stability, survival Albany's distinctive culture
more hundred years.></p>

<p>From the earliest days, sons and daughters of Albany's more prosperous families married each other, the children of wealthy outsiders, and also promising but undistinguished
&eacute;migr&eacute;s. For example, <a href="bios/s/schuyler.html">Schuylers</a> married <a href="bios/vr/vr.html">Van Rensselaers</a> 
and <a href="bios/w/wendell.html">Wendells</a>, Van Cortlandts from downriver, and talented newcomers including
<a href="bios/l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a> and Alexander Hamilton. Thus, budding fortunes
were preserved and often enhanced through marriage. Similarly, middling
and marginal people married within their means - although the variations
were much more diverse.</p>

<p>Marriages occurred across cultural lines - the most obvious involving daughters of Albany's founders - the New Netherland Dutch, with English and Irish soldiers, <a href="bios/irish.html">Sc</a>ottish traders, and opportunists from <a href="yankinv.html">New England</a> and the other North American colonies.
A few of the <a href="newcomers.html">newcomers</a> including Captain <a href="bios/h/hholland8489.html">Henry Holland</a> brought wives with them. But most of those who came after the New Netherland period were single,
young men - numbering more than a thousand before 1800. In contrast, fewer than fifty single, young women settled in Albany during that period.<a name=daughters></a></p>

<p>Most of the newcomers who stayed in Albany were married within a few years of their arrival. For <a href="garrison.html">soldiers</a>, traders, and other young men, marriage to the daughter of an established city family was an important step toward achieving acceptance and success
within the Albany framework. Virtually all of the successful &eacute;migr&eacute;s
before the American Revolution married a daughter of an established although
sometimes struggling early Albany family. The five daughters of middling
carpenter <a href="bios/vv/javvlk1306.html">Jacob Van Valkenburgh</a> and <a href="bios/r/mgtradcliff1080.html">Margarita Radcliff</a>, who married newcomers
<a href="bios/l/thlynott1147.html">Thomas Lynott</a>, <a href="bios/v/jovernor8413.html">John Vernor</a>, <a href="bios/t/jotayler.html">John Tayler</a>, <a href="bios/d/hdenniston5136.html">Hugh Denniston</a>, and <a href="bios/b/jabgd7354.html">James Bloodgood</a> during the third quarter of the eighteenth-century, provide an outstanding
but not isolated example.<a name=sons></a></p>

<p>While such unions almost always benefited both static and successful Albany   families, the internal social consequences were enormous as literally hundreds of city sons were left to find a mate from outside of Albany. Typically, a native son's relocation from the city followed his marriage to a non-native woman. The story of sheriff turned lawyer/civil servant <a href="bios/y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> bringing the <a href="bios/d/andridder5696.html">daughter</a> of a successful Schaghticoke farmer to   his Market Street home was a less common scenario. With so many sons of Albany   finding their futures in surrounding <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, an outlying community, or on the frontier, the names of many of Albany's earliest families disappeared from city rolls. Although masked in a patriarch-based public record, those families remained an important part of the community as native stock embodied in the daughters of New Netherland represented a important element of virtually every old and new early city family.<a name=age></a></p>

<p><a name=young></a>Early Albany marriage partners were younger than in most colonial communities. Most partners were within a year or two in age. Typically, men married at age twenty-one or
twenty-two with their wives a year or two younger. <a href="bios/vb/cavbrugh8628.html"><img src="images/jpg/cavbrugh150.jpg" align=right width=150 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Catharina Van Brugh Livingston"></a>Teenaged marriage
partners were uncommon - most often occurring in the case of an expectant
bride. First marriages involving mates over the age of thirty also
were infrequent - and may be tied to the groom's days in the military,
at sea, or on the frontier. Surviving partners often remarried after
the loss of a spouse - particularly during the first two decades of the
marriage. Middle-aged widowers remarried but post-childbearing widows typically
did not. In the case of widows, husband's conditional bequests of
property as long as wives did not remarry may have deterred re-marriage.
Few older survivors remarried - either continuing to reside in their home
or moving in with children or other kin. Some widowed and single
people were able to live quite long lives. More than a hundred early
Albany residents survived past 80 and as many as fifty community people
lasted past their ninetieth birthdays. The notion of early Americans
having an average life expectancy of less than fifty years is skewed downward
by a high infant and child mortality rate. Many early Albany people
lived through their golden years and <a href="bios/d/jodp.html">beyond</a>.</p>

The demographic
success of a marriage embodied in a large number of surviving <a href="children.html">children</a>
represented another key life attribute. The <i>Colonial Albany Project</i>
attaches great significance to the marriages of community people.
Marriage patterns and subsequent family histories are an integral part
of our ongoing inquiry and provide a critical perspective on the lives
of the people of colonial Albany and their world.</p>
