<td><font face="cg omega, arial">Fully half the people living in the colonial
city of Albany were female. Girls, wives, widows, and spinsters, they bore
babies, raised families, kept the home, and even found the time and energy
to take part in the activities of the outside world. Long overlooked by
historians, their lives have been documented by the research of the <i><a href="../whoarewe.html">Colonial
Albany Social History Project</a></i>, a model community history program
at the New York State Museum.</font>
<p><font face="cg omega, arial">This illustrated presentation and discussion
looks closely at the lives of a dozen individuals to show how early Albany's
mothers and daughters sustained the social fabric and framework for one
of the oldest cities in the United States. During Women's History Month,
this program provides an opportunity for mothers, grandmothers, daughters,
aunts, nieces, and sisters to appreciate and reflect on the lives of women
then and today.</font>
