    <TD><FONT size=+2>O</FONT size>n Thursday evening, more than 200 people 
      braved a cold and snowy night to <IMG align=right 
      alt="Hackett Middle School marquee" border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4  
      src="../images/plhackett.jpg" width=230>take part in a 
      delightful program at beautiful old Hackett Middle School on Delaware 
      Avenue.
    
      <P>The evening began with the reading of a proclamtion from the Albany County 
        Legislature designating that day, February 3, 2000, as "The Promised Land 
        Day" in Albany County. Host <a href="../bios/staff/sbbio.html">Stefan 
        Bielinski</a> began by thanking county legislature president Frank J. 
        Commisso for the eloquent recognition of "The Promised Land" story and 
        of its importance in Albany's history and then presented the proclamation 
        to Rapp Road chairperson Emma Woodard Dickson. 
     
      <P>Bielinski presented an overview of the <A 
      href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/african/afam008.html">"Great Migration"</A> 
        of the descendants of slaves from the rural South to Northern cities like 
        Albany during the first part of the 20th century, described <A href="../loc/rapproad.html">Rapp 
        Road today</A> - its location, boundaries, and proximity to other local 
        landmarks, and then introduced Emma Dickson. 
     
      <P>As the audience settled in, the program unfolded with the speaker 
      addressing Bielinski's queries covering topics including Shubuta, 
      Mississippi, the exodus and trips to Albany, the South End, the Church of 
      God in Christ, settling Rapp Road,<IMG align=right 
      alt="Rapp Road - August 22, 1955" border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 
      src="../images/plbertha.jpg" width=300> life there from the 
      1940s to the present, and her hopes for the future. Frequent digressions 
      from the planned "march of time" provided fascinating insights into the 
      rich social fabric of the Promised Land story.</P>

      <P>Then, the large and enthusiastic audience - particularly those with personal 
        ties to Rapp Road, asked additional questions, offered corroborating and 
        new information, and raised a number of issues that were considered and 
        discussed. Unlike most history event audiences, this gathering included 
        many children who came with parents and grandparents - Rapp Road descendants 
        and Hackett PTA members alike! Also well represented were the members 
        of the co-sponsoring institutions including the Friends of Schuyler Mansion, 
        Albany Institute of History and Art, and Ten Broeck Mansion (Albany County 
        Historical Association) - all of which helped promote the event through 
        their regular and special avenues. A number of neighborhood and community 
        organizations created links to the <A 
      href="pl.html">electronic program flyer</A> on their websites.</P>

      <P>Judging from the audience and the number of phone calls received, the 
        feature article in the Albany <A href="../newsarticles/grondahl020300.html">Times 
        Union</A> provided widespread visibility. Additionally, several local 
        organizations included promotional flyers in their regular mailings. However, 
        we believe that the success of the event was due largely to an extensive 
        personal promotional campaign on the part of individual members of the 
        sponsoring groups. It is fitting that a story that has been passed down 
        chiefly in oral tradition relied on good old "word of mouth" to be its 
        messenger in the year 2000!</P>

      <P>Staff at the <I><A href="../whoarewe.html">Colonial Albany Social History 
        Project</A></I> took the lead in organizing this particular event as part 
        of its ongoing <A 
      href="../specialeffort.html">Black History Month committment</A>, as an 
        example of how to bring Albany's history organizations together in a cooperative 
        and successful community-based program, and in order to begin to shed 
        light on a neglected aspect of Albany's history. Images uncovered and 
        digitized for the program can become the core of a Promised Land archive 
        and a <A 
      href="pltimeline.html">time line</A> created to help organize program discussion 
        can only be expanded and improved.</P>

      <P>Although well beyond its defined parameters of concern,<I>The Colonial 
        Albany Project</I> will continue to accept information and copies of materials 
        relating to the Promised Land story. Soon, this website will include a 
        feature on the western section of early Albany - that is the mile-wide 
        expanse of land from Lark Street to Albany's original western <a href="../citylimits.html">boundary</a> 
        - sixteen miles northwest of the Hudson River. During the 18th century, 
        a few people lived in that part of the city along the legendary "<a href="../loc/kingshighway.html">King's 
        Highway</a>" to Schenectady.</P>
