<p><b>T</b>he Internet is the principal and preferred educational tool employed by <i>the Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> to present its history of family and community in pre-industrial America to diverse audiences today.

<p>Launched in 1999, the <i>People of Colonial Albany Live Here <a href="../index.html">Website</a></i> now features more than 3,500 separate yet interactive items including biographical profiles, places of interest, important events and themes, documents, maps, and information on the ways project historians have created a unique and broadly accessible resource focused on one of the oldest early American communities.

<p>Presentations typically begin with "Meet the People of Colonial Albany," a visual and musical <a href="mpca.html">introduction</a> to and overview of the essential themes and resources in the story of the <a href="../criteria.html">people</a> of colonial Albany and their world. 

<p>Hosted by project founder, community historian, and webmaster <a href="../bios/staff/sbbio.html">Stefan Bielinski</a>, this offering is intended to be an interactive seminar showcasing the overall web exposition while demonstrating its varied facets and features. Discussion is an integral part of the program.

<p>Like virtually every part of the project itself, this program is <a href="../inprog.html">in-development</a> and is constantly changing as we move forward or at least more deeply into the past!</p>
