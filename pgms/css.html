<p><align=left><a href="../bios/s/sschuyler8492.html"><font size=+2><b>S</b></font size><font size=+1>amuel Schuyler</font></a><font size=+1> (1781-1842) went from dock worker to towboat operator to successful businessman and entrepreneur. He was the patriarch of a large early Albany family. This remarkable but little-known pioneer also was of <a href="../afroalbanians.html">African ancestry</a>.</font></p><font size=+1>
 
<p>The story of Captain Samuel Schuyler is also the story of the initial settlement of Albany's <a href="../loc/southend.html">South End</a> in the years following the American Revolution. This illustrated, general audience program focuses on the role of Afro Albanians in the establishment of the city's first and oldest residential neighborhood. It encourages those in the audience to become involved in an exploration of the community's history. It can be supplemented by an <a href="../art/art-jls.html">online article</a> on the emergence of Albany's Afro-American middle class.</p>

 <p>This program is presented by <a href="../bios/staff/sbbio.html">Stefan Bielinski</a> of the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> in support of  the <b>Captain Samuel Schuyler Historical Project</b> - a grass  roots initiative  that   commissioned a painting by  noted historical artist <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/shop/19th-Century/Portrait-of-America/prod_76.html">Len  Tantillo</a> of Samuel Schuyler and his boat set against the backdrop of nineteenth century Albany. At one time, the original painting  was to be donated   to the <i>John Howe Memorial Library</i> located on Schuyler Street  in the heart of the old <a href="../loc/southend.html">South End</a>. However, the current status of that initiative, the Schuyler project, and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/John-A-Howe-Branch-of-Albany-Public-Library/119153838124847">Howe Library</a> itself is less certain.
