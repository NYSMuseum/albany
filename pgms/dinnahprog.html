        <p><b>T</b>he early 1800s marked the emergence of free Black families in 
          the booming capital city of Albany. Until her death in 1818, <a href="../bios/j/djackson1074.html">Dinnah 
          Jackson</a> was the community's most prominent Afro Albanian matriarch. 
          Thirty years earlier, she became Albany's first African ancestry property 
          holder when she purchased a lot on <a href="../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor 
          Hill</a>. While raising a large family, she managed to save enough money 
          to purchase additional parcels in her north Albany neighborhood. She 
          was one of a number of African ancestry householders who made up almost 
          one-fifth of the city's <a href="../population.html">population</a> 
          by 1820.</p>

<p>However, the story of <a href="../afroalbanians.html">African American life</a> in Albany began with the founding of the community many years before. It is best understood within a larger community context. This musical, visual, and interactive overview of early Albany history focuses on the world of Dinnah Jackson and is based on research conducted by the <a href="../whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a>.</p>

      <p>Presentation of the most outstanding images of early Albany and its people 
        provides an orientation to social and economic issues relating to our 
        community's formative years. It is accompanied by the musical theme <a href="../art/art-rr.html">Albany 
        - a Song of Community</a> as recorded by the fantasy group "Duke and the 
        Beverets." Images and issues provide a springboard for questions and discussion.</p>
