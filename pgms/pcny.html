<p><font face="arial">From the
beginning, New York was a place where many different peoples or minorities
came together to make up a colonial majority. A great mix of people
made early New York society both culturally diverse and pluralistic.
This general audience program explains the initial settlement of what became
New York State by bringing together the experiences of the heterogeneous
groups of people who came to the colony before 1776.</font>

<p><font face="arial">Focusing
on New York's economic and cultural diversity and on the adaptability and
opportunism of its people, this illustrated lecture considers the formation
and evolution of a pre-industrial economy while assessing the ecological
impact of the peopling process. This presentation provides a basic
social history of early New York set against the backdrop of traditional,
narrative history. Major historical topics to be covered include
the setting for the settling, Native peoples, the birth pyramid, the founding
and growth of communities and other social networks, intercultural relations,
the modification of traditional practices and institutions to meet New
World needs, and a summary discussion of why some colonial New Yorkers
would become revolutionaries while others did not.</font>

<p><font face="arial">Peopling
Colonial New York" is illustrated by more than eighty images from the <i>Colonial
Albany Social History Project</i>'s Graphics Archive and is supplemented
by a reading list and other materials. Presentation time is under
an hour and questions are always welcome.</font></font><font face="arial"><font </font>
