<ul>
<li>
This story begins with a group of struggling farmers from Shubuta, Mississippi
who were brought by an Albany minister to the South End of Albany during
the 1930s.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
These country people found work in the city's service industries. With
the help of their church, several families purchased land in the Pine Barrens
on the western edge of Albany.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Over several generations, these families established a neighborhood along
Rapp Road, became an important part of Albany's African American community,
and today remain stalwart members of Albany's Wilborn Temple.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Their story is an important but little known chapter in Albany's rich and
varied history.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Emma Dickson</b> is the daughter of an original Rapp Road family and
the proprietor of a Childcare center operating there today. She is a fascinating
and articulate spokesperson for their story.
<b>Stefan Bielinski</b> is
the author of numerous works on the history of Albany.</li>
