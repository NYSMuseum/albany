            <p><img SRC="../images/jpg/th/abrahamyatesth.jpg" ALT="Abraham Yates, Jr." HSPACE=4 VSPACE=2 BORDER=1 height=64 width=50 align=left>The 
              summer of 2000 marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the publication 
              of <i>Abraham Yates, Jr. and the New Political Order in Revolutionary 
              New York</i> by a then-young historian named <a href="../bios/staff/sbbio.html">Stefan 
              Bielinski</a>. That defining study of an Albany boy who rose from 
              the working class to lead the crusade for liberties in upstate New 
              York, devote a long career to public service, and then be remembered 
              as one of the major political writers of the post-Revolutionary 
              era was also the inspiration for the establishment of the <a href="../whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial 
              Albany Social History Project</i></a> in 1981.</p>

<p>Because Yates's life was intimately connected with the evolution of an important early American city, the struggle with the British that produced a new state and nation, and the emergence of a major American boom-town during the 1780s and 90s, in many ways his story is Albany's story as well.</p>

<p>This summer, the <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> will present a number of programs that celebrate the life of this important and interesting early Albanian. At present, these programs include:</p>
<center>
              New <a href="../bios/y/ayjr.html">web-based resources</a> on the life 
              of Abraham Yates, Jr.
