            <b>O</b>n Tuesday, May 21, 2002, <b>Christine S. Patrick</b> will 
            present a public program entitled <b>"Washington and Schuyler: The 
            Father of Our Country Visits Albany."</b> Dr. Patrick currently is 
            assistant editor of <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/gwpapers/">The 
            Papers of George Washington</a> at the University of Virginia and 
            is an expert on the American Revolution. 
          <p>Her appearance in Albany comes as the featured address at the annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.schuylerfriends.org/">Friends of Schuyler Mansion</a> State Historic Site. The lecture will be held in the great hall of the Mansion at 7:00 pm. Light refreshments will be served!</p>

<p>A native of Cobleskill whose ancestors were among the earliest settlers of the area, Christine Sternberg Patrick earned a doctorate in history at the University of Buffalo where she produced a doctoral dissertation on Samuel Kirkland - a Presbyterian missionary among the Oneidas and a contemporary of both Generals Schuyler and Washington. She has taught history at Niagara University, the University of Georgia, and at James Madison University.</p>

<p>Her appearance in Albany is sponsored by the Friends of Schuyler Mansion - a chartered educational organization that furthers the restoration, interpretation, and public awareness of the eighteenth-century home of General Philip Schuyler. The Friends sponsor an annual meeting each Spring to attract new members.</p>

<p>While in Albany, Professor Patrick also will hold an informal seminar for staff and friends of the <a href="../index.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i>.</a> </p>
