<p>A "cardboad mount" for this watercolor in the <a href="../res/fairuse.html">collection</a> of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/paint_sculpt.htm">Albany Institute of History and Art</a> was labelled "North Pearl Street – from Steuben Street South – as it was in 1812 – from original sketches by James Eights." Described and presented in  <a href="../books.html#aiha"><i>200 Years of Collecting</i></a>, pp. 58-59.

<p>The following explanation appeared in a section entitled "Albany Fifty Years Ago" printed in Munsell's <a href="../sources.html#mc"><i>Collections</i></a>, II, pp. 21-22. Listed as "No. VIII" it has been transformed here for accessibility:

<p><blockquote><blockquote>No. VIII is a continuation of No. VII, showing a portion of North 
Pearl street. This section will appear familiar to some of my Albany 
friends who were boys fifty years ago, for they will recognize in 15 the 
little district school-house and its surroundings, where they went to get 
whipped, and to be seated upon a hard high bench six or seven hours 
each day. The first house in this sketch (10) was the dwelling of Dr. 
William M'CIellan, an eminent Scotch physician.- In the next (11) broad 
and spacious house dwelt the very distinguished John B. Romeyn, D.D., 
of the Presbyterian Church. Dr. llomeyn was quite remarkable for his 
obesity.-J An anecdote connected with him is related, which exhibits the 
often lurking humor of the grave and taciturn Indian. One very hot 
day in July, during the administration of Governor Jay, the doctor was 
present just at the conclusion of a council with Mohawk and Oneida 
Indians, at Schenectady. The Indians have a custom of adopting white 
people of eminence into their tribes, and giving them significant names, 
and the honorary title of chief. At the Doctor's urgent solicitation he 
was adopted by the Oneidas. The day was excessively sultry, and he sat 
there perspiring at every pore. When the ceremony was ended, he in- 
quired what was his new name. With great gravity the old sachem gave 
it in the Iroquois language, while not a muscle of the face of his dusky 
companions was moved. The Doctor wished an interpretation, and the 
sachem, with equal gravity replied, The Great Thaw. The Indians 
sat unmoved, while the whole white portion of the audience roared with 
laughter. 

<p>1 This person, it is claimed, was Cornelius Brower, some time baker, and 
afterwards a sort of cartman, but never a sexton at all. 

<p>2 This was many years previous the house and store of Henry Bleecker, an 
Indian trader, the store occupying the room with a single window. Customers 
entered the hall, and made their purchases at an aperture in the partition. The 
shop was opened by swinging a door up and fastening it against the ceiling. 
Business was done in an unostentatious way in those days — no thrusting of goods 
out on the side walk, no opening the whole front to the street. The entrance to 
some places of business is said to have been through an alley at the side of the 
house. Mr. Bleecker was badly wounded by an Indian while on a trading expe- 
dition up the Mohawk, which, although he lived some years after, hastened his 
death. 

<p>
3 The reminiscent seems to have made a great mistake here. This house was 
built and owned by John Nicholas Bleecker, who had been a commissary in 
either the French or Revolutionary war. Dr. Romeyn married a daughter of Mr. 
Bleecker, and resided in tlie house a very short time. So far from being obese, 
he was a i;pnrem.-An. Tlie anecdote must relate to his father, who is represented 
to have been a portly man, of a very fine presence, but hardly answering to the 
description here given. 

<p>
Next to Dr. Romeyn's stood a house of more ancient pattern (12) in 
which resided Nicholas Bleecker, one of the wealthiest merchants of the 
city. <a href="../bios/e/peelmen.html">Peter Elmendorf</a>, an eminent lawyer, dwelt in the adjoining house 
(14) ;i and between that and the little school house (15) was the play- 
ground for the boys. Looking over that inclosure, and among the trees, 
IS seen the top of the old family mansion or homestead of the Bleeckers, 
at the corner of Chapel and Steuben streets. There Harmanus Bleecker, 
our minister at the Hague a few years ago, resided at the time of his 
death. I believe the property has since passed out the possession of the 
family. I remember seeing there, during the latter years of the late Mr. 
Bleecker, a fine portrait, cabinet size, of John Randolph of Roanoke, 
painted by Ward of Philadelphia. Bleecker and Randolph were warm 
friends while they were in Congress together in 1811 ; and, as a token of 
that friendship, they exchanged portraits with each other. 

<p>
The last house (16) was the residence of John Andrews, a well known 
police constable, who was the terror of evil-doers in the good old Dutch 
city fifty ye:\rs ago. He might always be seen at the polls on election 
days, with a stout leather cap, similar to those worn by firemen, and an 
ugly looking hickory cudgel with two huge knobs on the larger end. 

<p>No. IX not hsown

<p>
note: 
' Peter E. Elmendorf lived in the house No. 12, attributed to Nicholas Bleecker, 
and in the next house resided Gerardus Lansing, brother-in-law of Gen. Ten 
Broeck, and formerly an Indian interpreter. A house has been omitted which 
stood next to No. 13, built and occupied by Jolin Rutger Bleecker, a surveyor. 
These discrepancies are not much to be wondered at, when we consider what 
disputes sometimes arise where property is accurately described. No. 12 was the last 
of the old houses in that row, and wns taken down but a few years ago. The site is 
now occupied by the free stone front dwelling of William S. Learned, Esq. This lot 
is said to have belonged originally to Maria Sanders, daughter of Robert Sanders 
and wife of Philip Van Rensselaer. It descended to her daughter Betsey, the 
first wife of Peter E. Ehnendorf. From Mrs. Elmendorf it descended to her 
daughter Maria, wife of Peter Sanders, still living; and was conveyed by her to 
William White, and by him to the present owner. In this house Burgoyne was 
entertained at a large dinner party while he was in Albany, by Mr. Philip Van 
Rensselaer. Peter E. Elmendorf afterwards lived in a house nearly opposite to 
this lot, where stands the house built by Mr. Thomas W. Olcott, at present owned 
by Azariah E. Stimson.
