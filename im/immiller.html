<p><a name=miller></a><b>John Miller:</b> First see, our online <a href="../bios/m/jmiller.html">biography</a> 
  and excerpts from his <a href="../art/miller.html">narrative</a>! Because, it 
  appeared so often in publications during the nineteenth century, the map shown 
  here (copied from an office edition of <i>New York Considered and Improved . 
  . .</i>) still is among the <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=miller+map+albany+1695">most 
  frequently used</a> cartographic representations of the layout of early Albany. 
  The best engraved image (even though it omits the development north of the stockade) 
  we have found is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Albany_plan_1695.png">available</a> 
  via Wikapedia An <a href="http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchdetail.cfm?strucID=253196#">online 
  offering</a> from the New York Public Library is particularly noteworthy and 
  user-friendly. However, the most "picturesque" version is a <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/john-miller-plan-of-albany-in-1695.html">color 
  print</a> in the collection of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany 
  Institute of History and Art</a>.

<p>Compare this representation with the engineer's <a href="imroemer.html">map</a> made by John Wolfgang Roemer dated just a few years later.

<blockquote>
    <p><b>N</b>ow more than fifty years ago, the first representation of Albany 
      I encountered was an engraving of the "Miller Map" as it appeared in <a href="../books.html#we">Weise's 
      history</a> of the city - which I "found" in the Albany Room at the old 
      Public Library on Dove Street. It has always intrigued me for the questions 
      it raised about the colonial city and its people - particularly about the 
      artistic renderings of houselots. For a number of years I thought lightly 
      of it as this and other common representations of it clearly had been "<a href="../victorian.html">victorianized</a>." 
      However, by the 1980s, more experience and particularly the counsel of <a href="../tantillo.html">Len 
      Tantillo</a> first gave me new respect for this "first" serious depiction. 
      When correlated with the earliest <a href="../census1697.html">census</a> 
      of the city's households taken in 1697 and other surrounding <a href="../guide/histres.html#cs">survey 
      documents</a>, we first were able to study the city and its people in a 
      more systematic and/or comprehensive way.</P>
