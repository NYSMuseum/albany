<p>This copy of a diagram by an unknown cartographer reflects the layout of <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a> during the early 1800s and was printed in Munsell's <i><a href="../sources.html#mc">Collections</a> on the History of Albany</i>, 3:458. We believe it to be one of the earliest attempts to plot out inhabitation along this one-time path to the pastures!
 
<p>However, Albany residents began to build along this "cow path" from the beginning of the eighteenth century. Running east from the future South Pearl Street was a section later called <a href="../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> or "Cheapside" that was settled by former garrison soldiers and other <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> whose homes are shown on an <a href="../lists/list1709tl.html#ss">assessment roll</a> from the early 1700s. The <a href="../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>, dating to the late 1600s, and later the <a href="../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> meeting house were built along this street.

<p>By the 1750s, an enclave of <a href="../trades/weaver.html">weavers</a> 
        and a number of other Albany mainliners <a href="../census1756.html#176">lived</a> 
        along the street. 
      <p>Before 1814, this road was known as "Washington Street" commemorating 
        a walk General George Washington reputedly took from State Street to <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler 
        Mansion</a> when he visited Albany in 1783.</p>
      <p>The block west of South Pearl and between Plain and Hamilton Streets 
        was "Hallenbeck-intensive" containing the homes of several of Hendrick 
        Hallenbeck's children. 
      <p>The "<a href="../loc/hallbg.html">Halenbeek Burial Ground</a>," located 
        south of South Pearl and Hamilton Street, was established in the will 
        of <a href="../bios/h/hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick Hallenbeck</a> in 
        1764 and served as a family plot until it was dismantled in 1860.</p>

      The southern continuation of this drawing (also reproduced (poorly) from volume 3 of <a href="../sources.html#mc"><i>Collections</i></a>), running south from Hamilton Street, across Lydius Street (changed to Madison Avenue in 1867), past the former <a href="../loc/yatesmansion.html">Yates Mansion</a> (called Kane Mansion in Kane's Park on the map), and  continuing south across Ferry Street. 

<p>The block of South Pearl Street (south of Hamilton Street to Lydius) included the properties of Barent Sanders and the <a href="../bios/vz/vzandt.html">Van Zandts</a> (recalled today by Van Zandt Street) on the east side and those of the Hoghkerks, Mrs. Price, <a href="../bios/h/wmhenry8429.html">William Henry</a> (father of Joseph Henry), and others.

<p>South of Lydius: on the southeastern corner with South Pearl was Sheldon Mallery - a merchant at 76 Washington in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=%22mallery+sheldon%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22mallery%20sheldon%22&f=false">1813</a>. New Englander <a href="../bios/s/spstaff.html">Spencer Stafford</a> utilized land held by his wife's <a href="../bios/h/hallenbeck.html">family</a> to build along what became Madison Avenue. The sons of Hessian soldier-turned-storekeeper <a href="../bios/f/jcf8113.html">John C. Fredenrich</a> and the <a href="../bios/s/stafford.html">Staffords</a> also built near the intersection of South Pearl and Lydius. However, these references are most helpful for visualizing the mid-nineteenth century.

<p>Another, further continuation shows the <a href="../bios/c/geocharles7588.html">Ch</a>arles tannery, South Pearl Street running across the <a href="../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>, past <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a>, and almost to the <a href="../citylimits.html">city line</a>.  Beyond that, was Cherry Hill in <a href="../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. This entire settlment area falls under the legendary umbrella of the <a href="../loc/southend.html">South End</a>. Philip Schuyler's will divided the lands between his mansion and South Pearl Street among his <a href="../bios/s/esh.html">daughters</a>. Only a few years after his death, those lots were being sold to first-time owners.
<p>This reproduction likeness has been turned to facilitate examination. The top of the image faces South toward the part of the Manor that in 1793 became Bethlehem. It later was <a href="../citylimits.html">annexed</a> by the city of Albany. The original southern border crossed South Pearl Street about five blocks south of the Arch Street bridge. 

<p>We recognize that this presentation is marred by the poor quality of the images. Hopefully, we will be able to display them more clearly, coherently, and usefully before too long. <a href="../inprog.html">Please</a> bear with us on this.</p>
