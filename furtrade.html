            <b>F</b>rom the beginning, <a href="nnd.html">Europeans</a> found 
            procuring the <a href="#skins">skins</a> of furbearing animals to 
            be the one of the quickest and easiest ways to turn the natural bounty 
            of the North American wilderness into profits and wealth. This premier 
            economic activity was called the "Fur Trade," the "Indian Trade," 
            or simply "the Trade!"</p> 


          <p>Trading posts called Fort Nassau on <a href="na/castle.html">Castle Island</a> 
            and <a href="loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>, in 1614 and 1624 
            respectively, represented first steps in establishing the Dutch as 
            major participants in the North American fur trade. The Dutch West 
            India Company sought to maintain exclusive control of that enterprise 
            but was unable to enforce its trading monopoly in the face of settlers, 
            company employees, and interlopers - all of whom were determined to 
            pursue pelts for personal profit!</p>

          <p>In 1652, a <a href="cityfathers.html">core group</a> of these fur traders was 
            able to persuade the governor of New Netherland to create a separate 
            entity within and over the objections of the <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Van 
            Rensselaers</a> - proprietors of all the land around Fort Orange and 
            the legal contractors of many of those who instead sought to pursue 
            the fur trade on their own. The establishment of the <a href="sources.html#cmb">court</a> 
            of <a href="beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> recognized the fur trading community 
            and provided a focus for the settlement that was encircled by a <a href="map/map1676.html">stockade</a> 
            later in the decade and which became <a href="earlycity.html">Albany</a> 
            - a chartered city under the English in <a href="charter.html">1686</a>.</p>

          <p>The traders of Beverwyck and then Albany were successful in attracting 
            Native American hunters to the banks of the Hudson to bartered their 
            furs for shiny, brightly-colored, sweet, spirituous, and exotic trade 
            goods which the best capitalized of the traders secured on credit 
            from downriver or overseas. However, most Beverwyck/Albany fur traders 
            had limited access to imported trade goods. To <a href="makers.html">generate</a> 
            desirable trade goods, Albany people baked, brewed, heated and hammered, 
            and sewed items that brought furbearing Indians to the site of Albany 
            during the summer trading season.</p>

          <p>By 1660, the fur trade out of Beverwyck had become highly competitive with 
            opposing factions <a href="lists/list1660.html">petitioning</a> the 
            court for regulation on their behalfs. The establishment of <a href="na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, 
            among other things, <a href="#sources">represented</a> an effort on 
            the part of some frustrated traders to pre-empt the Beverwyck then 
            Albany sense of entitlement.</p>

<p>For some, this enterprise proved quite lucrative as a number of New Netherland pioneers amassed fortunes that could be invested in real estate or related trading enterprises. Based on success in the fur trade, a <a href="cityfathers.html">core group</a> established their families in Albany for generations to come!</p>

<p>During the 1650s, 60s, and <a href="census1679.html#cma">70s</a>, the so-called "Indian Trade" was highly competitive. Actual Albany residents were challenged by those engaging native hunters in the wilderness beyond Albany and by better-capitalized but wholly unwelcome would-be traders from downriver and from New England. In <a href="lists/list1681.html">1681</a>, a group of traders sought help in regulating the fur trade before the Albany court.</p>

          <p>After decades of determined hunting, by the 1660s beaver became increasingly 
            scare in what became New York State forcing the Iroquois to venture 
            into New France and the Great Lakes country for pelts. At the same 
            time, the European market for furs leveled off and then declined. 
            Despite the constraints of supply and demand, the fur trade remained 
            an important but no longer exclusive element of the Albany commercial 
            economy for the next hundred years.</p>

<p>Over the next century, trading parties went from Albany into the Indian country. Those adventures sometimes proved profitable and other times disastrous. The so-called <a href="bios/m/pamcgreg.html">Macgregorie Expedition</a> of 1687 represents an interesting chapter in that story.</p> 

<p>The <a href="charter.html">city charter</a> of 1686, gave Albany the singular right to deal with the Indians to the north and west. The English probably intended the provision to have a diplomatic function. However, Albany interpreted it to mean a fur trading monopoly.</p>

<p>During the 1690s and early 1700s, the Albany city fathers showed some determination in seeking to <a href="doc/cc/0627699.html">enforce</a> Albany's fur trading monopoly as a number of so-called "illegal traders" were brought before the Albany court! Included in that group were obvious outsiders but also city residents who were not born in Albany but who were property holders and visible members of the community.</p>

<p>At the same time, as Albany reached its capacity to absorb the more ordinary sons of city families who relocated to <a href="na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, Kinderhook, and Catskill - or into surrounding <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and beyond! Some continued to pursue the fur trade but many others turned to more agriculture-based enterprises.</p>

          <p>With the establishment of <a href="na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> during the 1720s, 
            the active center of the fur trade moved west with Albany traders 
            keeping stores there and beyond with some Albany people finding their 
            way to Niagara and out in the Great Lakes region (Detroit). These 
            outposts typically were manned by younger sons of established Albany 
            families. With greater <a href="albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> 
            filling up with new settlers following the end of <a href="7yw.html">hostilities</a> 
            with the French, the leading Albany merchants focused more and more 
            on servicing a European-ancestry clientele as British settlement restrictions 
            sought to close off the West to the colonists. 
          <p>By that time, the fur trade was in trouble and Albany business people turned to the British for help. In 1764, a large number of Albany-based merchants and traders <a href="lists/list1764.html">petitioned</a> the royal government for more regulation of the fur trade.</p>

          <p><a name=ft></a><b>This essay</b> is intended to describe early Albany's most important 
            <a href="econ/comec.html">economic activity</a>. At this point, it 
            is only an entry page and is very much <a href="inprog.html">in-progress</a>. 
            In time, this page will provide access to information about the mechanics 
            of the fur trade, its place in the early Albany economy, and will 
            suggest <a href="#sources">sources</a> for further study. Please be 
            patient!</p>  

          <p><a name=image></a>This drawing of a <b>fur trading scene</b> set on upper <a href="streets.html#maiden">Maiden 
            Lane</a> in 1686 was made by <A 
href="http://www.lftantillo.com">Len Tantillo</a> in 1985 for a <a href="tricentennial.html">Tricentennial 
            Program</a>. Portraying the negotiation between Native American hunter/traders 
            and Albany merchants outside of a house on upper <a href="streets.html#maiden">Maiden 
            Lane</a> and in the open space below the <a href="loc/fortalbany.html">Albany 
            fort</a>, we believe it is the most telling and accurate depiction 
            of the most important economic activity of Albany's first years.</p>  

          <p><a name=skins></a><b>". . . skins of furbearing animals"</b> is a term of convenience 
            used to describe the commodity European traders were so anxious to 
            obtain and export. At that time, it could mean many things! It refers 
            first to beaver - the most desirable of the readily obtainable furs 
            - and in-demand in Europe for hats, coats, and finery. But virtually 
            all other furbearing animals were hunted as well. It also refers to 
            cleaned but not processed skins. The hides of deer and farm animals 
            were used to make leather - a staple of the early Albany <a href="makers.html">production 
            economy</a>.</p>

          <p><a name=sources></a><b>Sources:</b>The most useful books on the colonial fur 
            trade are: Oliver Rink's <a href="books.html#rink"><i>Holland on the 
            Hudson</i></a>, which provides access to earlier works; Alan Trelease, 
            <i>Indian Affairs in Colonial New York: The Seventeenth Century</i> 
            (Ithaca, 1960, reprinted 1971), a seminal study; Thomas E. Burke, 
            Jr., <a href="books.html#burke"><i>Mohawk Frontier</i></a>; and Thomas 
            E. Norton, <i>The Fur Trade in Colonial New York</i>. All these deal 
            with Albany but in a larger perspective. The only serious study of 
            the <b>Albany</b> fur trade was produced by <a href="books.html#armour">David 
            A. Armour</a> in 1965. The beginnings of an answer to "what happened 
            to the fur trade?", can be found in Walter S. Dunn, <i>People of the 
            American Frontier: The Coming of the Revolution</i> (Westport CT, 
            2005) <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2JRF5E_dMeoC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=People+of+the+American+Frontier:+The+Coming+of+the+Revolution&source=bl&ots=AdbjrZavsv&sig=Wc9unfhXIzIbKqncZboqTk_QZPA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FW4MVI3HKI_hsATpx4CAAg&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=People%20of%20the%20American%20Frontier%3A%20The%20Coming%20of%20the%20Revolution&f=false">partially online</a>, which is set in the Indian Country from <a href="na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> to the west. The business of a number of Albany traders (and their kin) during and after the <a href="7yw.html">Seven Years War</a> is considered with <a href="bios/vs/hvschaack.html">Henry Van Schaack</a> as a central character - a dimension not readily visible from within the community-based record. </p>
