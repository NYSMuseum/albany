<blockquote>After many years of correcting dead links to the following often-handy material, we have <a href="../res/trans.html">transcribed and transformed</a> the passages below from Joel Munsell's <a href="../guide/histres.html#munsell"><i>Annals of Albany</i></a>. None of his judgments have been critiqued yet his <a href="../res/ts.html">wisdom</a> still represents a convenient place to start. Volumes and pages are given and linked as consistently and closely as we can whenever possible. "We" kinda suck at this.</blockquote>

<p><font size=+1>DUTCH NAMES OF PERSONS, PLACES, AND THINGS</font size> 
<p>AND THEIR SIGNIFICATION IN ENGLISH
<br>ILLUSTRATIVE OF SOME PASSAGES WHICH OCCUR IN THIS WORK, AND CORRECTIVE OF THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF DUTCH WORDS OCCASIONALLY USED<p>

<p>Abeel, a poplar. 

<br>Acker, or properly Akker, a field<br> 

Ackerman, a farmer<br> 

Allen, all<br> 

Appel, an apple<br> 

Arts, a physician<br> 

Avery, an average
<p>
Baas, (vulgarly written bos) a master; a preacher is a kerkbaas, a master carpenter is a timmerman's baas<br> 
Baker, a dry nurse<br> 
Bakhuis, a bakehouse, also chops, face; as houd uw bak- 

huis, hold your jaw<br> 
Bakker, a baker<br> 
Bank, a bench ; whence, perhaps the term used in printing 

offices<br> 

Bedroefd, sad, sorrowful<br> 
Beeren Island, bear's island, (corrupted to Barren Island,) 

an island in Hudson river<br> 
Berg, a mountain or hill<br> 
Beverwyk, beaver retreat ; there is a town of this name on 

the maps of Holland, but it does not seem to have 

suggested the name once used for this city<br> 
Sleeker, a bleacher<br> 

Bliksem, lightning; erroneously written blixem<br> 
Blokhuys, a wooden fort<br> 
Boedel, an estate, or effects<br> 
Boksen, breeches ; corrupted to boxem<br> 
Bonk, a bone<br> 

Bouwer, a builder; also a tiller<br> 
Bouwery, a farm, now written Bowery. Bowery street in 

New York originally led to Gov. Stuyvesant's farm or 

bouwery<br> 



Brief, a letter or bill. 

JBroek, a marsh, breech. 

Burg, a fortress, or borough ; often confounded with berg 
in names of places, and corruptly printed with an h final 
in both cases, as in Lansingburgh. 

Burger, a citizen; often written with an h, erroneously. 
<p>
Durip, Schenectady ; corruption of Dorp, a village. 

<p>Coxsackie. boil the bag; unless it should be written Cox- 
hacky, as it is frequently in the records, when it would 
seem to be an Indian term. 

De Graaf, the count. 
<p>Ernst, zeal. 
<p>Gasthuys, a hospital. 
Groot, great. 
<p>
Haagedoorn, a bramble bush, a thorn hedge. 

Handel, trade, traffic. 

Handelaar, a merchant ; Handelaer street was the ancient 
name of Broadway. 

Handschoon, a glove. Some among the English have been 
ready to carp at this word as an evident token of the 
scantiness of the Dutch language; but let us consider 
whether our horse shoe is a more proper expression and 
whether the Dutch hoefyzer (hoof iron) be not full as 
appropriate. Doubtless in every language there are some 
words more significant than the same words in others. 

Helderberg, clear mountain or hill. 

Helgat, hell hole; a rough term for a rough place in the 
sound between New York and Long Island, which is 
usually written hell gate, and by some sensitive persons 
corrupted to hurl gate. The preservation of the original 
orthography would have divested the term of much that 
is deemed objectionable to ears polite. 

Hoofdkaas, head cheese. 

<p>Kanaal, the channel; whence the burlesque term canawl, 
which is the pronunciation of the Dutch word. 

Kar, a cart; whence comes the word carman, instead of 
cartman, as is used in most cities of this state. 

Kasteel, a castle. 

Kerk, a church, 

Kerker, a prison, jail. 


Kerkhof, churchyard. 

Keyser, emperor. 

Kinderhoek, children's point. 

Kip, a hen. 

Klaverack, clover-reach. 

Kleyn (whence Cline) Jittle. 

Kling, a sword. 

Klink, a latch ; also a slap with the hand. 

Knecht, a servant ; a bouw-knecht is a farm servant. Some 
have mistaken this term, and been led to believe that 
their ancestors were knights! 

Knikkerbakker, marble baker; now almost universally 
written Knickerbocker, after the usage of Washington 
Irving: pronounced as if written K'n-nik-ker-bok-ker 
perhaps to distinguish it from nikker, a fiend or devil. 
Those Dutch names among us terminating in ck, such 
as Ten Eyck, Ten Broeck, Groesbeck, &c., were not so 
written under the Dutch dynasty, and are not in accord- 
ance with the true orthography of the language. The 
letter c is very seldom used anywhere except before h, 
and at the beginning of a very few words, mostly of 
foreign extraction. 

Koekebakker, a gingerbread baker. 

Kool-slaa, cabbage salad. 

Koon, a jaw or cheek.

Roggen, rye. 

Romeyn, a roman. 

Rooseboom, rose tree 

Roosekrans, a garland of roses. 

Rutten kill, supposed to mean rat's kill, although Judge Bensen, (see vol. 2, p. 226) derives its name from Rut- ger Bleeker, as many think quite erroneously. 
<p>Snyder, tailor,. 
Spook, ghost. 
Steenberg, stone hill. 
Stoep, pavement, threshold, steps ; written stoop universally 

with us, which is the term for a measure of two quarts. 
Stuyver, a penny. 
<p>Ten Broek, at the marsh. 
Ten Eyk, at the oak. 
<p>Verreberg, far mountain.

Van, of, from. 

Van Vechten, from the combat. 
Vanderzee, from the sea. 
Van Steenberg, from stone hill. 
Van Zandt, from the sand.
