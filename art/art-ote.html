<p><font size=+2>A</font size>t its chartering as a city, Albany was an <a href="../earlycity.html">urban community</a> whose wooden stockade enclosed about 150 buildings that were homes and work places for its 500 people. Those early Albanians mostly were the children of the founders of the community who forty years earlier had come together to ship out animal furs bartered from the Native American hunters who had been drawn to Albany by a variety of interesting and inexpensive trade goods. The Dutch West India Company recruited Albany's <a href="../nnd.html">original settlers</a> from across Europe with the Germans, Scandinavians, continental lowlanders, and émigrés from the British Isles almost equal to the number of actual natives of the Netherlands. By the 1650s, many of them had found partners in <a href="../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> - Albany's ancestor, and were raising families.</p>

<p>Albany's native-born sons and daughters too had followed the <a href="../furtrade.html">fur 
  trade</a> but now were becoming collectors, processors, and shippers of farm 
  and forest products and importers of supplies for a growing regional settler 
  population. This commercial group had controlled the <a href="../econ/comec.html">community's 
  economy</a> since its founding and quickly learned to manipulate the English 
  provincial government for special privileges and patents for wilderness land. 
  Albany's <a href= "../makers.html">artisans and craftsmen,</a> who formerly 
  hammered, honed, and hemmed fur-trading items in their home workshops, now looked 
  to supply hinterland farmers with processed and crafted products. Business, 
  commerce, production, and a growing service economy based on river and overland 
  transportation and on food, lodging, processing, and repair services all came 
  together to make Albany the regional center recognized by royal governor Thomas 
  Dongan with a <a href="../charter.html">municipal charter</a> in 1686. With 
  its court, city and county registry, regional market, fort, and churches, Albany 
  had emerged as the administrative center of a huge <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany 
  County</a> established in 1683. By that time, Albany was secure as New York's 
  second center and its people were cementing social and economic ties regionally 
  and to Manhattan that only began with kinship.<a href="#1.">1.</a><br> 

<p>While Albany County became the largest in the colony, over the next hundred 
  years, the city of Albany grew more slowly despite a healthy natural increase 
  of 8-10 births in a typical city household. By 1700, Albany had reached its 
  capacity to absorb its native sons in traditional community-based activities. 
  Most of them would find their destinies beyond the stockade. Some like Rip Van 
  Dam, Jacob Wendell, and Philip Livingston distinguished themselves in other 
  settings. Many became tenants of the Van Rensselaers or other regional landlords. 
  Others farmed city land at <a href="../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. And 
  still others disappeared into the obscurity of the American wilderness. Their 
  places on city streets were taken by a small but steady <a href="../newcomers.html">stream 
  of young men</a> whose new skills and talents made them desirable partners for 
  the daughters of New Netherland - thus displacing brothers and cousins who relocated 
  to new market communities like Schenectady, Kinderhook, and Catskill, or to 
  a larger agricultural countryside beyond <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
  New Albany people included some New Netherland-ancestry emigres from downriver 
  like the Cuylers and the Ten Eycks - who struggled to wring benefits from a 
  fading fur trade; individual opportunists like <a href="../bios/l/rlivingston94.html">Robert 
  Livingston</a> - whose outstanding talents made him an instant success; English 
  and <a href="../bios/irish.html">Irish</a> garrison soldiers - including the Barrets, Hiltons, Radcliffs, and 
  <a href="../bios/y/yates.html">Yateses</a> who became colonial Albany's largest 
  immigrant group; Scottish traders and tradesmen named Glen, Henry, and Sanders; 
  French Marselises, Pruyns, and <a href="../bios/d/degarmo.html">De Garmos</a>; 
  German Abels, Hogstrassers, and Rubys; Spanish Van Zandts; and <a href="../afroalbanians.html">African-ancestry</a> 
  slaves who were brought in by city merchants, raised their own families within 
  Albany households, emerged from slavery during the era of the American Revolution, 
  and who accounted for between ten and twenty percent of Albany's population 
  throughout the eighteenth century. These diverse peoples came together in Albany 
  homes to further tone the social mosaic.<a href="#2.">2.</a><br> 

<p>During the first half of the eighteenth-century, Albany began to move from outpost to entrepot as the business community followed an international market away from the fur trade - instead establishing trade relationships with a growing number of regional farmers and husbandmen. Prosperous city merchants brought a volume of varied commodities to Albany, which they prepared and marketed with the support of extensive networks in the city's production and service economies. Traditional <a href="../makers.html">tradesmen and craftsmen</a> turned out wooden, metal, cloth, and animal products for city, countryside, and military use - as well as for Native American markets. During this time, Albany's makers and fixers resided in virtually every city family and became the largest part of the community economy. But they were beginning to be rivaled by those involved in service activities represented by a large Albany fleet of sloops and other river boats, a growing number of inns and taverns, and the rise of tanning pits, asheries, and mill sites within site of the core city.

<p>During a <a href="../peace.html">three-decade respite</a> from frontier warfare 
  (1713-44), the Hudson-Mohawk region attracted new settlers - who mostly only 
  briefly stopped at Albany to change transport and obtain supplies. During this 
  time, Albany city spread out along the river as its population doubled to over 
  2,000 by 1750. Now in their third and fourth generations in America, the New 
  Netherland Dutch remained an overwhelming majority - although the number of 
  New Netherland family names on city rolls fell from 80 to 50 during that time. 
  New brick buildings filled in State, Market, Court, and Pearl Streets, while 
  smaller frame dwellings of tradesmen and transporters began to ring the central 
  commercial core. Beyond that were stables, sheds, shops, and storehouses as 
  Albany had become the loading point for lumber, grain, and other exportable 
  goods as well as the processing and repair center for an emerging region. New 
  public buildings - a three-story <a href="../loc/cityhall.html">city hall</a>/courthouse/jail, 
  a massive <a href="../drc.html">Reformed Church</a> located in the middle of 
  the main intersection, an <a href="../stpeters.html">Anglican (Episcopal) church</a>, 
  an enlarged <a href="../loc/fortalbany.html#eights">stone fort</a>, and the 
  development of another sixteen blocks within an expanded stockade further signified 
  that Albany was no longer just a fortified village.<a href="#3.">3.</a> 
<p>With the New York frontier a major arena of action, the <a href="../7yw.html">Great 
  War for Empire</a> (1754-63) changed Albany forever. Frontier refugees, provincial 
  troops, British soldiers, and an army of civilian newcomers seeking to serve 
  them inundated the city during the 1750s - bursting traditional boundaries, 
  setting new standards for opportunism, and placing great strain on a community 
  economy that had been only better than self-sustaining in the past. The British 
  built barracks, a large <a href="../loc/hospital.html">hospital</a>, many supporting 
  structures, and pushed general settlement into areas that had been avoided as 
  too hilly or wet in the past. Except for officers, few city men served in provincial 
  armies. Instead they were put to work transporting soldiers and supplies, procuring 
  and preparing food and fodder, and making and fixing shoes, wagons, and kettles. 
  The war had stimulated Albany's service and production economies but also exposed 
  a once-closed commercial environment to external competition embodied by Scottish 
  traders and by newcomers from New York, New England, and the other colonies. 
  Albany's traditional merchants struggled in a post-war economy where success 
  was based on access to imported items and external sources of credit. 
<p>The end of the war, a wave of European immigration and the flooding of America with European products brought thousands of new people to and through Albany and drove home a number of lessons learned from Albany's first, first-hand experiences with the British and their policies. Finding their handcrafted items no longer competitive with imported products, Albany artisans were driven into repair work and to other services and found themselves less able to place their sons in traditional trades than in the past. Barred from manufacturing by Imperial restrictions, would-be craftsmen either left the city or embraced the shipping, lodging, and processing activities of Albany's growing service economy. At the same time, local ambitions for land patents, contracts, and appointments - frequently attainable in the past, were increasingly diverted to newcomers and others in the region who were more closely connected with the royal government and with British policies. And finally, Albany people had suffered harsh treatment at the hands of the British army during the war leaving many of these third and fourth generation Americans to wonder who would protect them from the British once the French and Indians were no longer a threat.<a href="#4.">4.</a> 

<p>Between 1763 and 1775, colonial Albany underwent a final transformation. Its 
  fortified character dissolved with the dismantling of the stockade in favor 
  of a sprawling, <a href="../im/im1770.html">again-expanded settlement</a>. The 
  closing of the fort and disposal of most of the military buildings ended a century 
  of reliance on a military presence in favor of an even more self-serving and 
  still-evolving way of life that included many more important newcomers than 
  at any time since the community's founding. Beginning in 1765, the city government 
  underwrote construction of large docks and the development of the waterfront 
  - thus creating landing and loading facilities that solidified Albany's role 
  as the major upriver port. An Albany fleet of sloops and lesser watercraft emerged 
  to dominate the regional carrying trade but also reached beyond the Hudson Valley 
  - sailing to the other colonies and to the Caribbean. The first roads radiating 
  from city streets <a href="../loc/kingshighway.html">connecting</a> Albany to 
  Schenectady and to the agrarian hinterland and blurred the city/countryside 
  distinction more pronounced in the past. The outer bounds of the city now were 
  defined by <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a>, <a href="../na/whitehall.html">Whitehall</a>, 
  "the Patroon's" <a href="../na/vrmh.html">manor house</a>, and other new country 
  homes of Albany's leading families and most important newcomers. <a href="../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>, 
  a new settlement area north of today's Clinton Avenue, was filling fast with 
  newcomers whose daily toil helped fuel Albany's economy. These immigrant and 
  migrant tenants of the Van Rensselaers spread out along the river and outnumbered 
  the residents of the core city.</p>

<p>New, larger buildings began to appear on the main streets and the advertisements 
  of new State, Court, and Market Street import merchants stood out on the pages 
  of the <a href="../ag.html">Albany Gazette</a> - the city's first newspaper 
  founded in 1771. Intersecting the <a href="../streets.html">main thoroughfares</a>, 
  Hudson, Green, Barrack, Chapel, and Water Streets were peopled by secondary 
  businessmen, crafts and tradesmen, innkeepers, transporters, and a growing working 
  class - who all represented both old Albany and recently arrived backgrounds. 
  These people were served by new <a href="../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
  and <a href="../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> churches, a new city <a href="../loc/markethouse.html">market 
  house</a>, and a municipal government forced to meet new responsibilities occasioned 
  by increased and more intensive settlement. 
<p>By the <a href="../lastdays.html">eve of the American Revolution</a>, densely inhabited and ethnically diverse Albany had evolved into a bustling urban center. Greater Albany's 6,000 people fed a diversified community economy that served its people, an agricultural hinterland, an immense northern frontier, and a foreign market as well. Intense social and cultural changes over the past decade had created many new paradigms. Most city people struggled with these and were left feeling slighted and frustrated by their plight within the British Empire. In the Imperial scheme of things, cities were nerve centers and were located in England. The British would have preferred the colonies to have only market towns. But like a dozen other American urban centers, Albany was a city in every sense of the word. Underlying these realizations was the fact that most Albany people were not of English origins and felt no inherent kinship with a British   Empire. Those who did became increasingly alienated from an Albany majority, who between 1774 and 1776, would come to understand that their destiny was no longer tied to the British.<a href="#5.">5.</a></p>
