      <p><a href="#source">P</A>eerless American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin">Benjamin 
        Franklin</a> came to Albany at least twice and possibly another time during 
        the eighteenth century. We hope to add to this exposition on Franklin 
        in Albany in the <a href="../inprog.html">future</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../albanycongress.html"><img src="../images/jpg/lithgowalbanycongressbf.jpg" align=right width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="Franklin at the Albany Congress"></a>In June 1754, accompanied by three others, he headed the Pennsylvania delegation to the <a href="../albanycongress.html">Albany Congress</a>. On his way from Philadelphia to Albany, Franklin later  <a href="http://www.earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/chapt12/">said</a> that he "projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government." Although the delegates at Albany finally approved the plan, it later would not be adopted by the separate provincial governments.
 
<p>Between June and November <a href="http://www.english.udel.edu/lemay/franklin/american.html">1763</a>, Deputy Postmaster Franklin visited <a href="../org/po.html">post offices</A> in New York and New England. Did he stop in Albany? 

<p>Although seventy-years-old and <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=boils+%22benjamin+franklin%22">suffering</a> from boils, swollen legs, and dizziness, from the end of March to the end of May 1776, Franklin and a distinguished delegation of Revolutionaries including <a href="../doc/carroll1776.html">Charles and John Carroll</a> undertook a diplomatic mission to Montreal on behalf of the Continental Congress. 

<p>Marylander Charles Carroll described the trip in his journal. The party ascended the Hudson on a sloop and <a href="../doc/carroll1776.html">arrived</a> 
        in Albany on April 6. In Albany, they were the guests of <a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
        Schuyler</a>, at his Albany <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">home</a>. 
        Carroll later <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-28BAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22+7th%22+albany&source=bl&ots=McwCh4znYU&sig=urUsuR0OS14dkcoq1X4MXWZ43Wc&hl=en&ei=Aj4AS5yxNo2MnQfU46SYCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=&f=false">reported</a> 
        that they were treated with great civility in Albany. However, they do 
        not seem to have met formally with the <a href="../coc.html">Albany Committee</a>. 
        Two days later, the delegates were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PT8vAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA240&lpg=PA239&dq=franklin+albany+carroll&source=bl&ots=L8yrfHbsbj&sig=bJyfCq5xYcyf98aBb12nvSIOOI0&hl=en&ei=gjEAS5KkAsfZnAfdwM2bCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=albany&f=false">carried</a> 
        overland by wagon to Schuyler's country home at Saratoga, and from there 
        to Montreal by early May. By early June, Franklin had returned to Philadelphia. 
        From all accounts, a month in the wilderness nearly killed him! <br>
