<p>Sailed from the Kings wharf at the North River at a Quarter before four o'Clock P. M. with the flood and a Southerly Wind—Supped about Sundown opposite to Tappan, and the Wind failing & the Tide coming Against us came to an anchor at Verdrietiije Hook: * [Verdrietafic's Hook: The bold headland, on the West bank of the Hudson, two or three miles North of Nyack. and known among the old people, in that vicinity, as The Hook Mountain. It is a spur of the Ramapo Range which extends along the Northwestern border of Rocklaud-couuty; and has always been a notable landmark among the skippers on the North-river.] where we went To Sleep.

<p>Thursday <b>June 23rd</b> This morning the Wind being against us could not make Sail till 8 O'Clock, when we weighed Anchor and proceeded on our Voyage

<p>Mr M'Dougall came on board much afflicted with the Gout, but as he got a Comfortable Sleep yesterday and also Slept very well in the Night lie found himself much better

<p>At 12 o'clock we got at the entrance of the Highlands, it being then high water; but luckily a fresh Southerly Wind took us, carried us against Tide to opposite the old Landing at Poughkeepsie, where we sent on Shore at about 6 o'Clock P. M. and got some Milk of Mr. Paul Sehenk, after which, drank Tea, and continued under Sail from thence, with the flood in our favor, and at about 1 o' Clock in the Morning came to an Anchor opposite the Manor of Livingston [Manor of Livingston — Clermont. Columbia-county, where the seat of that ancient Manor is. The "Colonel Livingston." referred to was probably, Colonel Henry B. Livingston, subsequently of the Army of the Revolution, a brother of the Chancellor.]

<p>We had a good deal of Rain from 4, o'Clock in the Afternoon till 4 o'Clock the next morning

<p>Mr. McDougall was much worse this Day & the following Night, owing to the Southerly wind & Rain: he had an exceeding painful Night of it, with the Gout in both feet & Right hand; however he found himself easier in the Morning

<p>In the Interim Commodore Grant went on Shore at Col. Livingston's at abt. 7 o'Clock in the Morning, and returned shortly niter with the Colonels compliments to the Passengers, requesting their company at Breakfast: The company returned their thanks, being all Invalids, & therefore could not accept of his kind invitation — The Commodore however went & took Breakfast with Mr. Livingston

<p>Here we overtook Capt. <a href="../bios/g/groesbeck.html">Groesbeeck</a> who left New York Ten Hours before us with Several Gentlemen of the Law, on board, in order to Attend the Supreme Court at Albany, which is to begin, there on Tuesday the 28th Instant

<p>About 0 O'Clock, Commodore Grant returned on board with a fat Sheep, being a present from Col" Livingston to some poor people lately Arrived from <a href="../bios/irish.html">Scot</a>land, with intent to Settle Some part of this Country which was a Seasonable relief to them

<p>About 10 'Clock weighed Anchor & beat it up against Tide to a little about Kinderhook Creek, where the Tide came against us & obliged us to come too.

<p>Here the Captain of the sloop went on Shore at the House of <a href="#staats">Johs Staats</a> within the bounds of <a href="../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>, and brought on Board some Bread, Eggs & Milk

<p>About 2 O'Clock in the Morning we got under Sail Again, and at o'Clock on SaturDay Morning

<p><b>June The 25th</b> came to an Anchor at Coejemans, [a well-known landing in Albany-county, on the West side of the Hudson] opposite to the House where Mr. Anthony <a href="../bios/t/teneyck.html">Ten Eyck</a> now lives — Mr. Ten Eyck being informed who was on board of the Sloop by my Boy Pompey, sent his Compliments and desired the Company to Breakfast with him; Commodore Grant, Capt. White, and myself went on Shore & Breakfasted with Mr. Ten Eyck, Mrs. Ten Eyck the family, who were all very well except Mr. Ten Eyck, who laboured under a severe fit of the Piles, and appeared to be otherwise much indisposed.

<p>We were made very Welcome here and were supplied with Salad & Parsley, and Milk, and indeed we were offered everything we might stand in Need of, to Eat on board.
 
<p>At About 1 o'Clock P.M. we weighed Anchor, and with a very light Southerly wind got up to the Hooge Bergh, at about 8 o'Clock;

<p>At Nine we returned on board, when the Commodore & Capt. White resumed the Game of Piquet (at which they had been engaged in the afternoon) and by Ten o'Clock, left off, when Mr. White was 12 Games ahead

 
<p>We then went to Bed, and at about o'Clock, on
 
<p>Sunday Morning, <b>June 26th</b> weighed Anchor, and there being no Wind & but a very Scanty flood were under a Necessity of make use of Oars to get forward.

<p>Excerpted from a text generally titled <b>A JOURNAL OF A VOYAGE TO ALBANY, ETC., MADE BY ABRAHAM LOTT, TREASURER OF THE COLONY OF NEW YORK, 1774</b> and printed in <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Historical_Magazine.html?id=gScSAAAAYAAJ">The Historical Magazine</a></i>, vol. 8:2, pp. 65-74 (August 1870). Albany related material begins on page 66. The so-called manuscript source of this offering was said to be "Copied Verbatim, from the Original in Possession of his Family." Also noted that "We are indebted, for this interesting Journal, to our valued friend, C. C. Dawson, Esq., of New Jersey."

</font size><dd><FONT size=-1>It appears that the "root" source of this work has been its appearance in <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Historical_Magazine.html?id=gScSAAAAYAAJ">The Historical Magazine</a></i>. That version is available <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PvIOAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA65&lpg=RA1-PA65&dq=%22abraham+lott%22+journal+historical+magazine&source=bl&ots=JV_hVOrgKK&sig=aJcyhXxWq75rIk2RlXetk-nNRR4&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20lott%22%20journal%20historical%20magazine&f=false">online</a> in a number of formats. It has been adopted and adapted here for convenience. The whereabouts of an "original" manuscript is <a href="../bios/qqqq.html">unknown</a> to us at this time.

<p><b>Transcription</b>/transformation: Our goal is to present the printed text online in as clear a manner as possible. Some liberties with the original presentation (and with spellings and punctuations as well) have been taken in the name of clarity. Generally, we have omitted footnote references presented in the so-called original because they are redundant and/or irrelevant in the Albany-centered context. We recognize that this so-called source is at least once removed from an original manuscript. It is a classic "<a href="../victorian.html">Victorianization</a>!" At the time of its printing of Lott's journal, the magazine was owned by premier antiquarian and New York author of the day, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_B._Dawson">Henry B. Dawson</a>.

<p><a name=lott></a><b>Abraham Lott</b>: The numerous "Abraham Lotts" have been confused by historians and also by genealogists. This particular Abraham Lott (1714-1801) - the "treasurer of the colony of New York," was the son of Abraham and Catherine Hegeman Lott. He married "Geertruy Coeyman" of New Jersey.  <a href="http://www.lottfamilyhistory.belnapfamily.org/Phillips_Lott_Family_in_America_(1942).pdf"> least confusing resource</a>, #46 = perhaps pp. 40-.
