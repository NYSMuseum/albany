            <p><b>I</b>n the summer of 1815, an Albany businessman named Joseph Fry issued 
              his third annual register and <a href="../sources.html#ad">directory</a> 
              of the residents of the city. Following a conventional format, the 
              1815 edition began with rosters of the public officials. It then 
              listed physicians, boat captains, city licensees, officers of Albany's 
              banks, education institutions, other incorporated enterprises, social 
              organizations, and the chiefs of a number of Albany based civic 
              and moral improvement groups whom today we might call "lobbyists." 
              The directory included <a href="../population.html">population</a> 
              and election statistics and more miscellaneous information that 
              Fry promised, on the directory's title page, would prove to be "other 
              interesting Matter."</p>
<p>But the principal feature of what was known as "Fry's Albany
Directory" was a 64 page alphabetical list of the principal 
residents of the city of Albany.<a href="#1"><sup><font size=-1>1</font size></sup></a> Considerably larger than its more 
rudimentary predecessors, the 1815 edition graphically revealed that
Albany was in the midst of a period of dramatic growth. Founded
in the mid-seventeenth century and <a href="../charter.html">chartered</a> as a city in 1686.

             <p><a name=pop></a>Albany's resident population, 
                for a variety of reasons, grew slowly, reaching 3,498 people by 
                the first federal <a href="../census1790.html">census in 1790</a>. 
                In each of the following decades, however, the city's population 
                almost doubled. The rapid growth was based on the maturation of 
                the city's traditional roles as a regional market and service 
                center, transportation interchange and jumping-off place for the 
                West, and by its new status as capital of the Empire State. The 
                coming of migrants from New England and other states and the arrival 
                of European immigrants more than offset the outmigration of many 
                traditional early Albany families. The only boundary change made 
                before the Civil War added a populated section on the northern 
                edge of the City in 1812. Formerly part of <a href="../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>, 
                new neighborhoods called <a href="../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor 
                Hill</a> and North Albany contributed substantially to the city's 
                population. By the end of the War of 1812, a one-time frontier 
                outpost had become one of the fastest growing urban centers in 
                North America.<a href="#2"><sup><font size=-3>2</font size></sup></a> 
                <a name=fpc></a>
            

<p>The 1815 directory named 2,394 individuals (up from 1,596 in 1813) and listed more precisely the addresses, activities, and characteristics of not only the traditional <a href="../census.html">heads of households</a> but of a growing number of individuals who were living in the city and not under a kinship umbrella. The newest feature of the 1815 edition was explained by a notation on the last line of the preface stating that "Those persons whose names are in Italics are <b>free people of color</b>."</p>

              <p>This reference to the city's <a href="../map/blackhouseholds1815.html">African-American 
                householders </a> was the earliest printed manifestation of what 
                could be called a "<a href="../afroalbanians.html">black community</a>." 
                However, Albanians of African ancestry had lived in city households 
                for almost two centuries. During that time, blacks had accounted 
                for between 10 to 20 percent of the city's population, had lived 
                in 30 to 50 percent of the city's households, and, in general, 
                had been overlooked as individuals. They rarely appeared on local 
                government, business, and church rolls that readily identified 
                most community members of European ancestry. But in 1815, the 
                placement of forty italicized names in "Fry's Albany Directory" 
                identified a significant minority group as part of the mainline 
                city.</p>

              <p>The addresses listed in the directory reveal that most of Albany's black households 
                inhabited the <a href="../streets.html">streets </a> near the 
                river and the more recently developed areas on the northern, southern, 
                and western edge of the city. (See <a href="../map/blackhouseholds1815.html">map</a>) 
                They also were clustered on Fox Street, at the South Ferry, and 
                near the intersection of South Pearl and Bassett Streets in the 
                South End." African-American householders were most often identified 
                with transportation-related occupations. These included two ferrymen, 
                seven watermen, and two carters; although both Benjamin Lattimore 
                and John Burns were identified as licensed cartmen in another 
                section of the same directory. Six men were called laborers. Others 
                were connected with the community's <a href="../peoplestreet.html">service 
                industries</a> : three grocers, a sweep, a butcher, a barber, 
                a shoemaker, and four shoeblacks. Two were more exceptional (a 
                skipper and a musician), and three others were widows. The directory 
                listed seven free black men, including Lattimore and Burns, without 
                indicating their occupation.</p>

<p>For the record, the householders identified as free people of color in the 1815 "Fry's Directory" were John Burns, laborer, Water Street; Francis Connor, shoeblack, 97 State; the widow of Fortune Cujay, 208 S.

<p><a name=1815></a>Though the directory claimed that it would italicize the names
of free people of color, it did not always do so. Those included in
the alphabetical listing but not in italics, though clearly identifiable
as of African background from other sources (sometimes in subsequent directories,) were Thomas Adams, 63 Maiden Lane; <a href="../bios/a/thallicott7126.html">Thomas Allicot</a>, 63 Columbia; Louis Davis, barber, Lodge St.; Josiah Divol

              <p>The listings provide the bare bones of an individual's existence. They raise 
                compelling questions about the origins of these community residents. 
                Where were they born? How long had they been free? What brought 
                them to Albany? How did they live? And what were their individual 
                and collective roles in the growth and development of the then 
                booming <a href="art-albcc.html">city of Albany</a>?</p>

<p><a name=seek></a>Since 1982, the Colonial Albany Social History Project has been
engaged in a community-based research program that provides
answers to some of these questions. In the course of a comprehensive 
sweep of Albany's historical record, the project has recovered
literally thousands of references to individuals, both white and black,
who meet the <a href="../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion in the Colonial Albany Project's
study population: born before the end of 1800 and can be 
documented as a resident of the city of Albany, or were the children 
of resident parents, or were married to a city resident. The total study
population numbers add up to approximately 16,000 historical 
personages, and these "people of colonial Albany" have been under intensive study for more than a decade. Most of them were of European ancestry,
chiefly	the descendants of the so-called <a href="../nnd.html"> New Netherland Dutch</a>, an
ethnically diverse group of pioneers who came to America before
1664, the British -English, Scots and Irish- who <a href="../newcomers.html">settled</a> in Albany 
during the English colonial period; German, French, and others 
from continental Europe; and a large number of American migrants, 
chiefly from New England and New Jersey.</p>

<p>During the course of this research, the project has compiled a
massive file of references to contemporary people of color, both
slave and free, who were born in Albany or who came to the 
community to serve one of the above-mentioned groups. Blacks were
not named in any of the comprehensive surveys of householders
for the colonial period that provided the backbone definition of the
city's base population. But the African presence has been well documented 
in the same sources since the mid-seventeenth century.<a href="#3"><sup><font size=-1>3</font size></sup></a><a name=slave></a> </p>

<p>From the earliest days of the community, Albany <a href="../furtrade.html">traders</a>, <a href="../makers.html">tradesmen</a>, 
and transporters utilized black bondsmen to offset a chronic labor 
shortage. An even larger number of female slaves were employed as 
domestic and personal servants in city households. Their presence in 
Albany has been established in legal documents, business records, 
and literary sources. Slaves and their children sometimes were baptized 
in Albany churches but then were sold, bequeathed, and otherwise 
transferred as property from one owner to the next. Although the 
colonial census schedules reveal that Negro slaves accounted for more 
than 10 percent of Albany's population during the eighteenth century, 
the Colonial Albany Project's examination of community-based and 
external records could identify only a relatively small number of 
individuals. A projected total of the city's African Americans would 
approach 1,600 city people or one-tenth of a base population of about 
16,000 city residents before 1800. While people of color were identified 
in the records of government, businesses, the courts, churches, and 
virtually all other community-based resources, the evidence is not 
detailed enough to represent this significant minority in general 
discussions of the home, workplace, or community decision making.<a href="#4"><sup><font size=-1>4</font size></sup></a> </p>

            <p>However, individuals were identified in these records by their 
              slave names as "Pomp," Dinah," "Widow Marselis's Bet," or, even 
              more nebulously, as "the slave of Mr. Ten Eyck." More than a hundred 
              documentary references to slaves "Maria and Tom" over a 120-year 
              period have been found. How many separate lives did these references 
              represent? Probably at least a dozen; possibly as many as a hundred. 
              At the same time, many of those listed once in the record seem to 
              have vanished. For example, while a city assessment roll for 1767 
              taxed the home of Tom Corte "the neger" at one pound, to date a 
              second reference to that individual has not been found. In fact, 
              prior to the 1770's the records so far encountered have not positively 
              identified a single African-ancestry household in any way comparable 
              to even the most modest Euro-American <a href="../homes.html">living 
              units</a>.<a href="#5"><sup><font size=-1>5</font size></sup></a> 
            </p>

<p>Unlike Philadelphia, New York City, and other northern urban centers where free black householders and even neighborhoods appeared during the colonial period, African-American community life did not manifest 
                itself in Albany until after the end of the War for Independence. 
                The additional layer and conditions did not reveal the presence 
                of a free black community in Albany, a <a href="../or/or-3r.html">Revolutionary 
                stronghold</a> where slaves were widely suspected of Seeking to 
                defect to the British in New York City. Consequently, Albany's 
                slaveholders, who included patriots and <a  href="../friends.html"> 
                loyalists</a> alike, sought to keep their bondsmen under tight 
                control, often putting them to work on behalf of Revolutionary 
                enterprises ranging from building to carrying, for which the individual 
                owners were compensated.<a href="#6"><sup><font size=-1>6</font size></sup></a> 
              
<a name=1810></a>
<p>After the war, free blacks were among the new groups that transformed this American city. In 1790, the first federal <a href="../guide/histres.html#1790c">census</a> identified 26 free persons of color living in seven separate city households and a total of 572 slaves among an overall Albany population of 3,498. This census also recorded the high point of slaveholding in Albany, with about a third of the city's homes holding slaves. Albany slaveholders ranged from the 
city's commercial elite to its tradesmen, artisans, and transporters. By 
<a href="../census1800.html">1800</a>, the number of free persons of color in the city had increased to 157 
with 28 predominately African households while the slave population 
still totaled 526. But by 1810-a decade of dramatic change spurred 
by the slave emancipation legislation of 1799, a growing popular 
emancipation movement, the in-migration of free blacks, and the replacement of old Albany families by non slaveowning New 
Englanders and Europeans-free "colored" city residents numbered
501 while the slave population had declined to 251. By 1820, the
last census that recorded slaves, Albany had 645 free people of
color and 108 slaves in an overall city population of almost 13,000.
With the free black population increasing from 501 to 645 between
1810 and 1820, Albany's free black population in 1815 would have
fallen between those figures. The 40 free black householders actually 
identified in Fry's Albany Directory, with at least another eleven
households overlooked in terms of racial composition, meant that
a majority of the city's free black population would have been 
accounted for among those listed in the 1815 edition if they averaged
only four or five members each. During the immediate 
post-Revolutionary era, Albany's free black population multiplied 
with each census (from 26 in 1790 to 1800 to 501 in 1810 and cresting
at 645 in 1820). As the section that follows will show, "free people
of color" (a frequently-used contemporary designation) began to
emerge and establish themselves as a significant element of 
nineteenth-century Albany's social fabric.<a href="#7"><sup><font size=-1>7</font size></sup></a> </p>

<p>Using censuses, assessment rolls, city government records, real-property data, court and probate records, newspaper and the city directories from 1813 on, the Colonial Albany Project has developed biographical profiles for more than a hundred free black residents who meet the criteria for inclusion in the early Albany study population. After their units are reconstructed (identifying spouses and <a href="../children.html">children</a> through family reconstitution), most likely five or six times the number of people visible as heads of households will have been identified. The most well-documented of these minority community members appear to have a number of things in common
which may account for our ability to piece together their lives from the existing pool of historical resources. The Afro-Albanians referred to here and identified as an African-American "middle class" were the most successful of the community's residents of African ancestry. While none of them ranked above the bottom quarter on the overall community economic ladder, they represented success in three ways. They were property owners whose holdings often included several parcels of city land. The were prominent participants in the community-based social and economic activities. And they were the founding members of the Albany families that flourished in the city during the first decades of the nineteenth century. While they are conspicuous by their absence from the known records of early Albany, two graphic manifestations of "Negro" frustration-
the <a href="../fire.html">Fire of 1793</a> in which three slaves were executed for burning a significant portion of the city's central business district, and "<a href="../res/pinkster.html">Pinkster</a>," a traditional springtime bacchanal where blacks were prominently disorderly, are documented.<a href="#8"><sup><font size=-1>8</font size></sup></a> </p>

<p>At the core of the Afro-Albanian middle class were several 
extended family groups. These families became historically visible
during the three decades following the War for Independence and
stepped forward to take advantage of expanded opportunities in
processing and service enterprises, particularly in the area of 
transportation. By 1815, the city directory had identified them as 
significant part of the city's society. The founders of three Albany
families- the Jacksons, the Lattimores, and the Schuylers- were
identified as free people of color in Fry's Albany Directory. The
lives of Jack and Dinah Jackson, Benjamin Lattimore, and Captain
Samuel Schuyler represent significant sectors of the city's free black
community, illustrate important themes in its industrial age, and are
well enough documented to support a closer look.</p>

              <p><a href="../bios/l/blattimore8200.html">Benjamin Lattimore</a> died in 1838 at 
                age 78. He was buried from the newer of the city's two Methodist 
                Episcopal churches and was eulogized in the local papers as a 
                soldier of the American Revolution. Lattimore's life began in 
                Wethersfield Connecticut in 1761. By 1776, his family had moved 
                across the Hudson River to Ulster County where they farmed and 
                ran a ferry. At age fifteen, young Benjamin joined the Revolutionary 
                army. He served in the New York Line for three years, fighting 
                in the battle for New York City, suffering as a prisoner of the 
                British, and in 1779 marching across the state in the Clinton-Sullivan 
                punitive expedition against the Iroquois. During the war, his 
                regiment spent several weeks in Albany. He also made the acquaintance 
                of a number of soldiers who would later become his Albany neighbors. 
                At the end of the war, Benjamin returned to Ulster County but 
                soon decided to leave the family farm. Migration was an important 
                element of the New England experience during the second half of 
                the eighteenth century. Like so many other Yankees who saw opportunity 
                in the west, the Lattimores had moved to New York. But, unlike 
                other sons of New England whose forebears had come to America 
                as part of the Puritan migration of the 1630's. Benjamin Lattimore's 
                ancestors were African.</p>

              <p>Reaching Albany by the 1790s with only the recommendation of meritorious wartime 
                service, this thirty-year old began to support himself as a teamster 
                by purchasing a city license to cart cargoes up and down Albany's 
                hilly and narrow streets and through the city's busy yet muddy 
                boulevards. His ambition found many sponsors in the booming commercial 
                center among those needing goods hauled to and from the docks. 
                Before long, he was ready to set down more permanent roots. Benjamin 
                first lodged with his kinsman, Thomas Lattimore, a tailor then 
                raising his own family in a house on the hill behind one of the 
                city's main streets. In 1798, Benjamin Lattimore purchased a lot 
                west of South Pearl Street in a newly opened area at the foot 
                of "Gallows Hill. There he built his home; ultimately a substantial, 
                two-story brick rowhouse. In the years that followed, he was able 
                to invest extra income in city lots so that his property eventually 
                fronted on <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a>, 
                one of Albany's main thoroughfares. In addition, he brought another 
                lot located farther out on South Pearl Street from the estate 
                of <a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1750.html">General Philip Schuyler</a>.</p> 

<p>Soon after arriving in Albany, Lattimore began to raise a family
and to participate in community activities. First, he found a mate
from among the many women of African-ancestry working in Albany
households. Their son, Benjamin Jr. was born in 1793 and other
children followed. In 1799, this "Negro man" was baptized in the
First Presbyterian Church and was admitted to the congregation.
Five years later, the Presbyterian Church sanctioned his common-law 
marriage to Dina, the "servant maid" of Wilhelmus Mancius, a
prominent city physician. Lattimore was only one of the few "colored" 
male members, while his wife was among a number of 
African-American women who belonged to the Albany Presbyterian 
congregation.</p>
 
<p>By 1815, Lattimore's family and modest trucking business were 
established at his 9 Plain Street address. A few years later, two 
Lattimore families shared the home as Benjamin Jr. had married and 
Was starting out as a day-laborer and sometime teamster. By that time,
Benjamin Sr. was a well-known community figure. In an affidavit
made in 1820, he was described in a judicial proceeding as a six-
foot-tall mulatto man " of irreproachable character and uprightness." 
He was licensed by the city government as a cartman and was a
member of the Presbyterian and then of the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church. During the 1830s he was president of the Albany African 
Temperance Society. Patriarch, proprietor, and property owner,
this "new man of the Revolution" had built a life that made him a
prominent member of post-war Albany's black middle class.</p>

<p>After his death two adult sons and a daughter shared his 
Revolutionary War pension and his other holdings. Benjamin Lattimore
left half of his estate to Benjamin Jr., and a fourth to his other 
surviving son, William. The remaining quarter-share was entrusted to 
Benjamin Jr. for the "personal use" of his sister, the widow Mary
Jackson, thus protecting the bequest from any future husband's
possible mismanagement.</p>

<p>Mainstream history books tell us that in the years following the
American Revolution, Albany's character was transformed by the
energy and ingenuity of newcomers from New England. With a
dramatic rise in the number of free black residents appearing on
community rolls during that time, we expect to be able to identify
some of them from New England town, church, or other records,
and from service records for Revolutionary army. We know 
that Benjamin Lattimore's experience was not unique in Albany
and probably was duplicated many times in other New York communities
as well.<a href="#9"><sup><font size=-1>9</font size></sup></a> </p>
 
              <p>When Benjamin Lattimore moved to Albany, the southern part of the city was 
                a developing area still defined by the elegant Georgian <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">mansion</a> 
                of General Philip Schuyler, Albany's foremost Revolutionary father, 
                great regional landholder, wealthiest man in the community, and, 
                as the master of thirteen slaves on the <a href="../census1790.html#1750">census 
                of 1790</a>, the city's largest slave holder. Schuyler's mansion 
                and outbuildings sat on the crest of a hill that sloped down to 
                the Hudson River and overlooked what once was the city's common 
                pasture lands. At the time of the general's death in 1804, Schuyler 
                mansion commanded a view of dozen of new homes, shops, and utility 
                buildings that constituted a major new development area for the 
                booming new state's capital. After the War for Independence, the 
                Albany city government began selling off South End lots to preferred 
                clients who in turn subdivided and sold or rented these properties 
                to new people who were taking responsibility for a home for the 
                first time.<a href="#10"><sup><font size=-1>10</font size></sup></a></p>

              <p>Running in front of Schuyler Mansion was South Pearl Street. Along that major 
                city thoroughfare at 204 South Pearl was the home of <a href="../bios/s/sschuyler8492.html">Captain 
                Samuel Schuyler</a>, who was listed in Fry's Albany Directory 
                as a "skipper." However, the individual who was often called "Captian" 
                was not the Samuel who was born to Sheriff Harmanus Schuyler and 
                Christina Ten Broeck in 1757 and who lived with family members 
                for more than seventy years. Although Captain Samuel Schuyler 
                became prominent in his own right, the lineage of this particular 
                bearer of the name of Albany's leading family was not among those 
                traceable in the family histories and genealogies that otherwise 
                commemorate the Schuyler family's preeminent position in early 
                Albany society. The reason for the omission was that Captain Samuel 
                Schuyler was black.</p>

            <p>Captain Samuel Schuyler was born in 1781 (probably as a free man 
              and possibly in New York City or New Jersey, where Samuel was a 
              more common Schuyler family name). No surviving records have been 
              found to link this particular Samuel Schuyler to the New Netherland 
              Schuyler's. In the mid twentieth century autobiography entitled 
              <i>Black and Conservative</i>, the African-American writer George 
              Samuel Schuyler wrote that his grandfather had fought in the American 
              Revolution under General Philip Schuyler and was one of the first 
              workers at the federal arsenal at Watervliet which opened in 1813. 
              Could that individual have been Captain Samuel Schuyler's father 
              or uncle? By the early 1800's Samuel was living in Albany where 
              he leased dock space on riverside <a href="../streets.html#Quay">Quay 
              Street.</a> The assessment roll for 1809 described him as a "Blackman." 
              He was also identified as the head of a city household on the third 
              Federal census in 1810. However, his family was represented in terms 
              of free white membership-with a white boy and a girl under ten years 
              old and a white man and a woman between the ages of twenty-six and 
              forty-five. No free blacks or slaves were identified in the Samuel 
              Schuyler household. That peculiar enumeration may be explained by 
              the fact that no city households were listed with African-ancestry 
              heads in 1810. In 1820, and on most other documents, however, Captain 
              Samuel and his family were consistently identified as free people 
              of color.</p>

<p><a name=skipper></a>Like his neighbors of European-ancestry, Captain Schuyler married in his early twenties and raised a large family of eleven children, 
eight of whom lived to adulthood. Initially the operator of
one of the hundreds of small rivercraft that carried cargoes between
Hudson Valley ports and landings on a contract basis, Samuel
Schuyler became well-known in the Albany community and along
the Hudson as a boat captain or skipper. His career represented a 
step forward for Albany's free blacks as several of his contemporaries including John Thompson and Bristol and John Johnson joined him as householders and as river boat proprietors.</p>
 
<p>In 1810, Captain Schuyler purchased an adjoining lot on South
Pearl Street from his neighbor <a href="../bios/m/frmarch.html">Francis March</a>, also a free
black skipper. The captain's first son was named Richard March
Schuyler. Over the next three decades, he was able to acquire most
of the property on South Pearl Street between Bassett and Schuyler
Streets. This Schuyler block was composed of at least fifteen city
lots and was used as a coal yard and warehouse by the captain and
his son, who operated the "Schuyler Tow Boat Line" for several
decades. When Captain Samuel Schuyler died at age sixty-one in
May of 1842, his will provided for the maintenance of his wife, the
former Mary or Margaret Martin or Mortin. After her death the
South Pearl Street house and other real estate passed to his children. 
As successful businessmen, his four sons continued their
father's enterprise into the latter part of the nineteenth century.</p>

              <p>The story of Captain Samuel Schuyler illustrates another issue related to the 
                recovery and reinstatement of the African presence in early Albany 
                society. A number of individuals bearing the surnames of Albany's 
                original settlers, such as the Kips, <a href="../bios/l/lansing.html">Lansings</a> 
                , Van Heusens, and Van Loons, are not to be found on the traditional 
                family trees. A few of these individuals are mentioned in family 
                histories and genealogies, but most of them are not. Because of 
                this exclusion, the historian lacks an important set of resources- 
                the records, accounts, material relics, and traditions passed 
                through generations by family members. To further complicate matters, 
                Captain Samuel Schuyler was identified clearly as "black" or "colored" 
                in a number of records and other documents, but was not listed 
                as a "free person of color" in the 1810 census. What accounts 
                for the inconsistency? Samuel Schuyler's case constitutes a prime, 
                but by no means unique, example of how the status of free blacks 
                was evolving in Albany's urbanizing society. Why did he use the 
                surname "Schuyler"? Did he have a Schuyler parent or ancestor? 
                Was he an emancipated Schuyler family slave? What is most puzzling 
                in his case was that he was not always described as "black" in 
                the record. One implication of this the possibility that some 
                of those individuals in Albany records assumed to be "white," 
                were not. It is also probable that Albany's emerging black community 
                was larger than the so-called official records would have us believe.<a href="#11"><sup><font size=-1>11</font></sup></a> 
              </p>
              <font size=> 
              <p>The lives of Benjamin Lattimore and of Samuel Schuyler stand 
                out among the members of Albany's fledgling free African-American 
                community. Revolutionary War soldier and skipper/proprietor, their 
                success stories are engaging and even uplifting. But how representative 
                were their specific experiences? Were the life histories of these 
                newcomers-recoverable through available church, survey, business, 
                probate, and literary sources-at all typical of those who made 
                up the remainder of the city's large but unarticulated free black 
                population? Because Schuyler and Lattimore were of the first generation 
                of their families in Albany, their histories are comparatively 
                uncomplicated. Their transitions from slavery to freedom was accomplished 
                in preceding generations or at least prior to their first appearance 
                as householders in Albany. Although disadvantaged, they quickly 
                established themselves as fixtures in Albany's social register 
                and they prospered. Charting their lives has been a task only 
                slightly more difficult than researching the lives of their European-ancestry 
                counterparts. However, most free people of color who appear to 
                have lived and died in Albany until the 1800s, remain unaccounted 
                for.</p>
              <p>One approach to this problem is to shift the focus of research 
                to an earlier period when these individuals were slaves. Unfortunately, 
                we have not been very successful in matching the African- ancestry 
                householders listed on the censuses, assessment rolls, directories, 
                or other community records created during the late eighteenth 
                and early nineteenth centuries with the large but much more amorphous 
                collection of references to blacks organized by their first or 
                slave names. But again there are exceptions. A profile of a third 
                Albany family illustrates this problem and may provide more representative 
                example of the emerging African-American middle class.</p>
              <p>An assessment roll taken in March 1779 identified 616 property 
                owners in the city of Albany. A house and lot in the <a href="../wards.html">second 
                ward</a> was valued at 140 pounds and Jack Jackson was listed 
                as the owner. Although Mary Speck and "Mongo" also were identified 
                as householders, the roll made no specific references to their 
                race. Another assessment made that year in October named 620 people 
                as householders and assessed each person an amount ranging from 
                a few dollars for widows, newcomers, and the poor, to between 
                500 and 3,000 dollars for active merchants and those who were 
                being punished for less than enthusiastic support of Revolutionary 
                cause.The October enumeration included two properties listed next 
                to each other in the second ward in the northeastern part of the 
                core city, each assessed at five dollars and identified as the 
                homes of 'Old Jack" and "Young Jack." These were the only first-name-only 
                references on the entire list. If the assessment information is 
                linked with other community records, Old Jack possibly emerges 
                as Jack Jackson and Young Jack as a son. Perhaps Young Jack had 
                come of age between March and October of 1779. Or possibly his 
                property simply had been overlooked on the March assessment. Assuming 
                that the Jack's/Jackson's properties were owned by free residents 
                those two householders could well be from within Albany's African-American 
                population.</p>
              <p>A likely approach was to find free black men with slave names. 
                A check of our slave name reference file revealed twenty "Jacks" 
                who could have been the individuals listed in the 1779 assessment 
                rolls. Some had been recently freed, others belonged to exiled 
                Tories, including the deposed royalist mayor <a href="../bios/c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham 
                C. Cuyler</a>, others were simply referenced as "Jack." We could 
                not identify either of the "Jacks" from this group but neither 
                could we eliminate most of them. Old Jack and Young Jack would 
                have been over twenty years of age in 1779, with Old Jack probably 
                a generation or more older than his namesake. We then searched 
                the extant baptism records of Albany's five eighteenth-century 
                churches. This yielded over a hundred slave and free black baptisms. 
                We found no "Jacks" christened during 1750s or before, but the 
                records revealed that the children of Jack and "Beth" Jackson 
                were being baptized in the Presbyterian church during the 1780s. 
                At each christening, the parents were identified as "negros." 
                Besty Jackson, "a woman of color," was listed as a member and 
                communicant of the First Presbyterian Church in 1806. This raises 
                the question, was Young Jack the "Jack" listed as the father in 
                the records of the 1780s?</p>
              <p>The 1790 federal census listed a "Jack Jackum" whose household 
                included seven "free person of color." Jackum's second ward household 
                was the city's only Jack-named household and also the largest 
                cohabiting family of free blacks to appear in the first federal 
                census. Were two generations of the family living together in 
                the second ward house with Old Jack as the head of the household? 
                During this period, the second ward included city property west 
                and north of North Pearl Street and represented a concentration 
                of "free people of color," with eighteen of Albany's twenty-six 
                free blacks living in that quadrant of the city. The Jackson property 
                on Orange Street was located near the northern city line in an 
                area already referred as "Arbor Hill" and was described on the 
                as- sessment roll for 1799 as a house and lot of modest value 
                and as belonging to Jack" alias John" Jackson.</p>
              <p>The federal census of <a href="../census1800.html">1800</a> listed 
                John Jackson, "a free man," and six other free persons of color 
                as residents of a household in the Arbor Hill section of the second 
                ward. Jack Jackson, a "free negro," and four other free blacks 
                identified in a first ward household located on South Pearl Street 
                near the southern boundary of the city. Had Young Jack set up 
                housekeeping on South Pearl Street? An African-ancestry Jack Jackson 
                lived at that address and worked as a contract laborer for the 
                next two decades. In addition, Abraham Jackson had been assessed 
                as the owner of lots located in the remote part of the first ward. 
                Valued at $140, his South End lot equaled the lowest assessment 
                applied to any city real estate. His personal property valued 
                at three dollars was the smallest amount specified on the entire 
                citywide tax list. The assessment of personal property as well 
                as real estate meant that the location, even though no building 
                was noted, was Abraham Jackson's place of residence. Was he living 
                in a tent, a shed or another makeshift structure? In 1800, 14 
                free persons of color (or almost 10 per cent of the city's free 
                black population of 157) were living in three Jackson-named households 
                near the northern and southern borders of the city of Albany.</p>
              <p>An important element of the city's black Jackson configuration 
                had changed by the time assessors made out the tax roll for 1802. 
                That document specified two second ward parcels of land (the <a href="../streets.html#orange">Orange 
                Street</a> house and a nearby lot) listed as being owned by "Dian" 
                or <a href="../bios/j/djackson1074.html">Dinnah Jackson</a>. For 
                the Orange Street house and lot, her name had been inserted above 
                the name of Jack Jackson, which had been crossed out. Jack Jackson, 
                probably formerly known as "Old Jack," apparently had died and 
                his widow, Dinnah, had become head of the household. Dinnah had 
                extensive experience in the administra- tion of real estate. In 
                1779, Dinnah Jackson, "a free negro woman," purchased a lot north 
                of the city from an aging Wihelmus Van Antwerpen, making her Albany's 
                first recorded African-ancestry property owner. By 1814, she had 
                moved a few blocks closer to Albany's residential core, to 31 
                Maiden Lane, a back street that was home to a number of free black 
                families. A few years later, she gave up her home and spent her 
                final years with one of her grand- daughters. She had already 
                applied some of her assets to the purchase of seven lots on <a href="../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor 
                Hill</a> in the northwestern corner of the city. She bequeathed 
                this property and her personal property and savings to her six 
                grandchildren, because by the time she made her will in June 1818 
                she had outlived all her children. She died a few months later.</p>
              <p>Two Jacksons did establish themselves, and each raised families 
                in Albany's <a href="../bios/s/sschuyler8492.html#southend">South 
                End</a>. Before 1800, Abraham Jackson had married Diana, the former 
                slave of a city merchant, and had taken up residence on his own 
                property on Bassett Street. By 1809, he was renting dock space 
                on Quay Street where he could barter and peddle produce and goods 
                while also earning additional income loading and unloading cargoes 
                and helping out the boatman and ferryman, many of whom were also 
                identified in the city directory as "free people of color." All 
                three of his Bassett Street neighbors - Bristol or Bristow Johnson, 
                John Johnson, and Patrick Cole - were free black watermen and 
                were listed in the city directory. Jack Jackson was raising his 
                family around the corner from Bassett Street on South Pearl, a 
                few doors away from the home of Captain Samuel Schuyler and in 
                the same neighborhood as a number of other <a href="../map/blackhouseholds1815.html">free 
                black households</a>. At the same time, two were living on the 
                north side of the city.<a href="#12"><sup><font size=-1>12</font size></sup></a> 
              </p>
              <p>Although these sons died or left the city by 1820, the city directory 
                for that year identified fourteen other Jackson households as 
                free people of color. Some of these descendants of Dianna Jackson 
                shared in the Arbor Hill houselots listed in her will. Others 
                were able to acquire land in the South End. Each of these enclaves 
                survived a number of historical pressures and the descendants 
                of Old Jack and Dinnah helped form the backbone of African-American 
                community life in downtown Albany that remained vital until after 
                the Civil War.<a href="#13"><sup><font size=-1>13</font></sup></a> 
              </p>
              <p>The Jacksons stood out as an African-American family group in 
                the city directory of 1815, but they were not alone. Even then, 
                the presence of the black Johnsons, Jenkinses, and Thompsons was 
                marked by multiple households. Other black Albany families also 
                evolved from those emerging during the era of the <a href="../or/or.html">American 
                Revolution</a>. Their stories have become a part of any depiction 
                of mainstream community life in early Albany. However, the question 
                of how representative were these members of the Afro-Albanian 
                middle class of the overall black experience is still without 
                resolution. Admittedly we have studied Albany's African Americans 
                from the top down. The lives of Benjamin Lattimore, Captain Samuel 
                Schuyler, and Jack and Dinnah Jackson represent the success of 
                the black post-Revolutionary experiences. The stories of the other 
                98 percent of Albany's African-ancestry population are still obscure. 
                Despite these shortcomings, the family profiles presented above 
                and the more general discussion of problems and approaches to 
                African-American community history have addressed an important, 
                yet still not understood, element of the community-building experience 
                in the New York State.</p>

                inventories have contributed the most information on slavery in 
                early Albany: See <i>A Community History Project</i> under the 
                heading of "Probate Records." The records and accounts of the 
                city business people contain many references to work done by slaves 
                and to the costs of their maintenance. General literary sources, 
                particularly personal papers and travelers' accounts, represent 
                a major resource not yet investigated by the Colonial Albany Project. 
                See the section in <i>A Community History Project</i> on "Historical 
                Resources" for a comprehensive explanation. Albany census figures 
                for 1714 are printed in <i>The Documentary History of the State

                Population of the British Colonies in America before 1776</i> 
                (Princeton, 1975), 111-15. The provincial census of 1714 (the 
                only colonial enumeration of the city's slave population, as distinct 
                from the larger county) counted 41 males and 66 females (a total 
                of 107 slaves) out of an overall city population of 1,237. More

                Most individuals of European ancestry being studied by the Colonial 
                Albany Project are identifiable as members obvious family groups 
                and from the backbone of the community biography data base. Individual 
                references to Afro-Albanians are archived in two additional holding 
                files. The first is a large alphabetical file of references under 
                first names/slaves names. These have been recovered from virtually 
                all sources encountered, date from 1660s to the first decades 
                of the nineteenth century, and identify individuals as slaves, 
                negroes, or servants. A second holding file contains surname and 
                often first name references to individuals identified in historical 
                records or literary sources who may meet the requirements for 
                inclusion, in the overall study population and who have been identified 
                as of African ancestry (e.g. blacks, colored, Negro, a wench). 
                Most of these references are from the period after the War for 
                Independence. While still a holding device, the surname file contains 
                materials on several hundred individuals in many cases combining 
                information from more than a single source.</p>

              <p><a name=7><sup>7</sup></a> The federal census of the city of 
                Albany for 1790 and 1800 identified principal "free person of 
                color" as householders and aggregated the number of people in 
                each household in a single category. Slaves were not named at 
                all but were counted together in a separate section within the 
                households of their owners. The 1790 census also included (but 
                not by name) four free blacks in four predominantly white city 
                households, thus revealing that free status for blacks had not 
                yet taken hold in Albany. The 1800 census identified 114 individuals 
                living in twenty-eight free black households - 11 by surnames, 
                17 by slave names. Another 43 free blacks lived in predominantly 
                white households. In 1800, free and slave still were confined 
                to single census categories. But the 1810 census represented a 
                backward step in that it identified no free black-headed households 
                by name, instead lumping the "all other free persons" into the 
                household of what appears to be their closest European ancestry 
                neighbor. By the 1820 census, "free Blacks" were accounted for 
                by gender and age in the households of a named head of household 
                whether he or she was white or black. Slaves also were aggregated 
                by gender and age and included within the households of their 
                owners. </p>

                two members of the "Black" Jackson family. They are Abraham Jackson 
                (ca. 1770 ca.-1816) case 413, and Dinnah Jackson (ca.1740-1818) 
                case1142. Her will and supporting documents are filed at the Albany 
                County Surrogate's office. The files of "John and "Jack" Jackson 
                information held by the project are massive but still defy responsible 
                assignment. Additional Jackson family members (ultimately accounting 
                for as many as fifty people) will be added to the database as 
                soon as possible.</p>
              <p><a name=13><sup>13</sup></a> The federal census for 1820 enumerated 
                the following Jackson households within the city of Albany. The 
                number of "free people of color" in each living unit is noted 
                in parenthesis: Betsey Jackson (5); Nancy Jackson (6); Henry Jackson 
                (3); John Jackson (6); Jacob Jackson (3); Peter Jackson (3); Joseph 
                Jackson (8); James Jackson (2); John Jackson (3); John Jackson 
                (2); Francis Jackson (5); Richard Jackson (3); John Jackson (2); 
                Nailer Jackson (2); Robert Jackson (4). No slaves were counted 
                in any of these households. The 1820 city directory listed the 
                following Jackson households and noted that the head of household 
                was a free person of color: Francis Jackson, 51 Fox; Richard Jackson, 
                ferryman, 645 S. Market; Margaret Jackson, 63 Division; John Jackson, 
                musician, 35 Union; Widow Nancy Jackson, Prescot; Abraham Jackson, 
                Prescot; Widow Mariah Jackson, Herkimer; Joseph Jackson, 10 Lydius; 
                Sylvester Jackson, laborer, 73 S. Pearl; James Jackson, laborer, 
                41 Division; John T. Jackson, victuller, 22 Washington; Charles 
                Jackson, laborer, 86 Fox; Peter Jackson, barber, 511 Market; and 
                Jacob Jackson, Laborer, 16 Quay.</p>
