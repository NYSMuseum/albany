<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; However, this piece of community iconography provides a number of windows on the city's socioeconomic fabric at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. By listing and grouping the Albany participants according to their political, social, and/or economic identities we might consider and/or appreciate a number of community-based dynamics. The entire document has been <a href="../res/trans.html">transformed</a> and is presented here for convenience and accessibility.</blockquote></blockquote></font size>

The counties of New York, Westchester, Kings, and Richmond gave 19 federal. The counties ol Queens sending 9, was divided. The whole number of delegates sent was 67.

<p>The city of Albany, not to be behind her sister cities in patriotic display, set apart the 8th of August as a day of public rejoicings, to Celebrate the ratification of the constitution of the United States by the Convention of the state of New York Almost every trade and profession seems to have united in the jubilee, with appropriate emblems, and formed a truly imposing procession, notwithstanding the preponderance of the anti-federal party at the polls. A page of the <a href="../ag.html"><i>Gazette</i></a> of August 28, is occupied with the proceedings, as follows:

<p>[printed passage continuing the discussion that has not been usefully transformed]

<p>The procession moved with the greatest regularity through Watervliet, Market, (now Broadway) and State street, to the Federal "Bower" [as printed] which the van reached at half past twelve o'clock, announced by the firing of a gun.

<p>This edifice made an highly elegant appearance. It was erected on a most advantageous part of the heights west of <a href="../loc/fortalbany.html">Fort Frederick</a>; commanding the most extended prospect of any situation near the city; and when the flags of the respective divisions were displayed on its battlements, that of the United States in the centre, that of the State on the right, and the farmers on the left, the coup p'wil [eye] was extremely pleasing. The edifice was 154 feet in length and 44 in breadth, and was raised on 4 rows of pillars, 15 feet in height, which were close wreathed with foliage and composed of 11 arches in front From the architrave, which was clothed with verdant branches, festoons of foliage were suspended, which crossed the arches; above the centre of which, were white oval medallions, with the name of a ratifying state on each.

<p>When the procession had drawn up in a line, at the rear of the bower, the company marched off, in regular divisions, to the tables, which were plentifully covered with substantial American cheer; handsomely arranged under the direction of Mr. Wm. Van Ingen. And the tables, which were eleven in number, placed across the collonade, in a line with the arches, were by no means sufficient for the company. After dinner, the following toasts were drank, each honored with the discharge of eleven guns:


<p><div align="center"><a href="#lithgow"><img src="../images/modern/lithgowratif1788.jpg" width=600 height= border=2 alt="Lithgow 1788"></a></div>

<p>[335] 
<p>It may he mentioned, by way of episode, that when the procession reached <a href="../streets.html#green">Green street</a>, a party oT anti federalists, as they were then called, who had collected there, made an assault upon it, and a skirmish ensued. One of the principal actors in the scene was the late <a href="../bios/k/jokid5989.html">Mr. Jonathan Kidney</a>. A cannon had been procured, and heavily charged; and the excitement was so great, that it would undoubtedly have been discharged upon the line of procession, had not Mr. Kidney prevented it by driving the end of a file into the fuse, and breaking it off. The lighthorse made a charge upon the assailants, who scampered out of the way. The projecting oven of the old Stone House was torn down to furnish missiles. Among the wounded on the occasion was <a href="../bios/c/jacaldwell7509.html">Mr. James Caldwell</a>, who received a brick upon his forehead.,</p>
