      <p>Three considerable streams of water, which anciently traversed the <a href="../earlycity.html">city</a>, 
        have within the memory of many inhabitants, been converted into sewers, 
        namely, the <a href="../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxen kill</a>, the <a href="../loc/ruttenkill.html">Rutten 
        kill</a>, and the <a href="../loc/beaverkill.html">Bever kill</a>. 
      <p>The Foxen kill, when the city was first settled, and for a long time 
        after, afforded abundance of fish. It ran outside of the stockades, which 
        for a great many years formed the northern <a href="../citylimits.html">boundary</a> 
        of the city. It is but little more than a quarter of a century since it 
        was crossed by a <a href="../im/imepearlchurch.html">bridge</a> in <a href="../streets.html#pearl">North 
        Pearl</a> street, near Orange. 
      <p>The Rutten kill was a lesser stream, having its <a href="../map/mapdewitt.html">source</a> 
        above Lark street, but which sent down a formidable volume of water in 
        times of freshet. The inhabitants of the upper end of <a href="../streets.html#beaver">Beaver</a> 
        street, have an inkling of what it may have been when they are refreshed 
        by a heavy rain storm. This also was a never-failing brook, stored with 
        fish, and was the only one that came within the old city walls. Passing 
        down the <a href="../streets.html#hudson">Hudson street</a> ravine, it 
        crossed Pearl street where the Congregational church stands, and entered 
        the river a few feet <a href="../loc/court.html">below</a> State street. 
        In the oldest map of the city, <a href="../map/map1676.html">1676</a> 
        (see Annals Albany, vol. <a href="http://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/200/mode/2up">iv., 
        p. 200</a>), a brug marks the spot where it crossed the street now called 
        Broadway. The city records frequently allude to these bridges. In January, 
        1701, we find the following entry: 
      <p>"It is further concluded since ye Bridge by <a href="../bios/s/pischuyler61.html">Coll. 
        Schuyler</a>'s doth decay, that Mr. Roseboom, Hendrick Oothout and Harpert 
        Jacobse vizite ye same, and make returne ye next court what is required 
        to be repaired." 
      <p>A meeting was held on the next day, when the following report was made: 
      <blockquote>"Relating ye Bridge at Coll. Schuyler's, ye gentlemen yesterday 
        appointed to vizite ye same, doe return that it requires to be repaired 
        with one oak log, of 17 foot, 12 inches square; four posts, 10 foot, 10 
        inches square; two pine loggs often foot, 1 foot square; three ditto, 
        17 foot apiece; three ditto of 20 foot; and one of 37 foot."</blockquote>
      <p>In 1706 the following entry was made in the common council minutes, relating 
        to another of these bridges: "The petition of <a href="../bios/h/wmhogan4396.html">William 
        Hogan</a> relating ye bridge by ye Lutheran Church being much out of repair 
        desyreing that ye Common Council will take ye same into their wise consideration 
        yt ye Bridge be repaired. It is "Resolved that in convenient time ye same 
        shall be made sufficient to passe and repasse without danger." 
      <p>The <a href="../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> alluded to occupied 
        the ground of the Market house in South Pearl street, and its burial ground 
        was the site of Ihe vegetable market adjoining. Pearl street, for a century 
        after this, was but a lane, many persons now living remembering when a 
        gate swung across it at State street. 
      <p>On the 13th April, 1706, the following record was made in the common 
        council minutes: "As to ye Bridge towards ye Lutheran church, <a href="../bios/h/hehansen4939.html">Mr. 
        Hansen</a> is agreed to make a sufficient and strong new bridge, laid 
        with good plank two inches thick, wherefore he is to receive ye £5:10 
        due from Evert Janse." 
      <p>Two years later we find the following entry: "The Commonalty being informed 
        yt ye Bridge over ye Rutten kill in ye street lately known by ye name 
        of ye ffuddamart <a href="#*"> * </a> is very much out of repair & decade, 
        doe therefore order yt ye sd Bridge shall be made anew and yt Mr. Robt 
        Livingston & Coenradt Ten Eyk are appointed to see ye sd Bridge made upon 
        ye Citty charges." 
      <p>September 28. This day Mr. <a href="../bios/l/rlivingstonjr.html">Robert 
        Livingston Jun</a> & <a href="../bios/t/cote4812.html">Conraet ten Eyk</a> 
        brought in their acct of makeing of ye Bridge over ye Rutten kill in ye 
        street calld ye fodde mart, amounting in all after £2:9: is deducted, 
        wh is payd to them £1:14: 4£ wh[ich] is approved of by ye Commonalty & 
        orderd yt those persons are to have credt in ye Citty book for what there 
        is due to them." 
      <p>Whether the name of this creek is derived from rats, as some suppose, 
        it is infested with myriads of the lustiest specimens of that vermin to 
        this day. The creek is now a sewer throughout its entire length. The grading 
        of the ravine which it traversed was nearly complete in 1847, from Hawk 
        to Lark street, and from <a href="../streets.html#lydius">Lydius</a> to 
        State. So late as 1827 it was an unbroken waste. Eagle street then extended 
        no farther than the Lancaster School, now the Medical College. There was 
        not a dozen buildings even on Lydius street, from Pearl to Lark. When 
        the unfortunate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_at_Cherry_Hill">Strang</a> 
        was executed in its grassy valley in the above mentioned year, its green 
        hills on either side were darkened by a multitude numbering full thirty 
        thousand. The clay banks on Lydius street furnished the city with <a href="../trades/brickstone.html">bricks</a> 
        for a great number of years. During a period of about three years two 
        hundred and fifty men and sixty teams were employed upon the work of grading 
        and filling this large area. The ravine, three hundred feet broad and 
        fifty feet deep, received the lofty banks upon its borders, and was raised 
        to a convenient grade, whereby a large tract was reclaimed for habitation, 
        that had been useless except for brick kilns, or basins where water gathered, 
        furnishing reservoirs for bathing and fishing to truant boys. Not less 
        than six hundred thousand yards excavation was made in blue clay, and 
        an equal amount of filling was done by one contractor. By this improvement 
        Hudson street has become the most inviting avenue to the city, and comely 
        blocks of dwellings already adorn most of the streets which intersect 
        the area of the ancient Rutten kill.</p>
