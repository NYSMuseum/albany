<p><b>T</b>his image lets everyone know that a particular page on the <a href="welcome.html"><i>People of Colonial Albany Live Here Website</i></a> is undergoing revision, redevelopment, or restructuring. "Men at Work" - you know!</p>

<p>Because this website is <a href="newfeatures.html">evolving rapidly</a> and on many interdependent fronts, we must move forward with partially perfected features on almost every complex page. The material appearing on a particular "in-progress" page represents a direction we plan to follow with each topic, theme, or character. We plan for the size of each "in-progress" icon on a page to represent how much more information we might expect to uncover on a particular person or subject!

        <p>Please understand that every page represents a good-faith effort on our part 
          to provide the most accurate and sound information on any relevant subject. 
          At some point, we hope that "someday" our offerings will be the most 
          comprehensive and accessible statements on each topic. However, we are 
          not perfect! Every day we <a href="res/qcq.html">correct</a> a number 
          of presentation errors, rewrite problem passages, and clean up grammar, 
          usage, punctuations, and spelling mistakes. We are grateful for the 
          correctives and suggestions that we receive every day. We always appreciate 
          hearing from you! 
        <p>We appreciate your patience. We invite you to check these pages often and let us know what you think. Please remember that each offering is undergoing constant revision. The dates on the bottom of each page relate to the conception, public debut, and ongoing revision of every item.</p>

<p>In the meantime, please consider some of the <a href="newfeatures.html">recently opened pages</a> devoted to <a href="gallery.html"><i>The People of Colonial Albany and Their World</i></a>!<br>
