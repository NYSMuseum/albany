size=-1>Publications are the most utilitarian and traditional means of telling 
the story. Most of the items that follow represent first fruits of our long-term and comprehensive research program aimed at reconstructing the pre-industrial community by understanding the story and contributions of each of the 16,000 different people who lived in the city of Albany before the Industrial Revolution. These research-based expositions address important historical themes and community issues. The other items explain our approach as community historians and/or provide leads to additional historical resources. These works are recommended as starting points for the work of the <I><A href="whoarewe.html">Colonial Albany 
Project</A></I> and can be ordered by contacting the project by any of the means <a href="#contacts">listed below</a>.

<p><blockquote><b>However</b>, all of the works that follow have been eclipsed by historical expositions and resources featured on <a href="index.html"><i>The People of Colonial Albany Live Here Website</i></a>. In fact, by the year 2000, we no longer were committing new energy to the production of "paper based" publications and other offerings. Truly, history fans, you can do much better from us in every way via the website. That said, some of the works that follow have been <a href="pcalhindex.html#articles">transformed</a> into web-based expositions as individually noted. Most of them have been "improved" in the process.</blockquote> </font size>
