          <p>Located west of the Hudson River and immediately south of the <a href="../earlycity.html">city 
            of Albany</a>, Bethlehem was established as a separate town in <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany 
            County</a> on March 12, 1793. Before that, it was technically part of the town of <a href="watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. Before that, the area was considered part of the "west manor." Prior to the 1760s, it was a larger portion of <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. The name has 
            several <a href="../res/ts.html">folk origins </a>and was used as early as the <a href="#name">seventeenth           century</a>.</p>
			
          <p>The first <a ahref="../nnd.html">Dutch</a> settlement was made within the future boundaries 
            of Bethlehem at the mouth of the <a href="#nrmskl">Normanskill</a> 
            on <a href="castle.html">Castle Island</a> in 1614.</p>
<p><a name=nmskl></a>Permanent settlement began during the 1630s when the <a href="../bios/vr/vr.html">Van Rensselaers</a> leased out farms near the river and along the Normanskill and other streams that flowed into the Hudson. <a href="../bios/b/bradt.html"><img src="../images/jpg/ltbradtmill.jpg" align=right alt="Bradt mill on the Normanskill" hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 width=150></a> Sawmills were built along these waterways. The <a href="../bios/b/bradt.html">Bradts</a>, <a href="../bios/l/omlg5927.html">La Granges</a>, <a href="../bios/w/winne.html">Winnes</a>, <a href="../bios/vw/vwie.html">Van Wies</a>, 
            and other <a href="../nnfamilies.html">New Netherland</a> ancestry 
            <a href="../familynames.html">early Albany families</a> were among 
            the first farmers of the part of Rensselaerswyck known as <a href="#name">Bethlehem</a>. 
            After 1750, they were joined by <a href="../bios/irish.html">Sc</a>ottish &eacute;migr&eacute;s who 
            also accepted Van Rensselaer leaseholds and lived in the western part 
            of the town called "New Scotland."</p>
<p>The so-called <a href="../im/im1767.html">Bleecker Map</a> of 1767 locates a number of the residences along the river. At that time, most of not all of the residents were at least nominally tenants of the <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>.

<p>Although a number of substantial homes were built in Bethlehem during the eighteenth century, <a href="#sources">town development</a> effectively began with the end of the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a> when mills and factories began to take advantage the town's abundant water and forest resources. More elegant country seats were built on the hills overlooking the river. In <a href="http://www.censusrecords.com/search?state=new york&citytownship=bethlehem&recordset=us census 1800">1800</a>, the first year the town had a dedicated census, its population was 3,723. By 1820, Bethlehem's population had reached 5,114 and still was primarily agricultural.</P>

<p>Bethlehem was connected to Albany by a <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">river 
            road</a> and by the Delaware Turnpike.</p>
          <p>Bethlehem's initial 6,440 acres have been diminished by the separation 
            of New Scotland in 1832 and the ceding of "Groesbeckville" to the 
            city of Albany in 1874. A final adjustment with Albany and Guilderland 
            was made in 1967. <a name=nrmskl></a>
          <p> <a href="#norman"><img src="../images/modern/normanskill.jpg" align=left border=1 alt="farm on the Normanskill" width=200vspace=4 hspace=4></a>Bethlehem's 
            <a href="../citylimits.html">border with Albany</a> today is "the 
            Normanskill" - a long and permanent stream that <a href="../im/im1767.html#west">winds</a> 
            for many miles across south-central Albany County and empties into 
            the Hudson River after flowing around the west side of Castle Island. 
            Cutting deeply into the countryside, its many vales have been utilized 
            by <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+normanskill+history">members</a> 
            of a number of early Albany <a href="../familynames.html">families</a> 
            for <a href="../bios/b/bradt.html">milling</a> and farming since the 
            beginnings of settlement. During the latter part of the eighteenth-century, 
            Albany merchant <a href="../bios/g/joglen4934.html">John Glen, Jr.</a> 
            bought up several tracts of Normanskill bottomland.</p>

            others (Bethlehem Bicentennial Commission, 1993). A range of early
