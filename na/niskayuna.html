<p><a href="#sources">Niskayuna</a> (<a href="../res/sp.html">co</a>rrupted from Native language "Canistigone" possibly meaning "corn flats") has evolved from a <a href="../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional term referring to the southern flats of the Mohawk River - located east of <a href="schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and north of the Manor of <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. This information page presents elements of that  story in their city of Albany <a href="../criteria.html">context</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#sauth"><img src="../images/jpg/na/nisksauthier.jpg" align=left border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=250></a>Located beyond the jurisdiction of the Van Rensselaers, New Netherland-era farmers first occupied the bottomlands during the 1660s. A translated <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~windmill/html/rolldeed.html">transcription</a> of the "original" deed from 1661 has been preserved among some family papers. Some of the settlers, including <a href="../bios/c/janclute.html">Jan Clute</a> and <a href="../bios/vv/rycvvranken6474.html">Ryckert Claese Van Vranken</a> and his son, <a href="../bios/vv/mrvvranken6475.html">Maas Ryckse</a>, were or became residents of Albany. <a href="../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer Captain Marte Cregier and/or his same-named <a href="../bios/c/macregier5312.html">son</a>  were prominent residents of Canastigione. Albany resident <a href="../bios/s/gespoor6527.html">Gerrit Spoor</a> and his siblings grew up on their <a href="../bios/s/janspoor.html">father</a>'s Niskayuna farm.

<p>Traditional sources also say that in 1667 the Mohawks gave five islands in the river there to <a href="../bios/vs/hivslyck.html">Hilletie Van Slyck Van Olinda</a> as payment for her services  as interpreter.

<p>A military <a href="http://www.dmna.state.ny.us/forts/fortsM_P/niskayunaFort.htm">outpost</a> presently known as "Fort Niskayuna" was mentioned as early as 1691.

<p>Jan Spoor <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yZNQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=jan+wiebese&source=bl&ots=-0x8FWJyy8&sig=BDPduixE6CXguG5QfKWpmHRzlsc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bn13UrjUOLLlsATpxoGQBA&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw">sold</a> his 'manured and cultivated' land at "Canastigone" to <a href="../bios/s/joschuyler100.html">Johannes Schuyler</a> in 1698.

<p>A so-called "Niskayuna Patent" was granted to what would become the Niskayuna <a href="http://www.niskayunareformed.org">">Dutch church</a> in 1738. It was to encompass 2,500 acres, was located "east and south of the Schenectady patent and extended from the Ael-plaats south to the north line of the manor of Rensselaerswyck." The actual  church plot was much smaller. Church services in Niskayuna appear to have dated from the 1750s.

<p>Variously spelled, Niskayuna was located on most <a href="../im/im1757.html">contemporary maps</a>. It was connected to Albany by a rudimentary <a href="../loc/kingshighway.html">wagon road</a>. Settlement in the area has been charted on the Bleecker <a href="../im/im1767.html#west">map of 1767</a>.

<p><a name=shakers></a>About 1776, Ann Lee's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakers">Shakers</a> settled in the area near today's Albany Airport. They cleared the land  and erected a meeting house as early as 1784. In <a href="../census1790.html#shaker">1790</a>, David Meacham and Hezekiah Noble were prominent in the Niskayuna Shaker 
          community which mostly was referred to as <a href="watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.</p>

        <p>Originally part of old <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>, Niskayuna 
          then was a part of the town of <a href="watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> 
          and in 1809 was erected into a separate town within newly formed Schenectady County. The bridge across the Mohawk at Rexford was <a href="http://minerva.union.edu/garverj/mohawk/bridge_mohawk.html">built</a> about 1805.</p>

<P><a name=sources></a>Here are some 
<a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/citycounty.html#nis">links</a> to <b>sources</b> for Niskayuna's early history. Here is a <a href="http://www.niskayuna.org/Public_Documents/NiskayunaNY_Historian/history2">narrative</a> and <a href="http://www.niskayuna.org/Public_Documents/NiskayunaNY_Historian/chrono">basic chronology</a>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niskayuna,_New_York">Wikipedia</a> summary. <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/niskayuna/">Link</a> to directory of online historical resources.

<p>In this exposition, we are not attempting to come to terms with land title questions but rather to describe the "Niskayuna" part of the <a href="../res/realestate.html">holdings</a> of some early Albany residents.

<p><a name=sauth></a>Detail from an engraving of the so-called <a href="../im/imsauthier.html">Sauthier Map</a> dated 1776. Copied and adapted from an <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/map_item.pl?data=/home/www/data/gmd/gmd380/g3800/g3800/ar104703.jp2&itemLink=r?ammem/gmd:@field(NUMBER+@band(g3800+ar104703))&title=A+map+of+the+Province+of+New-York,+reduc%26%2339;d+from+the+large+drawing+of+that+Province,+compiled+from+actual+surveys+by+order+of+His+Excellency+William+Tryon,+Esqr.+Captain+General+%26+Governor+of+the+same,+by+Claude+Joseph+Sauthier;+to+which+is+added+New-Jersey,+from+the+topographical+observations+of+C.+J.+Sauthier+and+B.+Ratzer.+Engraved+by+William+Faden+...+1776.&style=gmd&legend=">online resource</a>. This image is <a href="../inprog.html">not satisfactory</a> nor adequate for many reasons but it does locate Niskayuna on the 18th century Mohawk River landscape. A detail from the northern edge of <a href="../im/im1767.html">Bleecker Map</a> of 1767 which locates individual farms might be more useful.</p>
