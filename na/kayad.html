This part of old <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> originally was patented between 1703 and 1708. But title was not confirmed until 1768 and the lands were surveyed and partitioned in 1771. <a href="http://www.townofmiltonny.org/milton-history.asp">Settlement</a> dates to about 1772!</p>

<p>The thirteen original petitioners included the Attorney General, important New Yorkers, Albany residents <a href="../bios/v/navisscher4160.html">Nanning H. Visscher</a> and <a href="../bios/b/jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Beekman</a>, and Albany native <a href="../bios/vd/rvd6353.html">Rip Van Dam</a> - then a Manhattan businnessman and member of the governor's Council.</p> 

<p>Contemporaries argued that the grant encompassed the lands north of the Mohawk and West of the Hudson - a huge chunk of frontier real estate. The patent ultimately encompassed more than 250,000 acres of land. <a href="../bios/j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a> is credited for having that acreage reduced to 23,000 acres in 1760.</p>

<p>The pending patent was an issue that required special meetings at the <a href="../albanycongress.html">Albany Congress</a> in 1754.</p>


<p>A number of early Albany families (including the <a href="../bios/g/glen.html">Glens</a>) shared in the complicated partition of this patent! Albany merchant <a href="../bios/v/siveeder6776.html">Simon J. Veeder</a> was able to acquire sixteen lots in 28 transactions during 1771.
<p>An Indian name, many spellings are encountered in the historical record and today!</p>
