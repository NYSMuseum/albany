<p>Variously called Castle Island, Martin Gerritse's Island, Patroon's Island, and Westerlo Island, the large landform on the west side of the Hudson River was separated from the mainland by the passage of the Normanskill (<a href="../res/sp.html">so</a>metimes called the "Normanskill Creek") behind it as it wound its way into the Hudson. </p>

<p><a href="#trading"><img src="../images/fortnassau.jpg" width=150 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 alt="trading post on Castle Island"></a>The island has a rich history and many traditions! Inhabited by both Mohawk and <a href="#dunn">Mohicans</a>, it was said to be the site of a French trading post built during the sixteenth century. The first documented inhabitation probably occurred in 1614 when a trading outpost known as Fort Nassau was erected by the Dutch West India Company. Located on the Hudson River flood plain, the rudimentary "fort" was washed away by flooding in 1617.</p>

          <p>Fort Nassau was replaced by the building of <a href="../loc/fortorange.html">Fort 
            Orange</a> in 1624. By the 1640s, the fertile island was divided into farms and leased 
            to tenants. 
            The first farm on Castle Island was called "Rensselaersburgh" and 
            was established in 1630.</p> 

<p>Early <a href="#tenants">tenants</a> included Brant Peelen, Adrian Vanderdonck, <a href="#segerse">Cornelis Segerse</a>, and <a href="../bios/vb/mgvb6656.html">Marte Gerritse Van Bergen</a>.<a href="#castle"><img src="../images/jpg/ltcastle2.jpg" width=200 align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Castle Island - 1645"></a></p>

<P>Marte Gerritse held a lease on the island from before 1664 until about 1690. During that time, it was among the most productive farms in Rensselaerswyck. Gerritse tried to purchase the island but was rebuffed by the Van Rensselaers and finally was displaced and replaced by members of the <a href="../bios/s/staats.html">Staats</a> family.</p> 

<p>The Albany <a href="../charter.html">city charter</a> of 1686 fixed Albany's southeastern boundary as the "tip of Marte Gerritse's island."</p>
 
<p>Throughout the balance of the colonial period, the island was included in the manor of <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and was leased to a succession of advantaged area residents. In <a href="#1744">1744</a>, <a href="../bios/m/jomilne.html">John Milne</a>, former rector of <a href="../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> Anglican church, was its resident farmer. <a href="#1767"><img src="../images/map1767albany.jpg" width=300 hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 align=left alt="Patroon's Island - 1767"></a> 
            Then, British retainer <a href="../bios/h/hiholland.html">Hitchen 
            Holland</a> held the lease until his death in 1762. In 1767, it was 
            called "Patroon's Island" and was leased to <a href="../bios/b/jobradstreet.html">John 
            Bradstreet</a>. On patroon <a href="../bios/vr/svr5114.html">Stephen 
            Van Rensselaer's</a> death in 1769, the island passed to his widow, 
            <a href="../bios/l/calivingston5034.html">Catherine Livingston Van 
            Rensselaer</a>. Perhaps it was known as "Westerlo Island" because 
            the patroon's widow married Dominie <a href="../bios/w/ewesterlo.html">Eilardus 
            Westerlo</a> in 1775.</p>

<p>By the 1880s, the island had about 160 acres of "fertile land . . producing fine crops in favorable seasons." It also had two ironworks on its northern end. At that time, it belonged to the town of <a href="bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>.</p>

<p>From 1909 to 1927/8, the island was used as an airfield called "Quenton Roosevelt Field." Famed aviators Glenn Curtis and Charles A. Lindbergh landed on the airstrip - the predecessor of the <a href="http://www.albanyairport.com/3/kids/airport.html">Albany Airport</a>.</p>

<p>New York State created the Albany Port District in 1931 which encompassed 200 acres (including the island) within the city of Albany and another 35 acres across the river in Rensselaer. Dredging and construction followed. In 1932, the island had been transformed and officially opened as the <a href="#port">Port of Albany</a>.

In 1646, he took over from Adrian Vanderdonck the other farm for the remaining 3 years of its lease, and thus came into possession of the entire island. In 1651, an inventory of the farm of Cornelis Segers showed that he was the owner of 13 horses and 22 cows, and that the farm contained 70 morgens, and the rent was 1210 guilders. This farm was called Welysburgh.</p>
