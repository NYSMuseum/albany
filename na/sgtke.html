<p><b><a href="../earlycity.html">A</a></b>lbany was granted a 500 acre tract of land at "<a href="#biblio">Schaghticoke</a>" in its municipal <a href="../charter.html">charter</a> of 1686. Initially, the Albany <a href="../cityfathers.html">government</a> did not follow up on its obligation to purchase the <a href="../res/realestate.html">land</a> from the Schaghticoke Indians. Instead, in 1698 <a href="../bios/vr/hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a> was authorized to obtain an Indian deed. In 1707, Van Rensselaer then sold his rights to the six square-mile tract               east of the Hudson River and north of <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> to the city of Albany. The heart of the Schaghticoke tract was desirable farmland in the <a href="../map/johnsonmap.html">Hoosick Valley</a> about sixteen miles northwest of Albany. However, some <a href="../res/ts.html">sources</a> date the first European settlement as early as 1668.  </p>

              were granted to Martin de Lamont, <a href="../bios/q/woq2323.html">Wouter

              leases became ownership deeds.</p>
            <p>Some of the first Schaghticoke landholders were younger sons of 
              established <a href="../familynames.html">Albany families</a>. Others 
              were more marginal but long-standing city people seeking a new start 
              in the Hoosick Valley. At the same time, Livingston and others obtained 
              Schaghticoke titles for investment purposes.</p>
            <p>Permanent settlement of the area was retarded by a <a href="http://www.mechanicville.com/history/articles/who_killed_capt%20bratt.htm">bloody 
              incident</a> between settlers and Native peoples in October 1711 
              that left Albany native Captain <a href="../bios/b/jobradt4253.html">Johannes 
              Bradt</a> and members of his household dead and others taken to 
              Quebec as prisoners.</p>
<p><a name=church></a><a href="../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditionally, the Dutch Reformed Church at Schaghticoke dates from 1714 - although it sometimes relied on missionary service from <a href="../drc.html">Albany</a> and elsewhere. The first log church was destroyed during an Indian raid. Its surviving <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/sdrcb.htm?cj=1&o_xid=0000713921&o_lid=0000713921">baptism</a> and <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/sdrcm.htm">marriage</a> records date from 1750. A new church was built in 1760. Beginning in 1715, parish burials were made in the Knickerbocker family plot. A number of city residents were married there.</p>

<p>A base <a href="#1720">list</a> of Schaghticoke freeholders in <a href="../lists/list1720.html">1720</a> appears online. Included on that list were <a href="../bios/d/sadox572.html">Samuel             Dox</a> and a number of other former Albany residents.

<p><a href="#corp"><img src="../images/jpg/na/sgtkecorp400.jpg" align=left width=400 height=291 border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Corporation Lands at Schaghticoke - post war"></a>With tenants farming good Hoosick Valley bottomland and paying 
              annual rents in wheat and wood to their Albany landlord, Schaghticoke 
              figured to become a successful agricultural enterprise. But because 
              those farms were vulnerable to Indian attack, after 1745 the agricultural 
              settlement did not flourish. Only the most determined settlers were 
              able to resist the temptation to take refuge in Albany during the 
              darkest days of the <a href="../7yw.html">colonial wars</a> and 
              the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. 
            <p><a name=14></a>During the Revolution, the Fourteenth Regiment of 
              the Albany County <a href="../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> represented 
              Schaghticoke and was commanded by Johannes Knickerbacker and then 
              by Albany native <a href="../bios/y/piyates4429.html">Pieter Yates</a>.</p>
			  
 <p>Schaghticoke officially became a district of <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> in 1772 and a town in 1788. The <a href="../census1790.html">census of 1790</a> showed the town with a population of 1,838 including 348 slaves - an indicator of the prosperity of its established farmers. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/schag.htm">Schaghticoke</a> became part of new Rensselaer County in 1791. A transcription of the town census for 1800 has been placed <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/census7.htm?cj=1&o_xid=0001027214&o_lid=0001027214">online</a>. Part of the town was annexed by <a href="lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> in 1819.

<p>At some point after the Revolution [we search for a more specific useful date], Schaghticoke tenants ceased paying rents to the city of Albany.

<p>Located on the banks of the Hoosic River and a few miles from the upper Hudson River and canal, Schaghticoke grew as a market town and manufacturing community during the nineteenth century. Today, it is the name of a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaghticoke_(village),_New_York">village</a> and a much larger surrounding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schaghticoke_(town),_New_York">town</a>. The <a href="http://www.knickmansion.com/">Knickerbocker Historical Society</a> preserves and interprets the history of greater Schaghticoke, its early settlers, and the traditions of "<a href="http://www.knic.com/traditin.htm">Knickerbocker History</a>."</p>
