<p>For our <a href="#source">purposes</a>, the Coeymans Patent refers to the large tract of <a href="../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> first "purchased" by New Netherland pioneer <a href="../bios/c/bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieterse Coeymans</a> in 1672 or 1673. It is located in the present town of Coeymans in southern <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> - a dozen miles below the city of Albany. Relevant landmarks are the "Coeymans House" and the Coeymans <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeymans_Creek">and/or</a> Onesquethaw Creek(s). 

<p>Admittedly, this presentation is a simple compilation of materials on the Coeymans Patent. We seek to efficiently define its parameters, identify especially its Albany-based owners, and connect their holdings there to the history of the city of Albany. We are at the <a href="../inprog.html">beginning</a> of that initiative.

<p>In August 1714, the patent appears to have been conferred on <a href="../bios/c/andcoey.html">Andries Coeymans</a> - son of Barent Pieterse. Its borders have been <a href="#desc">described</a> as “the Lands in & near the Manor of Rensselaerswyck . . . Beginning at a creek called Peter Bronck’s creek or the creek of Coxsackie including the same creek, on the west side of Hudsons River thence up along the said River as it runs to over against the middle of Jan Ryersen’s Island to a small run of water, thence from the said River backwards up into the woods W & by N. half a point more northerly 12 English miles being the northern bounds of said land; & the southern bounds beginning at the north of the said Peter Bronck’s creek & thence up the same, including the same as aforesaid, until it comes to Coxsackie, and thence up into the woods by a due west course until it is 12 English miles distant from the mouth of said creek, from the west end of which distance last mentioned a straight line being drawn northerly until it meets and closes with the west end of the aforesaid northerly bounds makes the western bounds thereof, and the easterly bounds thereof in the said River, according to a grant made by Gov. Lovelace April 7, 1673, to said Barent Petersen, and an adjustment of boundaries made by deed dated Oct. 22,1706, between Killan Van Rensselaer, and the said Barent Pietersen and Andries.” 

<p>Although the Coeymans Patent appears to have been issued in 1714, not until December 1766 did the provincial Council <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA518&lpg=PA518&dq">confirm</a> the originally patented acres to the Coeymans patentees.

<p>From the initial grant through the eighteenth century, members of the Coeymans, Ten Eyck, and Verplanck families appear to have been <a href="../econ/comec.html">utilizing</a> the land. Some of them were tied to the city of Albany.

<p><a href="../bios/qqqq.html#one">O</a>ne <a href="http://archives.nypl.org/mss/4213">David Mc Carty</a> is said to have surveyed the patent.

<p>The town of Coeymans was formed from <a href="watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> in 1791.

<P>Description of the Coeymans Patent copied from an <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/beers_history_of_greene_county_coxsackie.htm">online transcription</a> of pages the Beers <i>History of Greene County</i>:
<blockquote>
<p>In 1673 General Lovelace granted to Barent Pietersen:

<p>“A tract of land on the west side of Hudson’s river to the north of a place by the Indians called Koxhaexy, stretching in length to the highest place where Jacob Flodder did use to roll down his timber, named by the Indians, Siekatoms, to the south of the Island belonging to Jan Reyersen, and into the woods as far as the said Indiana Sachems right goes, as also the wood land, kills, creeds, valleys and meadows, thereunto appertaining without any reservation as purchased by said Barent of the principal Sachems at the Katskill.” 

<p>This grant is generally known as Coeyman’s Old Patent. In 1685 a patent was granted to Killian Van Rensselaer which conveyed to him.

<p>“All that tract of land called Rensselaerswyck lying upon the banks of Hudson’s river in the County of Albany, heretofore known by the name of the Colony of Rensselaerswyck. Beginning at the south end or part of Beeren Island in Hudson’s River extending northwards up along both sides of said river, unto a place heretofore called the Kahoos or the Great Falls of the said river, and extending itself east and west all along from each die to the said river backwards into the woods 24 English miles.” 

<p>In 1714 Andries Coeymans, son and heir of Brent Pietersen, made application for a new patent of confirmation for the tract of land granted to his father by Governor Lovelace, and in compliance with this application a new patent was granted him August 16th 1714, which conveyed to him as follows: 

<p>“The Lands in & near the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, of which his Father died seized & bounded as follows. Beginning at a creek called Peter Bronck’s creek or the creek of Coxsackie including the same creek, on the west side of Hudsons River thence up along the said River as it runs to over against the middle of Jan Ryersen’s Island to a small run of water, thence from the said River backwards up into the woods W & by N. half a point more northerly 12 English miles being the northern bounds of said land; & the southern bounds beginning at the north of the said Peter Bronck’s creek & thence up the same, including the same as aforesaid, until it comes to Coxsackie, and thence up into the woods by a due west course until it is 12 English miles distant from the mouth of said creek, from the west end of which distance last mentioned a straight line being drawn northerly until it meets and closes with the west end of the aforesaid northerly bounds makes the western bounds thereof, and the easterly bounds thereof in the said River, according to a grant made by Gov. Lovelace April 7, 1673, to said Barent Petersen, and an adjustment of boundaries made by deed dated Oct. 22,1706, between Killam Van Rensselaer, and the said Barent Pietersen and Andries.” 

<p>Beeren Island is the small rocky island below Coeyman’s Landing, and as the north bounds of the tract granted to Barent Pietersen were far beyond this, it will be seen that Van Rensselaer’s patent encroached upon it and made a tract of disputed lands.  The contest which then arose between the parties claiming the land in dispute was settled by Killiam Van Rensselaer’s giving to Andries Coeymans a deed releasing to him all his right and title to the whole trace.  This deed is referred to in the patent granted to Coeymans in 1714, and is recorded in book H of deeds, page 209, in the county clerk’s office at Albany.

<p>In those early days large grants of land were frequently made, with boundaries that encroached upon prior patents or grants. In such cases the earliest grant was generally sustained, and, as land was of little value, one 
            of the parties generally bought the claims of the others. The patent 
            granted to Peter Bronk was of earlier date than any other in the part 
            of the country. The north boundary, being a line running west from 
            the south side of the mouth of Coxsackie Creek to the Indian footpath, 
            was established by arbitration, as stated in a description of the 
            12th allotment of Coeyman’s Patent, contained in the field book of 
            the survey and division, in the county clerks office in Albany. The 
            place which the Indians called Coxsackie was undoubtedly at the upper 
            village, and a line running west from the bridge over the creek was 
            always considered the south boundary of Coeyman’s Patent. That the 
            land between the bridge and the Catskill Path was a part of the Bronk 
            Patent was never disputed.
