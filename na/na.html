        <blockquote> 
          <p>Since its inception in 1981, the <a href="../whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial 
            Albany Social History Project</i></a> has prided itself on its <a href="../res/inq.html">focus</a>! 
			
          <p>The project intends to make substantial and original contributions 
            to the history of the people of colonial Albany by concentrating on 
            its <a href="../criteria.html">defined study population</a> - namely 
            on the lives of those 16,000 men, women, and children within the setting 
            that <a href="../charter.html">b</a>ecame and <a href="../citylimits.html">is</a> 
            the <a href="../earlycity.html">city</a> of Albany.
			 
          <p>In other words, look for us to begin to illuminate and 
            perhaps even suggest <a href="../newfeatures.html">answers</a> to questions 
            relating to every person, place, and thing germane to the early Albany 
            story. The <u>city of Albany</u> that is! We cannot begin to take responsibility 
            for the historic "Albanys" <a href="../albanycounty.html">beyond</a> 
            our defined perameters.
			 
          <p>That said, out of necessity (we believe), we have posted a number 
            of features on <a href="castle.html">places</a> and things and <a href="../bios/staff/historians.html">people</a> 
            even that relate to our mission but are technically beyond the scope 
            of our research. First, we claim no original contribution and/or insight 
            on any of these topics. They appears on this website to help explicate 
            our early Albany story. Beyond that, we hold no original resources 
            that relate to those things we define as "Not Albany." 
			
          <p>A number of biographical, geographical, and descriptive features 
            appear on the pages of this website that fall into the "not Albany" 
            category. Perhaps - something on every web page. These are intended to help explain the actual subjects 
            but have not been accorded much priority in their development. That 
            said, <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">some</a> are quite substantial 
            and will continue to evolve to better support our mission to shed 
            light on the people of colonial Albany and their world.</p>

        <p><a name=source></a>This particular explanatory page was prompted by 
          our need to begin work on a page focused on the "new city" of <a href="lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> 
          during the autumn of 2009. That initiative has raised a number of useful 
          issues for us - making the effort there well worthwhile. What appears above is just a thought 
          - for now!
