<p>Taking into account numerous spelling and variations of address, the term <a href="#spelling">"Rensselaerswyck"</a> identifies the large tract of land first granted to <a href="../bios/vr/kvr.html">K</a>illiaen Van Rensselaer in 1629 and "owned" by his <a href="../bios/vr/vr.html">descendants</a> for more than the next two hundred years.

<p> Although its exact boundaries defied definition, it included all the land that surrounded the city of Albany. In fact, <a href="../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
          and then <a href="../charter.html">Albany</a> encompassed <a href="../citylimits.html">land</a> (a one-by-sixteen mile tract by its charter definition) that had been carved out of the manor - very much against the wishes of the Van Rensselaers.</p>
		   
<a href="#map"><img src="../images/jpg/mapratzerrwyk.jpg" alt="Map showing Rensselaerswyck in 1776"  align=left border=1 hspace=8 vspace=1 width=350 height=305></a>

            <p>Killiaen Van Rensselaer took step to establish a plantation or 
              "patroonship" in the upper Hudson Valley as an efficient way to 
              cultivate the land and mine the wilderness for farm and forest products 
              that could be exported to Europe and sold. Before his death in 1643, 
              the "first Patroon" engaged hundreds of talented and willing settlers 
              from <a href="../nnd.html">across Europe</a> and sent them to Rensselaerswyck 
              to be his tenants. These American pioneers were primarily farmers 
              but also were artisans, tradesmen, and others who could support 
              what became the most successful settlement initiative of the New 
              Netherland era.</P>

            <p>Initially, most of Van Rensselaer's tenants settled within a few 
              miles of <a href="../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>. Some 
              of these tenants did practice agriculture and husbandry as specified 
              in the terms of their contracts. But, in general, any effort to 
              make the plantation profitable for the Patroon was compromised by 
              the widespread interest in <a href="../furtrade.html">trading for 
              furs</a> - initially an irresistible avenue to riches for many living 
              in the region.</p>

            <p>On Killian Van Rensselaer's death in 1643, management of the American estate 
              passed to through two generations of his descendants to <a href="../bios/vr/kvr5054.html">Killiaen 
              Van Rensselaer</a>. In 1704 "the Lower Manor" (<a href="#greenbush">Greenbush</a> 
              and Claverack) was detached and placed under the direction of Killiaen's 
              brother, <a href="../bios/vr/hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a> 
              - a one-time Albany <a href="../cityfathers.html">city father</a>. 
              This partition made the northern part of the estate (Rensselaerswyck) 
              even more important to the history of the city of Albany.</p>

<p>In 1685, royal governor Thomas Dongan had issued a patent for the "Manor of Rensselaerswyck" - establishing the patroonship as a legal entity, <a href="#borders">describing its borders</a>, and defining the special rights of its proprietor. The patent also specifically excluded ". . . fort Albany and the Towne Albany" from the manor 
- setting the stage for Dongan's granting of the Albany <a href="../charter.html">city charter</a> in July 1686. <a href="../inprog.html"> <img src="../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" height=10 alt="more to come!"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Crailo"><img src="../images/modern/crailo.jpg" align=right border=1 width=150 alt="Crailo in 2002"></a> In 1704, the Van Rensselaers partitioned the manor into two parts with the "lower manor" called Claverack going to Albany trader <a href="../bios/vr/hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a> who built <a href="">Crailo</a> and, in 1740, passed the estate on to his <a href="../bios/vr/jovr5127.html">son</a>.</p>

<p>Although a part of <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>, from 1691 to 1775 Rensselaerswyck sent its own representative to the provincial Assembly. After the War for Independence, that seat was enveloped in Albany County. In March 1779, the new State legislature enacted <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0N8TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq">legislation</a> dividing the Manor into East and West districts.  In 1788, <a href="watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> was made a separate district. In 1793, <a href="bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> was made a town within Albany County. The manor on the east side of the Hudson (known as Greenbush) became part of newly created Rensselaer County in 1791.</p>

            <p>On the death of his father in 1747, <a href="../bios/vr/svr5114.html">Stephen 
              Van Rensselaer II</a> became Patroon at age 5. During his short 
              tenure, he expanded the tenant base and made a number of improvements 
              on the property. On his death in 1769, the estate passed to his 
              son, five-year-old <a href="../bios/vr/svr3.html">Stephen III</a>, and was administered by kinsman 
              <a href="../bios/t/abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a> until 
              the young Patroon came of age in 1784. By that time, the manor was 
              the most populated entity within Albany County. 

       <p><a href="#1806"><img src="../images/jpg/na/patroonagent1806.jpg" align=left border=1 width=200 height=190 alt="sketch by James Eights of the house of the patroon's agent in 1806"></a>The     population continued to grow as what became Watervliet and then 
              Bethlehem filled up with new tenants and other residents over the 
              next their years. As Stephen Van Rensselaer III became more and 
              more prominent and occupied on different stages, the day-to-day 
              operations of the manor were more administered by the Patroon's 
              agents. The three decade career of <a href="../bios/d/rodunbar2271.html">Robert 
              Dunbar, Jr.</a>, as the Patroon's Agent, is the most notable of these stewardships.  Technically, 
              the manor ceased to exist following the death of <a href="../bios/vr/svr3.html">Stephen 
              Van Rensselaer III</a> in 1839. However, the Van Rensselaer family 
              continued to live at the <a href="vrmh.html">Manor House</a>, the 
              focal point of manor activity, for many years.</p>
<a name=tenant></a>
<p>Technically, everyone living within the boundaries of the Manor was a Van Rensselaer tenant. However, there seemed to be many exceptions as a number of large farms including <a href="schuylerflats.html">Schuyler Flats</a> may have paid no r
als. The first tenants were engaged by proprietor Killian Van Rensselaer and sent to America. Those pioneer <a href="../nnd.html">New Netherland Dutch</a> came from across Europe and have been profiled in <a href="#sources"><i>The Van Rensselaer Bowier Manuscripts</i></a>. They constituted a major population source for the city of Albany. The manor grew slowly over the next century as subsequent proprietors attracted new tenants from those already in America.</p>

<p>The number of leases increased dramatically after the end of the <a href="../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a> as Stephen II and his successor, administrator and Van Rensselaer son-in-law  <a href="../bios/t/abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a>, became much more active in utilizing the potential of the land. New tenants of the third quarter of the eighteenth century primarily were <a href="../newcomers.html">recently arrived</a> Europeans (many of German background) and some New Englanders. The <a href="../im/im1767.html">map</a> drawn by Albany surveyor <a href="../bios/b/jorbleecker201.html">John R. Bleecker</a> in 1767 locates many of those landholders. After 1784, Stephen III continued to engage tenants with many of the surviving leases dating from his tenure. These tenants included some Europeans and old Albany people. But they were primarily young Yankees who had spread west out of New England!</p>
<a name=census></a>
<p>The earliest surviving census of the Manor was made in <a href="../census1697.html#rw">1697</a>. A <a href="http://genealogy-quest.com/1720-county-albany-new-york-rensselaerswyck/">list</a> of freeholders provides eighty-one names of men in the "colony" of Rensselaerwsyck in <a href="../lists/list1720.html">1720</a> and likewise in <a href="../lists/list1742fl.html#rw">1742</a> . The Watervliet portion of the census of 1790 <a href="../census1790.html#watervliet">appears</a> elsewhere on this website.</p>

<p>This sketch focuses on Rensselaerswyck but in its Albany context. It is NOT a comprehensive history of the patroonship. One wishes that it could do for the manor what the <a href="../whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a> is doing for the <a href="../criteria.html">city</a> of Albany. Alas, it <a href="na.html">cannot</a>!

<p><b>Rensselaerswyck:</b> <a name=spelling></a>The <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> has adopted this spelling as the most frequently used and most easily accessible form of the word. For convenience, we consider the landed entity described here to be interchangeable with the place also known as "Van Rensselaer's Manor" or "the Patroonship."</p>
