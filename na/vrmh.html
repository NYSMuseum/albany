<p><b>G</b>one since the 1890s, "Van Rensselaer Manor House" remains a legendary local term used to describe the seat of <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> Manor. But for more than two centuries, a Van Rensselaer <a href="../bios/vr/vr.html">family</a> headquarters was located on the premises - the flats along the Hudson, east of the river road, and about a mile <a href="../loc/northend.html">north</a> of the center of the <a href="../earlycity.html">city</a> of Albany.</p>

<p>An early Van Rensselaer farm on that site was destroyed by a flood in 1666. Shortly thereafter, <a href="../bios/vr/jevr.html">Jeremias Van Rensselaer</a> erected a more enduring <a href="#pruyn">structure</a> <a href="#pruyn"><img src="../images/vrmanorsketch.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 width=150 alt="sketch of Van Rensselaer house in 17th century"></a>             near where Patroon's Creek flowed into the Hudson River. Although "Patroon" Jeremias lived only until <a href="../lists/list1674jvrfun.html">1674</a>, 
            that building served as the family's country seat until the end of 
            the <a href="../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. It was built "country 
            style" with the entrance on the long side and with outbuildings attached. 
            Although superseded by a more elaborate manor house, that brick building 
            stood until torn down in 1839.

<p>In 1765, Patroon <a href="../bios/vr/svr5114.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer II</a> erected a new manor house on the property. It was a large brick structure - almost forty-six feet deep with a gambrel roof and pedimented dormers. The central entrance on the south side opened into a great 
            hallway. He died in 1769 before he could enjoy its grandeur. His <a href="../bios/l/calivingston5034.html">widow</a> lived there with all her children until the heir to the Manor came of age in the 1780s. <a href="../bios/vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer III</a> lived at the mansion for many years and further 
            enlarged the building - adding octagonal wings in 1820.</p>
<p>In colonial times, the Manor House was the centerpoint and principal landmark of an <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> town called the "West Manor." But during the 1770s, its location was often given as <a href="watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> - officially designated 
            as a town in 1788.<a href="#1857"><img src="../images/map1857vrmhdet.jpg" align=left width=300 height=294 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Van Rensselaer Mansion in 1857"></a> 
            However, the Van Rensselaers owned much of the land and seem to have 
            enjoyed a great deal of freedom in orchestrating its development. 
            In 1815, the land surrounding the manor house was <a  href="../citylimits.html">annexed</a> 
            to the city of Albany.

 <p><a href="../bios/d/rodunbar2271.html">Robert Dunbar</a> was the patroon's business agent until he retired in 1835 and was succeeded by his nephew, <a href="../bios/p/cafpruyn.html">Casparus F. Pruyn</a>, who had worked for Dunbar for many years. </p> 
<p>During the 1840s, the building was extensively remodeled by Stephen Van Rensselaer IV who lived there until his death in 1868. In 1857, historian Benson Lossing <a href="http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/hudson/wwm9822/@Generic__BookTextView/2330">described</a> the Van Rensselaer property. By the 1870s, the property was abandoned by a Van Rensselaer family that now found the surrounding factories, railroads, and canal less conducive to manorial living than in days past.</P>

            by an expanding railroad, family members sought to have the entire 
            building relocated. Unable to have the structure designated as the 
            "New York State Building" at the Columbian Exposition, in 1895, the 
            mansion was dismantled and partially reassembled on the campus of 
            Williams College in Massachusetts. As "<a href="http://archives.williams.edu/williamshistory/sawyerlibrary/rensselaerindex.php">Van 
            Rensselaer Hall</a>," it served as a fraternity house and in other 
            capacities until 1973 when it was <a href="#later">demolished</a>!</p>

<p><a name=neu></a>Adaptation and compression (image compressed) of <a href="http://www.njwomenshistory.org/Period_2/neuville.htm">Anne Marguerite Hyde de Neuville</a>'s water level painting as reproduced in <a href="http://www.wikigallery.org/wiki/painting_197098/Anne-Marguerite-Hyde-de-Neuville/Major-van-Rensselaers-House-near-Albany-New-York">Wiki Gallery</a>. The artist came to the United States in 1807 and created a number of paintings of historic locations in upstate New York. This image dated "1807" is included here as it most closely resembled the Van Rensselaer country seat during the era of the American Revolution. In 1807, it would have been the home of <a href="../bios/vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer III</a>. 

<p><a name=pruyn></a>This <b>drawing</b> was made by Albany artist Francis Pruyn just before the building was razed in 1839. It is in the collection of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org">Albany Institute of History and Art</a>.

Poor quality print copy filed in the CASHP <a href="../grapharch.html">Graphics Archive</a>.

<p><a name=later></a>Some of the stones were returned to the Albany area. Previously, some of the <a href="http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic20-02-011.html">interior parts</a> were donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
