<p>This exposition is intended to place Lansingburgh in its Albany context. It is <a href="na.html">NOT</a> a definitive community history but, for our purposes, a part of the history of the city of Albany. 

     <p>Defined here as the land on the eastern side of the Hudson River and 
          about eight miles north of the city of Albany. The land was granted to Albany resident <a href="../bios/s/rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a> during the seventeenth century. In 1683, he sold it to <a href="../bios/w/jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a> whose <a href="#map"><img src="../images/jpg/maps/lansingburghjrb.jpg" align=right border=1 width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="detail from 1767 map showing Lansing's house"></a>heirs left it mostly dormant for the next seventy years. The land was known <a href="../res/sp.html">var</a>iously as "Steen Rabe" or "Stone Arabia." Concentrated European-style settlement on those lands dates from the period following the end of the <a href="../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. 
		  
<p>In 1763, Albany native and resident farmer <a href="../bios/l/ablansing3692.html">Abraham Ja. Lansing</a> purchased the land from the Wendells. He is credited with dividing his farm into lots that could be laid out into a village. Abraham Jacobse called the tract "Lansingburgh." Anticipating a grand future, for several decades local boosters also would refer to the settlement as the "New City."
		   
        <p>Following a survey of the land made in June 1771 by Yankee surveyor <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rCkSMC0fKmsC&pg=PA9&lpg=PA9&dq=%22joseph+blanchard%22+map&source=bl&ots=XSrvSwxm5U&sig=FZABrMdaGahfpdVk3GNQAwCqTpg&hl=en&ei=dzcdS5v4MojilAe9wLTxCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBEQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22joseph%20blanchard%22%20map&f=false">Joseph Blanchard</a>, building lots were sold to both settlers and investors. A list of the owners of the original lots within it has appeared in 
          a number of traditional <a href="#source">sources</a>. The owners included a number of Albany 
          city residents. A composite of that list follows:

		<p>In 1774, future Albany resident <a href="../bios/vv/mavvranken6490.html">Maus R. Van Vranken</a> is <a href="../res/ts.html">said</a> to have opened a bi-lingual school there.

<p>By 1791, the village of Lansingburgh was a well-known part of newly created Rensselaer County. It was erected as a town in 1807.
