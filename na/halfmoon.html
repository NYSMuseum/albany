        <p>"Halfmoon" is a location in old <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany 
          County</a>. The <i><a href="http://www.halfmoon.mus.ny.us/">Half Moon</a></i> 
          is the ship Henry Hudson sailed up the North River in 1609! Both have 
          substantial histories in their own right. The purpose of <b>this</b> 
          exposition is to place references to "Halfmoon" (the <a href="#source">place</a>) in their 
          early Albany <a href="na.html">context</a>.
<p>Initially, the name referred to a cluster of small islands where the 
          Mohawk met the Hudson River. It was called "Half Moon Point" and was 
          a place where Albany people met Native Americans to trade for <a href="../furtrade.html">furs</a>. 
          Located north (beyond the jurisdiction) of the manor of <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, 
          much of it was encompassed in the <a href="#vsp">V</a>an Schaick <a href="../res/realestate.html">Patent</a> 
          granted by the English in 1674. After some pioneering that was curtailed by the intermittant threat of war, substantial settlement occurred mostly after the coming of <a href="../peace.html">peace</a> during the first decades of the eighteenth century. 
		  
<p>During the <a href="../art/miller.html">1690s</a>, a <a href="../bios/m/jmiller.html">traveler</a> noted that settlement in the area known as "the halfmoon" was dormant. 		  
		  
<p><a href="../bios/vs/ghvschoon5887.html">Geurt Hendrickse</a> (patriarch of the <a href="../bios/vs/vschoon.html">Van Schoonhoven</a> family), a pioneer settler, parcelled out his lands there before his death in 1702. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pPA5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA465&lpg=PA465&dq=%22schoonhoven%22&source=bl&ots=rM7vylFnve&sig=5483I5t5nKy9PxMEwldqv3zeXTU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sr3sU8qaFYzhoATPwoDgDg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22schoonhoven%22&f=false">1715</a>, <a href="../bios/vs/jgvschoon5896.html">Jacobus Van Schoonhoven</a>'s militia company was composed mostly of men from the Halfmoon area.
		  
<p>In <a href="../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, a list of freeholders for Albany city and county included a <a href="#1720">separate listing</A> for Halfmoon. Its initial resident <a href="#1720">settlers</a> were primarily of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> ancestry - also representing overflow members of a number of prominent early Albany families - in particular the <a href="../bios/vd/vdb.html">Vandenberghs</a> and Van Schoonhovens.
		   
<p>In 1788, the town of Halfmoon was erected within Albany County. In 1790, the first Federal <a href="../census1790.html">census</a> counted its population as 3,602 residents in 607 households including 128 slaves and seven free persons of color (all in a single household). By that time, New Englanders had outnumbered the descendants of New  Netherland. In 1791, the town of Halfmoon became part of newly formed Saratoga County.
		  
<p>In 1794, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterford_(town),_New_York">Waterford</a> tavernkeeper and future Albany resident <a href="../bios/g/magregory8273.html">Matthew Gregory</a> was named one of the first trustees of "Half Moon Point." Waterford was split off as a separate town in 1816.		  
		   
<p><a href="../albanycounty.html">Located</a> on fertile land above both the Mohawk and the Hudson and beyond the boundaries of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck, Halfmoon represented a desirable destination for the children of Albany residents and for newcomers as well.</p>
