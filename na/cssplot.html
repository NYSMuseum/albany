<a href="#pictures"><img src="../images/cssmonument.jpg" width=250 height=370 border=1 alt="Captain Samuel Schuyler monument" align=left hspace=4 vspace=4></a> <b>O</b>n a bluff overlooking the Hudson River at the <a href="../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a> is a monument to Afro Albanian patriarch <a href="../bios/s/sschuyler8492.html">Captain Samuel Schuyler</a>.</p>

<p>This granite icon is instantly recognizable by a ship's anchor carved into its east and west faces. It is located in section 66 and is situated on one of the most commanding vistas at the cemetery. The Samuel Schuyler monument literally towers over the tombstones of a number of notables including New York Governor William L. Marcy and renowned Albany painter <a href="../bios/a/ea.html">Ezra Ames</a>.</p>

<p>The monument celebrates the marriage of Samuel and Mary Schuyler 
              and the lives of three of their most prominent sons. It probably 
              was erected sometime after the death of Thomas Schuyler in 1866. 
              It is the centerpiece of a larger family plot that includes more 
              than a dozen individual stones. 
<p> <a href="#pictures"><img src="../images/cssplot15.jpg" align=right  width=250 border=1 alt="The Samuel Schuyler family plot" hspace=4 vspace=4></a>This beautiful Schuyler family plot also is a cornerstone of a <a href="../pgms/css.html">grassroots effort</a> to restore the family to its place of importance in Albany history. That initiative led to the commissioning of historical artist <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com">Len Tantillo</a> to produce a <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/shop/19th-Century/Portrait-of-America/prod_76.html">painting</a> of a Schuyler towboat set against the backdrop of Schuyler's south Albany neighborhood. </P>

            <P><a name=cemetery></a>The <b>Albany Rural Cemetery</b> was opened 
              in 1844. It was one of the first major embodiments of the rural 
              cemetery movement in the United States. Graves were relocated there 
              from cemeteries and plots throughout Albany beginning in 1845. The 
              first local history of the cemetery appeared in the <a href="../sources.html#ht"><i>Bicentennial 
              History of Albany</i></a>, pp. 674-76. Subsequent references can 
              be found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Rural_Cemetery">Wikipedia</a> 
              entry and on the cemetery's official <a href="http://albanyruralcemetery.org/"> 
              website</a>. All of these have been superseded by publication of 
              Paul Grondahl's <i>These Exalted Acres: Unlocking the Secrets of 
              Albany Rural Cemetery</i> in <a href="../loc/arc.html">2013</a>. 
              It is widely available for purchase in printed form and also appears
