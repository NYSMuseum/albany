      <p><a href="#name"><b>Watervliet</b></a> is defined here as the part of 
        <a href="rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> west of the Hudson 
        and surrounding the city of Albany. The term seems to have appeared during 
        the third quarter of the eighteenth century. It was referred to often 
        but not definitively during the 1760s and 70s. In 1788, Watervliet was 
        erected as a town, a separate jurisdiction within <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a>. In 1790, it had a population of <a href="../census1790.html#watervliet">7,419</a> 
        - more than twice that of the <a href="../census1790.html">city of Albany</a>. 
        By that time many people who lived there pursued activities that fed directly 
        into the <a href="../econ/comec.html">Albany economy</a>. This overview considers early Watervliet in its early Albany <a href="../res/context.html">context</a>.</p>

      <p>By our <a href="#definition">definition</a>, the town of Watervliet was all of 
        Albany County on the west bank of the Hudson except for the city of Albany. 
        In <a href="../census1790.html#watervliet">1790</a>, most of its people lived 
        within a mile of the Hudson River north and south of Albany. In 1793, 
        "<a href="bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>" (located south of Albany) 
        was detached and erected as a town on its own. Other detachments followed. 
        During the 1820s, Watervliet still encompassed about fifty-three square 
        miles. It was bounded by Albany to the south, the Hudson River on the 
        east, and the north line of Rensselaerswyck (for ten miles along the Mohawk 
        River). Historically, Watervliet has been known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_town_creation_in_New_York%27s_Capital_District">the Mother of Towns</a>" in the Capital District.
		
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonie,_New_York">Colonie</a> ("the Colonie") would be incorporated as a municipality within Watervliet in 1791 and as a separate town in 1808. Over the last four decades, <a href="https://www.colonie.org/departments/historian/historicalsociety/">The Historical Society of the Town of Colonie</a> and the Colonie <a href="https://www.colonie.org/departments/historian/">Town Historian's</a> office have sustained and even enhanced outstanding heritage services.</P>

      <p>The Van Rensselaer <a href="vrmh.html">Manor House</a> (located about a mile 
        north of the old Dutch Church), <a href="schuylerflats.html">Schuyler 
        Flats"</a>, the <a href="../loc/kingshighway.html">King's Highway</a>, 
        and Patroon's Creek are among the locations that can be explored further 
        on this website. <a href="http://shakerworkshops.com/resources/who-are-the-shakers/some-further-sketches-of-the-life-and-character-of-mother-ann-lee-by-mehetabel-farrington"><img src="../images/jpg/na/annleegravestone.jpg" align=right width=95 height=110 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="Mother Ann Lee died was buried in Watervliet in 1784"></a> 
        These locations are shown on the <a href="../im/im1767.html">Bleecker 
        map</a> of 1767. However, "Watervliet" was not then labeled as such. We 
        still seek the earliest (or an appropriately early) cartographic representation 
        of the term "Watervliet." The settlement made by the Shakers at <a href="niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a> 
        in 1776 was frequently referred to as "Watervliet." However, the Shakers 
        avoided the city of Albany and apparently its people as well. At this 
        point, we have found that they played no role in the life of the city. 
        Located just north of the original city line and situated on the Hudson 
        River flood plain, the <a href="../loc/qhouse.html">Quackenbush house</a> 
        is a historical landmark that survives today as the best example of eighteenth 
        century city architecture. 
      <p>In its Albany context, "Watervliet" means the overflow area <a href="../loc/northend.html">north</a> of the Foxes Creek ravine that ran along the <a href="../loc/northend.html#road">river road</a> to the Van Rensselaer Manor House. From the 1750s onward, it was a new settlement area populated by immigrants and newcomers who all would have been Van Rensselaer tenants. Some of their homes were shown a British army <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/h?ammem/gmd:@field(NUMBER+@band(g3804a+ar112900))">map</a> dated 1758 and now preserved in the Library of Congress.
<p>The first town meeting was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA929&lpg=PA929&dq=%22william+kane%22+watervliet&source=bl&ots=m0fYUBfMiQ&sig=IRLMvIWTWuIGVCuUyXQUuE4aBpk&hl=en&ei=nudRS6HMJJWOlAflrNWgCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20kane%22%20watervliet&f=false">said</a> to have been held at the house of <a href="../bios/k/wmkane2529.html">William Kane</a> in April 1809.

Today, the city of Watervliet is located directly north of the densely settled, pre-industrial entity of the same name.</p>
