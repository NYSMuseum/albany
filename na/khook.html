<p><b>K</b>inderhook was a village and town in old <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. It was and is located on the eastern side of the Hudson River about twenty miles southeast of Albany and about five miles upstream from <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~clifflamere/History/Col/StuyvesantColCo.htm">Kinderhook Landing</a> - Kinderhook's <a href="http://www.hhr.highlands.com/kinderhook.htm">river port</a>. Today, Kinderhook is located in northern <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycolumb/">Columbia County</a>.

<p><a href="http://www.historicmapsrestored.com/countymaps/a-d/columbia-ny-1829.html"><img src="../images/jpg/maps/kinderhookmap.jpg" align=left border=1 width=300 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="19th century map of the Kinderhook area"></a>Kinderhook was founded by overflow <a href="../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> families from Albany beginning during the 1660s. <a href="../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources state there were thirty-one original patentees.  The settlement formed on the west bank of the Kinderhook Creek and the first lots were deeded about 1681. A Dutch Reformed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformed_Dutch_Church_(Kinderhook,_New_York)">church</a> is said to have been in operation <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/kind/reformed_protestant_dutch_church.htm">there</a> as early as 1712. Before that, spiritual <a href="../drc.html">services</a> were supplied from Albany.

        <p>A number of early Albany families including the <a href="../bios/va/vallen.html">Van 
          Allens</a> and the <a href="../bios/va/valst.html">Van Alstynes</a> 
          basically relocated there while others including the <a href="../bios/vs/vschaick.html">Van 
          Schaicks</a> established branches in and around this agricultural center. 
        <p>Albany native <a href="../bios/v/pivosburgh.html">Pieter Vosburgh</a> was a justice of the peace for Kinderhook as early as 1681. A loyalty oath named prominent residents of greater Kinderhook in <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/NYC-ROOTS/2002-04/1017838608">1699</a>. 

<p><a href="#va"><img src="../images/modern/vanallenkhook.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 width=200 alt="Van Allen house - Kinderhook's old surviving home"></a>Kinderhook property holders were named on an <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/kind/kinderhook_%201744_tax_list.htm">assessment roll</a> in 1744. The <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycolumb/col-frek.htm">freeholders</a> list for 1763 named propertied residents of the village and its hinterland. At that time, fifteen houses and a church had been built on a ridge along the Kinderhook Creek. A number of Albany people owned land located "behind Kinderhook."

<p>Prominent Albany attorney <a href="../bios/s/psilvester.html">Peter Silvester</a> moved his family to Kinderhook during the early 1770s. By that time, would-be Albany Stamp Tax collector <a href="../bios/vs/hvschaack.html">Henry Van Schaack</a> had returned to his Kinderhook roots.

<p>President Martin Van Buren was born at Kinderhook in 1782. The town of Kinderhook, within newly formed Columbia County, was erected in 1788. In <a href="../census1790.html">1790</a>, the town of Kinderhook (somewhat larger than the village) had a population of 4,661 including 638 slaves and six free people of color. Kinderhook was incorporated as a <a href="http://village.kinderhookny.us/">village</a> in 1838.

<p>The village of Kinderhook is located along the old Albany/New York Post Road (Route 9). One of its main cross streets is called "Albany Avenue," - the home of the <a href="http://www.berkshire.net/OnlineArchives/columbia/cchs.html">Columbia County Historical Society</a>.</p>
