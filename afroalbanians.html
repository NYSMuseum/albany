<p><font size=+1><b>A</b>mong the most often discussed yet least understood parts of the early Albany story concern the roles of those of African ancestry in the growth and development of the pre-industrial city.
 
<p>The <i><a href="whoarewe.html">Colonial Albany Social History Project</a></i> 
  is making a <a href="specialeffort.html">special effort</a> to look for and 
  not overlook Afro Albanians in the historical record. This initiative is ongoing 
  and has begun to yield new information on early Albany's African ancestry community. 
  Our overall goal is to develop a biography for each person who lived in the 
  pre-industrial city - Afro Albanians definitely included!
  
<p><a href="#dinnah"><img SRC="images/jpg/dinnah.jpg" ALT="Image of Dinnah Jackson" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=1 BORDER=1 height=140 align=LEFT></a>The 
  lives of <a href="bios/j/djackson1074.html">Dinnah Jackson</a> - Albany's first 
  African ancestry matriarch; <a href="bios/l/blattimore8200.html">Benjamin Lattimore</a> 
  - a Revolutionary war soldier; and Captain <a href="bios/s/sschuyler8492.html">Samuel 
  Schuyler</a> - a skipper and entrepreneur, represent our hope for making the 
  African presence a regular part of the <a href="art/art-ote.html">early Albany 
  story</a>.
  
<p>This story dates from the earliest days of the community's life. Slavery was 
  an integral feature of Albany's first 200 years. Beginning during the New Netherland 
  period, and becoming widespread during the latter part of the eighteenth century, 
  slavery lasted until 1827 when it finally was eradicated by law in New York 
  State. We believe that slavery in Albany reached its peak in <a href="census1790.html">1790</a> 
  when 572 slaves were counted as residents - placing at least one African ancestry 
  person in almost a third of the city's 573 households.
  
          <p><a href="bios/vr/boy.html"><img src="images/jpg/boyvr.jpg" height=104 width=80 align=right vspace=4 hspace=3 border=1 alt="symbolic representation of the greater Albany slave populace"></a> 
            Colonial censuses provide some data on the African presence in Albany 
            but little information on Afro Albanian lives. The provincial <a href= "census.html">census 
            of 1697</a> identified a total 23 Negroes (although not by name) in all of immense <a href="albanycounty.html">Albany 
            County</a>. How many of those individuals lived in the city of Albany 
            and how many in the countryside is a question that remains unanswered. 
            Such vagary was characteristic of subsequent enumerating. With only 
            <a href="census1714.html">two exceptions</a>, none of the population 
            surveys taken during the eighteenth century differentiated between 
            slaves living in the city and in the surrounding countryside. Nor 
            did they provide any information on their lives. 

<p>Most of the estimated 1,600 African ancestry people who lived in the city of 
            Albany before 1800 were called slaves. Technically/legally, slaves were the 
            property of an owner. They had no civil rights. They could be and 
            were bought and sold, bequeathed in wills, and were required to perform 
            a wide range of tasks and chores. Because of their dehumanized status, 
            slaves were less frequently mentioned in the mainstream records of 
            the community. 

<p>However, for the eighteenth-century, substantial information on these Afro Albanians has been recovered from core community-based historical resources  whose compilation, processing, and examination comprises the basic research design of the <a href= "whoarewe.html#research"><i>Colonial   Albany Project</i></a>. These historical resources have enabled us to open biographical  files on more than a hundred African ancestry members of the <a href="criteria.html">early Albany community</a> and to develop biographical profiles that we hope can become comparable to what we know about Dinnah Jackson, Benjamin Lattimore, Captain Samuel Schuyler, and many of their neighbors.
  
<p>Our records sweep has yielded important information on a number of enslaved people. The great <a href="fire.html">fire of 1793</a> has enabled us to develop profiles for individuals called <a href="bios/slave/pomp.html">Pomp</a>, "<a href="res/sp.html">D</a>inah," and <a href="bios/slave/bet.html">Bet</a> that otherwise might have been impossible.
   
<p>An <a href="art/art-jls.html">Internet version</a> of a published article further explains the emergence of an Afro-Albanian middle class in the decades following the American Revolution.
  
<p>At this point, we have been most successful in presenting some sources and summarizing current thought related to the general topic of <a href="res/pinkster.html">Pinkster</a> in early Albany history.
  
<p><a name=vis></a><a href="res/visitors.html">Visitors</a> to early Albany remarked 
  on the "slave," "colored," or "negro" population of Albany and its environs. 
  The observations of <a href="bios/m/annemcvickar.html">Anne Grant</a> and others 
  are truly <a href="art/grant.html#aa">fascinating</a> but difficult to reconcile 
  with the existing community record - meaning more study is needed!</p>
<p>Because the project accepts new information on the people of colonial Albany 
  on a daily basis, the 16,000 <a href="pcalhindex.html#biographies">biographical 
  profiles</a> in our community data base continue to evolve as the more we learn, 
  the more we might understand, and the more we can hope to know. That axiom rings 
  particularly true for the Afro Albanians. This page provides basic access to 
  their stories.</p>
