<p><a href="#districts"><img src="images/jpg/maps/albany1772.jpg" align=right width=300 height=351 border=+1 alt="diagram showing Albany County districts about 1772" hspace=4 vspace=4></a><b>A</b>lbany was one of the <a href="#counties">twelve original counties</a> of colonial New York as established by Governor <a href="bios/d/thdongan.html">Thomas Dongan</a> in 1683. This page provides basic definitions and access to <i>Albany's</i> essential parts and historical narratives. Please understand that the core of our <a href="na/na.html">concern</a> is the <a href="criteria.html">people</a> of the city of Albany as distinct from its hinterland.</p>

<p>By definition, Albany County initially was to "<a href="res/sp.html">con</a>taine the Towns of Albany, the Collony Renslaerwyck, Schonecteda, and all the villages, neighborhoods, and Christian Plantacons on the east side of Hudson River from Roelof Jansen's Creeke, and on the west side from Sawyer's Creeke to the Sarraghtoga." In time, its boundary lines would become more closely defined!</p>

<p>But practically speaking, until the late 1760s, most people thought of Albany County as the entire upriver region of the province. Any more precise definition of its boundaries was the subject of much discussion, uncertainty, and controversy involving <a href="yankinv.html">Yankees</a> and Yorkers, the <a href="bios/french.html">Fr</a>ench, other European settlers, and 
<a href="bios/indians.html">Native peoples</a> - original settlers of the entire region. However, Albany's expansive and amorphous nature is portrayed graphically on a number of contemporary <a href="pcalhindex.html#map">maps</a> - particularly those representing the region in <a href="map/johnsonmap.html">1771</a> and <a href="im/imsauthier.html">1776</a>.</p>

<p>For the entire colonial period, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River">Hudson River</a> was the defining and unifying physical feature of the region. The objective of virtually all <a href="art/art-rpea.html">trade and travel</a> was to reach and/or use the Hudson. 

<p>Albany County was composed of a number of political subdivisions. Located on a <a href="im/imsauthier.html">map of the province</a> dated 1776, they included the <a href="earlycity.html">City of Albany</a>, the Manor of <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> (later split into <a href="na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> (then Colonie), <a href="na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>,         the hilltowns, and the East Manor), the town or borough of <a href="na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, 
        the village of <a href="na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>, <a href="na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>, 
        Livingston Manor, <a href="na/sarapat.html">Sara</a>toga, <a href="na/hoos.html">Hoosick</a>, 
        Great Imboght, Catskill and Coxsackie, Schoharie, Claverack, <a href="yankinv.html">K</a>ing's 
        District, <a href="bios/ger.html#pal">German</a> Camp, and Cambridge. 
      <p><a href="na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a> was an informal entity from the early eighteenth century and erected as a town in 1788. <a href="na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> or "the New City" was known separately from the 1770s.</p>

<p><a name=new></a>In the decade prior to the <a href="or/or-3r.html">Revolution</a>, three new counties [ named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryon_County,_New_York">Tryon</a> (Mohawk basin and Adirondacks), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_County,_Province_of_New_York">Charlotte</a> (Adirondacks and Lake Champlain), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester_County,_New_York">Gloucester</a> (much of the Hampshire Grants - today's Vermont) ] were taken off and established from the newly settled lands in the western and northern parts of original Albany County. However, the latter two especially, were sparsely settled until after the <a href="or/or-3r.html">war</a> - even though relatives and associates of important Albany <a href="cityfathers.html">personages</a> held title to much of the <a href="res/realestate.html">best acreage</a>.</p> 

<p>Even so, in 1774, Albany County was the most <a href="populationny.html">populated county</a> in colonial New York with 42,706 settlers. In <a href="census1790.html">1790</a>, the count had reached 75,921 inhabitants and it still was the most populated county in what now was New York State. By 1800, Albany County had achieved its present boundaries as Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Greene, and Columbia Counties had been split off from it. Albany County was now confined to the west side of the Hudson River and south of the Mohawk. Consequently, its population had dipped to 25,155 people!</p>

<p>For most of the colonial period, the city and county of Albany sent two and then three delegates to the Provincial <a href="org/ass.html">Assembly</a>. Rensselaerswyck and later Schenectady (beginning in 1726) also were allowed one delegate each. From its earliest days, the <a href="albanymilitia.html">Albany County militia</a> was composed of residents of the county's communities and was organized by locale. 


<p>The <a href="stateoftheart.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a> is focused on the people who founded and built the <a href="criteria.html"><b>CITY</b></a> of Albany during its formative years. However, we understand that the city story cannot be separated from that of its hinterland! This page will provide access to information and issues relating to the <a href="criteria.html">people of colonial Albany</a> and, where necessary and feasible, including the larger county set in the surrounding countryside.</p>

<p><a name=districts></a>This very useful and handy diagram map entitled <b>Albany 
        Districts in 1772</b> accompanying an article by David Kendall Martin 
        entitled "Districts of Albany County, New York, 1772–1784," was previously 
        published in <a href="sources.html#nygbr"><i>NYGBR</i></a> (Fall 1990). 
        In 2012, it appears to have been taken off-line. However, it WAS available
