<p>On August 14, 1685, before me, <a href="../bios/b/jobecker6031.html">John Becker</a>, residing in Albany, Notary Public, appeared <a href="../bios/g/jaglen4926.html">Jacob Sanders Glen</a>, living in Albany, sicke and being a bed, but fully using his understanding.

      <p>He makes his present wife <a href="../bios/w/cawitbeck1708.html">Catharine</a> 
        his sole heir and executor, of all lands, money, gold and silver, coyned 
        and uncoyned, jewels and precious things. And although he hath four children 
        begotten by his said wife, viz., <a href="../bios/g/joglen4932.html">Johanes</a>, 
        aged about 10, <a href="../bios/g/anglen4917.html">Anake</a>, 8, Jacob, 
        6, and <a href="../bios/g/heglen4922.html">Helena</a>, 2 years, and his 
        wife be not troubled by the orphan masters, Trustees, Constables, the 
        Court of the Town, or any other in power, or any Court Judge that they 
        shall not (excepting the respect due to them) in no ways to intermeddle 
        with the children or estate. But she may not sell the lands, and when 
        the children come of age she shall fit them out comfortably. His lands 
        at <a href="../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and the house where 
        he now lives are to remain for his children. The lands at Schenectady 
        are mentioned as in possession and under the care of his two brothers 
        Sander and Johanes Glen. 
      <p>Witnesses, <a href="../bios/t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wessels</a> Ten Broeck, <a href="../bios/w/jowendell2942.html">John Wendel</a>, <a href="../bios/l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a>.
