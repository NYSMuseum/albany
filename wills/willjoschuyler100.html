<font face=arial>
<p>In the name of God, Amen. I, Colonel <a href="../bios/s/joschuyler100.html">John Schuyler</a>, of Albany, being in perfect health. I leave to my son, <a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1747.html">Philip Schuyler</a>, my grist mill at Saratoga, for his right of primogeniture, reserving to the children of my son, <a href="../bios/s/joschuyler1428.html">John Schuyler</a>, deceased, the right to grind free of toll; Also my dwelling <a href="../loc/schuylerhouse.html">house</a> in Albany, with the ground, except 5 feet wide on the South side next to the house of my son John.

<p>I also leave to my son Philip, ½ of my undivided 1/7 of my lands in the <a href="../na/sarapat.html">Patent of Saratoga</a>, which with the farm and saw mill I value at £890. And he is to pay to my daughters, <a href="../bios/s/mgtschuyler.html">Margaret Schuyler</a>, and <a href="../bios/s/caschuyler1244.html">Catalentie Cuyler</a>, each £50.

<p>Whereas I released to my son, John Schuyler, deceased; by deed, October 21,1739, a certain tract of 160 acres, or 80 morgen, being the farm then in his possession; And whereas there is a certain parcel of woodland, to the same on the south side, containing 8 or 10 acres, I bequeath the same to his heirs. “I leave to my grand daughter <a href="../bios/s/mgtschuyler.html">Margare</a>, wife of Colonel <a href="../bios/s/phschuyler.html">Philip Schuyler</a>, the <a href="../bios/s/elsstaats99.html#portrait">large Picture</a> of my most <a href="../bios/s/elsstaats99.html">beloved wife</a> and my self, drawn in one piece, and in one frame.” I leave to my daughter Catalentie, wife of Cornelius Cuyler, my large Holland case or linen Press. I leave the rest of my household furniture to my children, and to my stepdaughter <a href="../bios/w/sawendell.html">Sara</a>, wife of Jacob Glen. I leave to my two daughters, £475, and all the rest of my estate to my sons and daughters.
