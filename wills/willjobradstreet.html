            <p><b>"T</b>his is the last will and testament of <a href="../bios/b/jobradstreet.html">John 
              Bradstreet<a/>, Major General in his Majesty's Army, as follows." 
              I appoint Col. </a></a><a/><a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
              Schuyler</a> to take all my books and papers and to settle and transmit 
              my public accounts to Charles Gould, Esq., of London. And I discharge 
              the said Col. Schuyler from all demands and debts, except &pound1000, 
              "which shall be paid to Elizabeth Bradstreet, daughter to my wife." 
              I leave to <a href="../bios/s/jobrschuyler.html">John Bradstreet 
              Schuyler</a>, son of said Col. Schuyler, the farm of which I have 
              a lease in fee, and is now possessed by <a href="../bios/t/jotunn1683.html">Tonycliff</a>; 
              also my army books and apparell.</a></p>
            <a/> 
            <p>I leave all my horses and carriages to <a href="../bios/vr/cavr.html">Mrs. 
              Schuyler</a>, wife of said Col. Schuyler, "and I give to his daughter, 
              <a href="../bios/s/mgtschuyler1490.html">Margaret Schuyler</a>, 
              all the money due to me from Parson Johnson, of Corrys Bush." All 
              the rest of my estate, real and personal, I leave to my two daughters, 
              but they are to pay to their mother &pound100 sterling yearly. I 
              empower my executors to make partition of my landed estate, and 
              to sell for the benefit of my daughters. I leave Doctor Bruce &pound100, 
              for his trouble and kindness to me. My watch I give to Mr. Gould, 
              as a mark of my friendship. "I leave Funeral expenses to the Discretion 
              of my executors." I appoint for executors, Col. Philip Schuyler 
              and William Smith, Esq., "who penned this will according to my dictate."</p>
