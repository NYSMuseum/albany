<p>
I, <a href="../bios/w/pwraxall.html">Peter Wraxall</a>, of New York, being in health." I leave to my honored father and friend, Mr. John Wraxall, of Bristol, England, £20. To my sister, Ann Wraxall, "by my father's first wife, and my own mother," £400. To my sister Mary, £50. If my sister Ann should die, then I leave the £400 to my niece Elizabeth, daughter of my brother Richard. "I leave to my worthy and much esteemed friend, Sir <a href="../bios/j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>, Baronet, £20, to be laid out in any little reminder of our uninterrupted friendship." 

<p>All the rest of my estate I leave to my most excellent and dearly beloved wife Elizabeth, whom I make executor." "And were it not for the circumstances of my sister Ann and my niece Elizabeth, I would have been guided by superior affection and left all to my wife."

<p>"I desire I may be buried without any kind of expence which may border upon ostentation. If my fortune would permit it, I should be greatly an Enemy to all the Glowing Pomp."

<p>[This will is not signed or sealed; no witnesses.] Ann Dewine, wife of Philip Dewine, of New York, being sworn, testifies that she is the sister of Elizabeth Wraxall, wife of Peter Wraxall, and gave much of her time in attendance upon him in his sickness, of which he died. And in search among his papers the above document was found, and that it is in his handwriting, which she well knows. Sworn, September 10, 1759.

<br>John Watts and Beverley Robinson both testify that they are well acquainted with the handwriting of Peter Wraxall, deceased, and believe the above paper to be wholly written by him.
 
 <p>Confirmed by Governor James De Lancey, and the widow, Elizabeth Wraxall, confirmed as executrix, September 10, 1759.
