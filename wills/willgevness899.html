<p>“Whereas on December 6, in the 6th year of Queen Anne, I in conjunction with my wife, <a href="../bios/t/mateller6616.html">Margery Van Ness</a>, made our will, and did among other things bequeath to <a href="../bios/va/wivallen5687.html">William Van Ale</a>, of Albany, all the clothing, jewels, silver, etc., which formerly belonged to his mother, and all the rest to the said William Van Ale, and to Jannettie, wife of Lawrence Van Schaick. And since the death of my wife, the said William Van Ale, in making up his accounts is in debt to me £118 16s and he is willing to discharge the said account and is also willing to have of me the further sum of £29, and one great wheelwright augur. And in consideration of my discharging him from said will, and did release to me all of said property. I leave to my niece, <a href="../bios/o/mayoo686.html">Maryke</a>, wife of Thomas Hermanse, of Albany, all my part of said estate. Also all the clothes provided that Jannettie, wife of Lawrence Van Schaick of Kinderhook, shall have the same value. I leave to William Van Ale my two great wheelwright augurs. 

<p>I make Jannettie, wife of Lawrence Van Schaick, and Maryke, wife of Thomas Harme, executors.
