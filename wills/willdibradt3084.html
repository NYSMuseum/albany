After the death of my wife I leave [one-third] of all the rest of my estate to my son Peter, and [one-third] to my daughter Tryntie, wife of Jacob De Forrest, and [one-third] to my two grandsons, Jesse and Dirck De Forrest. 

<p>I make my wife Catrina [he meant Cornelia] and my sons, Peter and <a href="../bios/vs/stvsvoort6730.html">Staats Van Voort</a>, executors.
