<p>In the name of God, Amen. Know all men by the contents of this present public instrument that in the year after the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 1684, on the 9th day of July, before me, <a href="../bios/vi/ajvilp.html">Adriaen van Ilpendam</a>, notary public (residing in New Albany in America), and before the hereinafter named witnesses, came and appeared the worthy <a href="../bios/vkl/javlaer6695.html">Jacob Gerritsz van Laer</a>, born in the manor of Ruynen also dwelling here in New Albany, well known to me, the notary, being at present a little sick of body, but able to be about and to all appearances of sound mind, memory and understanding, which appearer, considering the shortness and frailty of human life, the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the time and hour thereof and wishing therefore to dispose of his temporal effects to be left behind while he yet (through God's grace) may be able, and which he does of his own free will and motion, without persuasion or misleading of anyone, has now ordained and determined this his last will and testament in form and manner following.

<p>First and foremost commending his immortal soul (whenever it shall be separated from his body) to the gracious and merciful hands of God, his Creator and Savior, and his body to a Christian burial, this appearer and testator declares hereby that he has nominated and instituted as the sole and universal heirs of all his effects to be left behind, claims and credits, nothing in the world excepted, which he shall leave whether here in this country or elsewhere, his brothers and sisters or if deceased their children in their parents' place; his oldest brother is named Jan Gerritsz van Laer, his oldest sister is named Grietie Gerrits, the second sister is named Albertie Gerrits, the third sister is named Juditie Gerrits, the fourth sister is named Roelofie Gerrits, and the children left by his late sister Geertie Gerrits jointly in their mother's place, and his youngest brother named Egbert Gerrits van Laer, and the son of his late sister Annetie Gerrits named Gerrit Jansz Ruytingh. The testator hereby bequeaths to his aforesaid brothers and sisters or if any of them be deceased their children left behind  in their father's or mother's place, to each one his or her just legitimate portion of the residue of his estate, provided that the children left by his sister Geertie Gerrits shall first draw out one hundred guilders Holland money, over and above their aforenamed legitimate portion. 

<p>Finally he, the testator, has appointed and authorized as the lawful executors of this will and administrators of his estate the worthy <a href="../bios/v/jadvinhagen3420.html">Jan Vynaghen</a>, at present elder of this <a href="../drc.html">Reformed Church</a>, and the worthy <a href="../bios/c/macregier5312.html">Maerten Crygier, junior</a>, and therefore this testator gives and grants to the same, his chosen executors and administrators, such ample power and authority as by law and usage belongs to all testamentary executors and administrators, provided they shall receive their proper compensation for services rendered according to the customs of this country, and provided also that all magistrates and other authorities, whoever they may be, are fully and advisedly excluded, desiring that the same shall not have the least direction over the estate, but hereby excusing the same herefrom and beforehand declining their services; and in case he, the testator, hereafter, either in writing over his own hand and signature, or by word of mouth before two or more trustworthy witnesses, make any other bequests or legacies, or further disposition, or any changes, amplifications or restrictions in the aforesaid provisions, he wills and desires that these may have the same force and effect and by every one be so held and esteemed as if they had been written and set forth in this his will. 

<p>All that is hereinbefore written the testator declares to be his last will and testament, desiring that the same, after his decease, may have full force and effect, be it as will, codicil, donation, gift in anticipation of death, or otherwise, as shall seem most suitable, notwithstanding that certain formalities required by law and usage may not have been fully observed herein; desiring that the fullest benefit hereof may be enjoyed and that one or more copies hereof in proper form may be made and delivered as occasion may require.

<p>This done in New Albany at the house of the appearer and testator and by the aforesaid testator with his own hand subscribed (in presence of the worthy Mr Gerard Swart and the worthy Gerrit Bancker, called as trustworthy witnesses hereto), in New Albany, the year, month and day aforesaid.
