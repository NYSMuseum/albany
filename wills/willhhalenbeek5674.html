<p><b>I</b>n the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/h/hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrik Halenbeek</a> of the city of Albany and province of New York, Yeoman, being weak in body; but of sound and perfect mind and memory, blessed be Almighty God for the same, do make and publish this my last <a href="#will">will</a> and testament, in manner and form following (that is to say) 
<p>First I give and bequeath to my son <a href="../bios/h/ishallenbeck5282.html">Isaac Halenbeek</a> the sum of ten shillings current money of New York, for his birthright, and as a barr to his being my heir-at-law.

<p> Item - I give, bequeath and devise unto my beloved wife <a href="../bios/b/subradt4279.html">Susannah Halenbeek</a> the mean profits, use and income of all my estate both real and personal during her natural life, and after her decease I give devise and bequeath unto my eight children (to wit) <a href="../bios/h/ishallenbeck5282.html">Isaac halenbeck</a>, <a href="../bios/h/dohallenbeck5259.html">Dorothy Halenbeek</a>, <a href="../bios/h/elhallenbeck.html">Elizabeth</a>, the wife of William Helling, <a href="../bios/h/dahallenbeck5256.html">Daniel Halenbeek</a>, <a href="../bios/h/gehallenbeck5271.html">Garrit Halenbeek</a>, <a href="../bios/h/jahallenbeck.html">Jacob</a> Halenbeek, <a href="../bios/h/anthallenbeck5247.html">Anthony Halenbeek</a> and <a href="../bios/h/behallenbeck5249.html">Bernardus</a> Halenbeek, all the rest and residue of my estate both real and personal of what name and nature so ever, and wheresoever the same may be, to be equally divided among them;  to them my said children each an eighth part and to their heirs and assigns forever - and in case my son Isaac Halenbeek should not return, then my will is that his three children (to wit) Hendrik, <a href="../bios/h/nihallenbeck5233.html">Nicholas</a> and Daniel shall succeed their father in this inheritance in equal proportion; saving unto Hendrik the ten shillings bequeathed to his father for his birthright &c.</p>

<p>My express will and desire also is and I do hereby order and direct that the <a name=burying></a><a href="../loc/hallbg.html">burying ground</a> in my lott, near my house, containing sixty feet square shall be and remain as such for the use of all my children and their posterity; which is to be kept in a sufficient fence at their joint expense, and such of my children or their posterity that shall refuse to pay their part in such repairs, or keeping the said burying ground within a good fence, shall from henceforth be excluded their right therein.</p>

<p> I do also order and direct and my express will is, that if any of my children shall come to die before they receive the benefit of this my last will and testament not having any lawful issue begotten of their body, his her or their parts shall be equally divided among my surviving children their heirs or assigns; and in like manner in case one of my grandchildren (sons of my son Isaac) who in all cases represent their father during his absence should die before he comes to be of age, the survivors shall equally share the deceased's part.

<p>Lastly I do hereby constitute my eight above named children Executors of this my last will and testament hereby revoking all former wills and testaments by me made. In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal the Nineteenth day of November in the fifth year of his Majesty George the third's Reign and in the year of our Lord Christ, One thousand seven hundred and sixty four.</p>
