<p><a href="#online">WILL</a> OF JOHANNES WENDEL, OF ALBANY. 

<p>In the name of God Amen., the Twenty-third day of November, 1691, in the Third Year of our most Sovereign Lord and Lady, William and Mary, by the Grace of God, of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, King and Queen, I, <a href="../bios/w/jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendel</a>, of the City of Albany, Merchant, although weak and sickly in body, yet of good, perfect and sound Memory, praised be Almighty God therefor, do Make and Ordain this my present Will and Testament, in manner and form following; that is to say : 

<p>First I commend myself and all my Whole Estate to the Mercy and Protection of Almighty God, being fully Persuaded by His Holy Spirit, through the Death and Passion of Jesus Christ, to obtain full Pardon 
and Remission of all my sins, and to inherit everlasting life, to which, the Holy Trinity, one coequal Deity, be all Honor and Glory forever, Amen. And Touching such Temporal Estate of Lands, Houses, Goods, Chattels and Debts, as the Lord hath been pleased, (far beyond my Deserts), to Bestow upon me, I do Order, Give, Bequeath and Dispose the same in manner and form following : 

      <p>my Will is that my well-beloved wife, <a href="../bios/s/elsstaats99.html">Elizabeth 
        Wendel</A>, shall Have and Keep, Hold and Possess my Whole Estate, both 
        Lands, Houses, Lots, Goods and Chattels, and all my moveables during her 
        Natural Life, out of which she is to Bring up, Educate and Maintain my 
        Eleven Children, vizt: <a href="../bios/w/elswendell2795.html">Elsie</a> 
        and Mary Wendel, begotten by my first wife Marytje Jillisse (Meyer), to 
        which two daughters my Wife is to pay as soon as they come to Age, or 
        to be Married, Three Hundred and-forty Beavers, and the other moveables 
        due to them for their Mother's Portion, or Inheritance, according to the 
        Instrument made thereof, which I Will shall take its Effect to all Intents 
        and Purposes, and moreover have an Equal Share of my Estate with my Other 
        Children, and also to Bring up, Educate and Maintain my Nine Children 
        begotten by Elizabeth, my Present Wife, called <a href="../bios/w/abwendell2654.html">Abraham</a>, 
        <a href="../bios/w/suwendell2719.html">Susanna</a>, <a href="../bios/w/cawendell2767.html">Catalyntje</a>,

        and <a href="../bios/w/jawendell2696.html">Jacob Wendel</a>, and such 
        other Children as it shall Please God to send me by her, until they shall 
        severally come of Age, or to be Married, but if my Wife shall happen to 
        re-marry, then my Will is that she give and Exhibit a Perfect Inventory 
        upon Oath of all the Whole Estate, Real and Personal, which is to be apprised 
        by Indifferent and Judicious Men, and Equally Divided, 
      <p>one Moiety [half or two equal parts] thereof for the Behoof of my said Eleven Children, which half I Will to be Equally Divided among them, or so many of them as shall then be alive; and the other Moiety for my said well-beloved Wife, which Portions of my said Children she is to keep until they come to Age or be Married, she giving sufficient Security for the same. Provided, Lands and Houses be also Apprised and Allotted to my Sons, as hereafter is Specified, they being accountable to the Children what the said Lands shall be Valued above their Proportion in the Estate, viz*: I do Give and Bequeath to my Eldest Son Abraham, and to His Heirs forever, all my Seventh Part of the Land commonly Called <a href="../na/sarapat.html">Saraghtogo</a>, my share being that Farm that lies to the Southward of the Fish Creek, so called, which separates the land of 
Robert Livingston and mine, being Bounded on the South by <a href="../bios/t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirk Wessel's</a>, with my Proportion of Wood-Land belonging thereunto, alway Provided 
the same Be Apprised by Indifferent Persons, when he shall come 
to Age or be Married, he paying the surplusage what it be more valued 
than His Portion with the other Children. I do Give and Bequeath unto 
my son Johannes and to his Heirs forever, all my Land commonly Called 
<a href="../na/lburgh.html">Steen Sable</a>, on the East side of Hudson's River, with all the Houses, Barns, 
Yards and other appurtenances, the Island called Walvisch Island and that 
Belongs to said tract of Land, which is to be Apprised when he comes to 
Age, and if the apprisement amounts to more than his Equal Share in my 
Estate, he is to pay it to my other Children to make them equal. I do 
Give and Bequeath to my Son Ephraim and to His Heirs forever, all my 
Part, Share and Portion of the land Called Bleukenburgh, both at the Strand 
and upon the Flatts or Plains, which is Also to be Apprised, as the other 
Lands above mentioned, and if the apprisement amounts to more than the 
Equal Proportion in said Estate, he is to pay it to my other Children, to 
make them Equal with him. My Will is further, that if any of the said 
Tracts of Land Bequeathed to my Sons aforesaid should happen to be apprised 
less than their Portion in the Estate, that so much of the Estate be 
paid to them as to make it up with the rest of the Children.

<p>I do Give unto my well-beloved Wife, my House which I now live in, situate and being between the widow of Jacob Glen and Peter Davidtse Schuyler, which is to be apprised and deducted out of the Moiety of the Estate which she is to have; and if she remains a Widow, she is to Keep, Hold, Enjoy and Possess the Whole Estate during her Natural Life, and to Give to my said 
Children such Portions and Outfitts as she shall see meet when they come to Age, or to be Married, and after my Wife's decease the Whole Estate, Real and Personal, to be Equally Divided among my Sons and Daughters, 

<p>Excepting that I do give to my Eldest Son, Abraham, the Sum of Three Pounds current money of this Province, besides his Portion with the Rest 
of my Children, wherewith he is to Rest Satisfied of any Pretence that he 
might make as my Eldest Son, and share then as the others do, and
