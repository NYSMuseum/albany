      <p>In the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/s/jastaats4595.html">Jacob Staats</a>, 
        of the city of Albany, <a href="../trades/medical.html">Chirurgeon</a>, being very sick. I leave to my wife 
        <a href="../bios/r/irlydius4613.html">Isabella</a>, my house and lot where 
        we do now live, together with the lot near the creek, during her life 
        or widowhood, and then to my daughter <a href="../bios/s/destaats4565.html">Deborah</a>; and she is to pay my grandson, 
        Jacobus Van Schaick, &pound25.

<p>I leave to my 2 daughters, <a href="../bios/s/destaats4565.html">Deborah</a>, wife 
        of Henderick Roseboom, and <a href="../bios/s/castaats4574.html">Catharine</a>, widow of Goesen Van Schaick, all 
        that certain meadow or pasture, in the city of Albany, near the <a href="../loc/fortorange.html">Old 
        Fort</a>, joining to the road that leads from the city to the said Old 
        Fort. Also another pastures near the same and adjoining the pasture of 
        <a href="../bios/vi/wavi2500.html">Warner Van Juren</a> and <a href="../bios/v/bavisscher4102.html">Bastain Hermense</a>. My wife is to have one wagonload of hay yearly from said meadow. The north end of the first pasture shall be set with a good fence from east to west bounds, so far as to include the graves which now are. Which part being fenced shall forever remain for a Burying place for such persons for whom my daughters and their heirs shall give liberty. I leave to my said daughters all my right to the estate of my father, <a href="../bios/s/abstaats4551.html">Major Abraham Staats</a>, viz, Lot No. 6, and whatsoever shall fall to me by division.

<p> To my wife and daughters all personal property, and to my grandson Jacobus Van Schaick, 
        all apparel. And whereas I made a contract with my wife before marriage, 
        dated January 3, 1710/11, the same is to be kept.</p>
