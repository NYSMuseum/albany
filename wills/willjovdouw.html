<font face=arial>

<p>In the name of God, Amen. Be it known and manifest unto all People by these Presents that I, <a href="../bios/d/jovdouw2092.html">Johannes Val. Douw</a>, of Albany County, being weak and sick in my body, am minded to dispose of my temporal estate with which God has blessed me, December 13, 1777.

<p>I will that after my decease my son Cornelius shall have £20 for his birthright. I leave to my son Cornelius all my <a href="../res/realestate.html">real</a> and personal estate, my house and lot in Albany, and all my lots in <a href="../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, and all my right I have in Sandgate, and all other lands and tenements of whatever nature.

      <p>I will that my daughter, Margaretje Douw, shall have a Christian like and decent 
        maintenance, such as her effects require. I also give her all her <a href="../bios/b/jabogert6068.html">mother’s</a> 
        wearing apparel. And she is to be maintained by my son Cornelius, and 
        if he refuses or neglects, then I leave her £600. 
      <p>I make my son Cornelius and my nephew, Valcker Oothourt, executors.</p>

<p>Witnesses: <a href="../bios/b/hebogert6096.html">Hendrick Bogert</a> (probably his brother-in-law) , <a href="../bios/o/heoo430.html">Henry Oothout jun.</a>, <a href="../bios/z/jozab6985.html">Ino. Jost Zabriskie</a>.
