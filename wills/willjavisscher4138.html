<p>In the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/v/javisscher4138.html">Jacob Visher</a>, of Albany, being of sound mind. All debts to be paid. I leave to <a href="../bios/s/geswitts5659.html">Gertrude Swits</a>, daughter of Major <a href="../bios/s/isswitts5661.html">Isaac Swits</a>, the house and lot where I now live, “and she is to keep and maintain my Negro wench, ‘Deijaen,’ with food and clothing, and allow her to store her clothing in the [g]arret during her life, and to live in the back kitchen and sleep in the cellar.”

<p>I leave to <a href="../bios/vv/gevvr.html">Gerritt Van Vrankie</a>, carpenter, of Albany, £100. Of all the rest of the real and personal estate I leave 1/3 to the heirs of my sister (then deceased), <a href="../bios/v/hevisscher4076.html">Hester Swits</a>, viz., Isaac, <a href="../bios/s/suswitts.html">Susanah</a>, wife of <a href="../bios/vn/covness889.html">Cornelius Van Ness</a>, and <a href="../bios/s/answitts5649.html">Anna</a>, wife of Hendrick Beekman; 1/6 to the children and Egbert; 1/6 to <a href="../bios/e/maegberts4530.html">Polly</a>, wife of Jacob J. Lansing, and 1/3 to <a href="../bios/v/gevisscher4071.html">Gertrude</a>, wife of Martin Beekman. My Negro man and woman are to be free, and my executors are to give security that they shall not be a burden upon any town, according to Act passed October 29, 1730.

<p>I make Isaac Swits, Jacob J. Lansing, and John Beekman executors, and I give to each of them £50 for their trouble. Dated November 10, 1762.</p>
