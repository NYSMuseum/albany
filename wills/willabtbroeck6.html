Some spelling, punctuation, and paragraphing adjustments infused for clarity. In addition, SB has made some judgements or <a href="../../res/guess.html">guesses</a> regarding the more indistinct and thus puzzling words or passages in this not completely legible copy of the document which seems to be in a secretary's hand rather than in that of the testator.
