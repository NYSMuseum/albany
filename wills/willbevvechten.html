<p>In the name of God, Amen, April 15, 1748. I, <a href="../bios/vv/bevvechten2393.html">Benjamin Van Vechten</a>, of Albany, merchant Taylor, being sick. I leave to my son <a href="../bios/vv/antvvechten2392.html">Anthony</a> the £50 left to me by my <a href="#father">father</a> in his will, which is to be paid by my brother <a href="../bios/vv/tevvechten2572.html">Tunis</a> some years after the death of my mother. And whereas my mother, <a href="../bios/l/mgtlievers.html">Grietie Van Vechten</a>, hath made over to me an obligation for £200, dated July 31, 1739, and payable May 1, 1740, under the hand and seal of my father, Harmen Van Vechten, deceased, I leave ½ of the same to my son Anthony, and also all my houses and real estate. If she dies under age, then as follows: To Alida Fonda, daughter of my late sister Annettie, wife  of Hendrick Fonda, £50 when of age or married. To my brother Tunis £50. To my wife <a href="../bios/b/anbogardus2387.html">Anetie</a> £50. I leave ½ of the said bond to my brother <a href="../bios/vv/havvechten2520.html">Harmen</a>. I leave to my wife all the rest of my movables. To my brother Tunis my wearing apparel. 

<p>I make my wife, and my friend, <a href="../bios/l/gelansing3706.html">Gerritt G. Lansingh</a>, cooper executors.

<p>Witnesses, Anthony Bret, <a href="../bios/r/ahroseboom1533.html">Ahus Roseboom</a>, <a href="../bios/vd/jovdh5697.html">Johanes  Vanderheyden</a>.

<p>Proved, July 6, 1757.

<p><a name=father><b>Father:</b> We are aware of the potential conflict in the names of his father within this document. But based on the names of his siblings, we approach believing  this Benjamin Van Vechten was the son of <a href="../bios/vv/divvechten.html">Dirck C.</a> and not Harmanus Van Vechten.
