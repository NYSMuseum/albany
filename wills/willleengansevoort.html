<p><b>I</b>n the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/g/leegansevoort4656.html">Leendert Gansevort</a>, of Albany, brewer, of sound mind. I direct all debts and funeral charges to be paid. I leave to my wife <a href="../bios/d/cadewandelaer6167.html">Catharine</a> all real and personal estate during her life or widowhood, but not to dispose of the same, but have the income. After her death I bequeath to <a href="../bios/g/hagansevoort4662.html">Harme Gansevort</a> a silver Tankard, as being my eldest son, and heir. After the death of my wife I leave to my sister, <a href="#maria">Maria Gansevort</a>, 25 pounds yearly, and she is to reside with either of my children she may choose, “and she is to pay that amount to the child she lives with, as a recompense for maintaining her, during all the days of her natural life.” I leave to my son <a href="../bios/g/jogansevoort4665.html">Johanes</a> a Negro man. I leave to my son <a href="../bios/g/pegansevoort4670.html">Peter</a> the house and lot where he now lives, with the appurtenances. Also 900 pounds. All the rest of my estate to my sons Harme and Johanes, and they are to pay to my son Peter the sum of 900 pounds, and I make my two sons executors. Dated, September 1762.</p>

<p><a name=maria></a><b>Maria Gansevoort</b>: Identified as the sister of the testator, this  individual <a href="../inprog.html">has not been linked</a> to qualitative information (According to <a href="../books.html#apkgans">Alice Kenney</a> (p.29), she appears to have died unmarried but at an advanced age. <a href="../res/guess.html">Thus</a>, she would have been the daughter of the Albany patriarchs whose children all were born before 1690.) Not knowing if this is the only reference to her, at this point, we hesitate to offer a further <a href="../res/bios.html#note">note</a> on her life. </p></font size>
