<p>Benjamin Fletcher, Governor, etc. To all, etc. Know ye that at New York the 
27 day of April, 1697, the last will of JACOB TELLER, annexed, was proved, 
and Letters of Administration granted to his wife Christina. 

<p>In the name of God, Amen. Know all men by these 
presents that I, <a href="../bios/t/jateller6611.html">Jacob Teller</a>, being sickly abed, but of good and perfect 
memory, considering the mortality of all men, have, with due deliberation, 
made my last will." Leaves all estate to his wife Christina and child Anna 
Margaret. "Which estate shall be accounted as movables, any law or statute to 
the contrary notwithstanding," and to be disposed of by my executors. All to 
remain in possession of his wife till his child is of age or marries. I 
appoint, as tutors and guardians of my child, my beloved brother, Wm. Teller, 
Jr., and my father-in-law, (should be brother-in-laws as Richard and Isaac 
were married to Christina's sisters Maria and Aeltje) Richard Ashfield, and 
Isaac De Reimer. Makes his wife executor. 

<p>In testimony, etc., I have set my hand in New York, this 17 day of August, 1696.
