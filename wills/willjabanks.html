<p>In the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/b/jabanks7199.html">JAMES BANKS</a>, of Albany, Gent., being sick in body. I leave to Mary Price, widow of Mr. <a href="../bios/p/joprice1961.html">John Price</a>, late of Albany, Gent., £20. I leave to my son-in-law, James Garrett, alias Banks, of Newark, New Jersey, 20 shillings, in bar of all claims he may have to my estate, by virtue of any former will by me made. 

<p>I leave to my executors all my house and lot, being 1.5 acres, in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, and all my house and lot in Newark, being 3 acres, and all my house and lot situate near the Fort in <a href="../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, in Albany County, and now in the possession of the widow <a href="../bios/s/sixberry.html">Saxburg</a>, and my negro girl, and my horse, clock, watch, sword, fuzee, arms and pistols, my pictures, wearing apparell, and household stuff; and all these are to be sold by them.

All these my executors are to collect and put at interest for the benefit of my nephew, John Banks, son of my brother Abraham Banks, of Youchell, in Ireland, to whom I give all the rest of my estate. In case of his death, it is to go to my nephew, Edward Banks, son of my brother, William Banks. 

<p>I leave to the <a href="#church">Ch</a>urch in Albany, £20, to be laid out either for the purchase of a piece of plate, or towards purchasing a bell.
