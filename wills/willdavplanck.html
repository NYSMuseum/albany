<p>In the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/vp/davplanck.html">David Ver Planck</a>, of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeren_Island">Beeren Island</a>, in the Manor of <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerwyck</a>, being of perfect health this March 13, 1762.

<p>I direct all debts to be paid. I leave to my eldest son, David, "one of my best negroes, to be his own choice, in right of his being my eldest son, thereby excluding him from any further claim."

<p>I leave to my daughter Ariantie all that my lot of ground, being in the First Ward in Albany, on the Plain, Bounded north by the street, south by a Lane, east by Johanes Oostrand, west by heirs of Jan Lansing, being 30 feet wide. 

<p>I leave to my four children, David, Johanes, Ariantie, and Isaac, all the rest of my estate, real and personal, except my farm at Pightwey. 

<p>My will is that my old possession by, and near, the river, where I now live, with the mills and creek, shall never be alienated or disposed of, but shall always remain to my children, or such of them as it shall be allotted to. 

<p>My farm at Pightwey to be sold by my executors, and the money used to pay debts, and the rest to my children. 

<p>I make my cousin, <a href="../bios/vp/phvplanck.html">Philip Ver Planck</a>, of the Manor of Cortlandt, John B. Bleecker, John Beekman, and <a href="../bios/vp/isvplanck1143.html">Isaac Ver Planck</a>, of Albany, executors.

<p>Witnesses, <a href="../bios/f/wmfryer8035.html">William Fryer</a>, baker, Peter Jones, cooper, <a href="../bios/f/isfryer8037.html">Isaac Fryer</a>, weaver.
