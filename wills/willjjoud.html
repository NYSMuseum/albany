<p>In the name of God Amen

<p>The Tenth Day of October in the Twelfth Year of the Reign of our Soverign Lady Anne, by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France and Ireland and in the year of our Lord God, One Thousand Seven Hundred Twelve, I, <a href="../bios/o/jjoud6401.html">John Ouderkirk</a>, of the <a href="../albanycounty.html">County</a> of Albany, being of good health and perfect memory, thanks be to Almighty God for the same, but calling to mind the mortality of my body and knowing that it is appointed for all men once to dye, do make and ordain this my Last Will and Testament - that is to say principally and first of all, I give and recommend my soul into the hands of God that gave it and my body to the earth from whence it came to be buried in a decent and Christian manner, nothing doubting but at the general resurection, I shall receive the same again by the mighty power of God and as touching this worldly estate where with it hath pleased God to bless me in this life, I give, demise and dispose of the same in the following manner and form.

<p>Imprimis, I do give and bequeath unto my eldest son Johannes Ouderkirk, the sum of six shillings in Right of Primogenture, whom I Will, shall make no further claim upon whats hereafter bequeathed to him.

<p>Secondly, I do give unto my grandson, John Ouderkirk, son of my son Abraham Ouderkirk, before any division of my Estate, the sum of six Pounds, current money of New York, and

<p>Thirdly, I will that the remainder of my Estate be equally divided amongst my six children, that is to say both real and personal Estate, first to my said son Johannes Ouderkirk or his heirs one sixth part thereof, to my son Eldert Ouderkirk a sixth part, to Susannah, the wife of Cornelius Claese, or her heirs an other sixth part, to <a href="../bios/o/isoud6393.html">Isaac</a>, Abraham and Peter Ouderkirk, they or their respective heirs, each a sixth part, so equally to be divided in sixths no one no more than the other.

<p>And Lastly, I do ordain, constitute and appoint all and every of my above named children to be executors of this my Last Will and Testament, in Testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and sealed in the City of Albany the day and year first above written, yet before I have signed and sealed this my Last Will and Testament I do will that the six pounds bequeathed to my grandson as above mentioned, if happens to be his minority, that the sum be paid to <a href="../bios/l/rlivingstonjr.html">Mr. Robert Livingston, Jr.</a> and 
<a href="../bios/c/antcoster5968.html">Anthony Coster</a> they to put it out to earn till such time he marrys or becomes of age, thence with the interest thereof to be paid to said grandson on his order.

<p>Signed, Sealed & Published in presence of Robt. Livingston, Jnr., <a href="../bios/b/sambab7186.html">Samuel Babington</a>, David <a href="../bios/s/schuyler.html">Schuyler</a>
