<p>In the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/vs/gvs3959.html">Goose Van Schaick</a>, of Albany, “sloop master,” being mindful of my mortality, I leave all my apparel to my sons Anthony and Goose Van Schaick.

<p>I leave to my wife <a href="../bios/vs/devschaick4029.html">Deborah</a> all my share of the undivided dwelling house and lot in Albany, and 1/3 of the saw-mill and utensils, and the land adjoining, lying in <a href="../na/niskayuna.html">Conestigoyna</a>; Also 1/3 of my sloop, and my Negro man and woman.

<p>After my wife’s decease I leave all my estate to my three children, <a href="../bios/vs/antvschaick3939.html">Anthony</a>, <a href="../bios/vs/cavschaick4011.html">Catalyntie</a> and <a href="../bios/vs/govs4033.html">Goose</a>. I leave to my eldest son Anthony, £10, for his birthright. I leave to my three children all my share of the farm that my <a href="../bios/vs/antvschaick3934.html">father</a> now lives on; the highest bidder of them, and whoever buys it shall pay to the others 1/3 of the price.

<p>My wife shall cause my children to be well educated and put to trades, and shall give them such reasonable bedding and household goods as she thinks convenient.

<p>I make my wife Deborah and my trusty friend <a href="../bios/h/hhollandjr8490.html">Henry Holland</a>, executors. July 20, 1736. Witnesses, Cornelius Van Dyk, Richard Williams, <a href="../bios/s/pischuyler1736.html">Peter P. Schuyler</a>. Proved, October 4, 1736.</p>
