        a legal action produced the following narrative containing property and 
        demographic information. [Paragraphing and some other adjustments added]: 
      <p><blockquote>THIS was an action of ejectment, tried at the Saratoga circuit in May, 1828, before the Hon. Nathan Williams, one of the circuit judges.

        <p>Anthony Van Schaick, by his last will and testament bearing date 17th August, 1781. Devised all his real estate to his Wife Christina for life, with remainder to his daughter Anna, the wife of John G. Van Schaick, in fee.
		 
<p> On the 28th February, 1784, Christina Van Schaick, John G. Van Schaick 
          and Anna his wife, demised lots Nos. 71 and 99 in the Halfmoon or Var. 
          Schaick’s patent to the defendant for the term of sixty-seven years, 
          reserv ing an annual rent of’ £9. The defendant entered into possession 
          of the premises, and remained in possession at the commencement of this 
          suit in May, 1827. Christina Van Schaick died about seventeen years 
          before the trial, and Anna Van Schaick about eleven years before the 
          trial, leaving her husband John G. Van Schaick living. A few days previous 
          to the commencement of this suit, one of the heirs of Anna Van Schaick 
          demanded of the defendant payment of the rent due upon the lease executed 
          to him. The defendant admitted that he held such lease, but refused 
          to pay any rent stating that he had warranty deeds from Mr. Ludlow and 
          others for the land This suit was then commenced for the recovery of 
          the demised premises The lessors of the plaintiff were John G. Van 
          Schaick and the children of his marriage with Anna Van Schaick. On this 
          evidence the plaintiff rested On the part of the defendant, it was shown 
          that difliculties having arisen as to the boundaries of the Halfmoon 
          patent and the patent of Kayaderosseras, which adjoined it, an agreement 
          was entered into by the [634] proprietors of those patents on 21st November, 
          1792, to apply to the legislature of the state for the appointment of 
          commissioners to determine the boundary lines between those patents, 
          which agreement was signed, amongst others, by Christina Van Schaick, 
          and the petition was presented. On the 31st January, 1793, a similar 
          agreement was entered into between the proprietors of the patents of 
          Halfmoon, Kayaderosseras and Shannondhoi or Clifton Park; this, however, 
          was not signed by Christina Van Schaiok, nor by any other under whom 
          the lessors of the plaintiff claimed. On 11th March, 1793, an act was 
          passed by the legislature appointing commissioners in pursuance of the 
          prayer of the petitioners. On the 25th February, 1794, a, majority of 
          the commissioners made and filed their determination in the premises, 
          establishing the boundary lines as designated on a map of the ayaderosseras 
          patent subscribed by three commissioners of the names of Yates, Glen 
          and Palmer, and by a surveyor of the name of Webb. The defendant then 
          proved that the premises in question laid within the Kayaderosseras 
          patent according to the lines thus established, and produced in evi 
          dence four deeds of distinct portions of the premises 1n question from 
          sundry . . .
