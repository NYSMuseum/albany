<p>In the name of God, Amen, the 11 January, 1698/99. I <a href="../bios/vb/cjvbock6521.html">Claas J. Van Bockhoven</a> of the village of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>,  in the County of Albany. I leave to Arent Andriese Bratt, son of Andres Bratt, deceased, son of my well beloved wife, <a href="../bios/d/cadvos7854.html">Cathalyntie Andriese De Vass</a>, the sum of £5, which he is to have upon his grand mother’s decease, and not before.

<p>I leave to <a href="../bios/vp/cavpatten.html">Cathalyntie Claas</a>, daughter of my wife’s eldest daughter, Affie, wife of Claas Van Pelt (who is lately married with Dirck Teunisses son <a href="../bios/vv/tdvvechten6049.html">Teunis</a>), a gold ring for her finger which she is to have after my wife’s decease. I leave to Maritie, the eldest daughter of Jan Botman (probably Pootman), a gold ring.

<p> I leave all the rest of my estate to my wife Catalyntie Andries De Vass, that is to say my farm, situate, lying and being on the north side of Magnos River, at Canastigione, between the land of Jan Mangelse, and the land of Jan Litree, and my lot of land on the south side of Canastigione River, and on the east side of <a href="../bios/c/macregier5312.html">Marte Cregier’s</a> also my house and lot in Albany, between the house and lot of <a href="../bios/vkl/jvloon2399.html">Jan Van Loon</a>, and all household goods.

<p>And after her death I leave all the aforesaid lands and goods to the six children of my said wife and their children, namely, the children of Andries Bratt, Samuel Bratt, Affie, wife of Claas Van Pelt; <a href="../bios/b/arbradt5454.html">Ariantie</a>, wife of Ryer Schermerhorn, the children of Cornelius Bratt, formerly wife of Jan Pootman.

<p>I appoint my wife executor, and <a href="../bios/s/rjscher5490.html">Ryer Jacobs Schermerhorn</a>, and Dirck Arent Bratt, overseers.
