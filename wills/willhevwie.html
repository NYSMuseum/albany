<font face=arial>

<p>God be praised in the highest. <a href="../bios/vw/hegvwie6571.html">Hendrick van Wie</a>, being quite infirm, but in full possession of his mind, walking and standing, has declared to us his last will and desire as follows:

<p>First, Hendrick van Wie wills that his wife shall remain in full possession of his estate so long as she lives, on condition that she bring up the children to the best of her poor ability, and after her death the lawful heirs begotten of them shall share alike, except that the eldest son shall first of all have a horse. But whenever his wife shall marry again, an inventory should be made of all there is in order that the estate be not diminished. 

<p> In witness hereof he has signed this with his own hand. 


<br>This is  the X mark of Hendrick van Wie
