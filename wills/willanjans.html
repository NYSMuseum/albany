      <p> In the name of the Lord, Amen. Know all men by these presents, That 
        this day, the 29th of January, 1663, in the afternoon, about four o’clock, 
        appeared before me, <a href="../bios/vs/divschelluyne.html">Derrick Van 
        Schelluyne</a>, notary public, in the presence of the witnesses hereafter 
        mentioned, <a href="../bios/j/anjans.html">Anneke Janse</a>, widow of 
        Roeloff Janse, of Master Land, and now lastly widow of Reverend <a href="../bios/b/evbogardus.html">Everardus 
        Bogardus</a>, residing in the village of <a href="../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>, 
        and well known to us, notary and witnesses; the said Anneke Janse lying 
        on her bed in a state of sickness, but perfectly sensible and in the full 
        possession of her mental powers, and capable to testate, to which sound 
        state of mind we can fully testify. The said Anneke Janse considering 
        the shortness of life and certainty of death and the uncertainty of the 
        hour or time, she said Anneke Janse, declared after due consideration 
        without any persuasion, compulsion, or retraction, this present document 
        to be her last will and testament, in manner following: 
      <p>First of all recommending her immortal soul to the Almighty God, her 
        Creator and Redeemer, and consigning her body to Christian burial, and 
        herewith revoking and annulling all prior testamentary dispositions of 
        any kind whatsoever, and now proceeding anew, she declared to nominate 
        and institute as her sole and universal heirs her children, <a href="../bios/j/sajans.html">Sara Roeloffson</a>, 
        wife of Hans Kierstede; Catrina Roeloffsen, wife of Johanes Van Brugh; 
        also Jannnettije and Rachel Hartgers, the children of her deceased daughter, 
        Fytje Roeloffsen, during her life the wife of Peter Hartgers, representing 
        together their mother’s place; also her son Jan Roeloffsen, and finally, 
        William, <a href="../bios/b/cobogardus6362.html">Cornelius</a>, Jonas, 
        and <a href="../bios/b/pibogardus6381.html">Peter Bogardus</a>, and to 
        them to bequeath all her real estate, chattels, money, gold and silver, 
        coined and uncoined, jewels, clothes, linen, woolen, household furniture, 
        and all property what soever, without reserve or restriction of any kind, 
        to be disposed of after her decease and divided by them in equal shares, 
        to do with the same at their own will and pleasure without any hindrance 
        whatsoever; provided never the less with this express condition and restriction 
        that her four first born children shall divide between them out of their 
        father’s property the sum of one thousand guilders, to be paid to them 
        out of the proceeds of a certain farm, situate on Manhattan Island, bounded 
        on the North river, and that before any other dividend takes place; and 
        three of the children at the time of their marriage received certain donations, 
        and as Jan Roeloffsen is yet unmarried, he is to receive a bed and milch 
        cow; and to Jonas and Peter Bogardus she gives a house and lot situated 
        to the westward of the house of the testatrix in the village of Beverwyck, 
        going in length until the end of a bleaching spot, and in breadth up to 
        the room of her, the testatrix, house, beside a bed for both of them and 
        a milch cow to each of them, the above to be an equivalent of what the 
        married children have received. Finally, she, the testatrix, of what the 
        married children have received. 
      <p>Finally, she, the testatrix, gives to Roeloff Kierstede, the child of 
        her daughter Sara, a silver mug; to Annatje Van Brugh, the child of daughter 
        Catrina, also silver mug; and to Jannettje and Rachel Hartgers, the children 
        of her daughter Fytje, a silver mug each; and to the child of William 
        Bogardus named Fytje also a silver mug; all the above donations to be 
        provided for out of the first moneys received and afterwards the remainder 
        of the property to be divided and shared as aforesaid. The testatrix declares 
        this document to be her only true last will and testament, and desiring 
        that after her decease it may supersede all other testaments, codicils, 
        donations, or any other instruments whatsoever; and in case any formalities 
        may have been omitted, it is her will and desire the same benefits may 
        occur as if they actually have been observed; and she requested me, notary 
        public, to make one or more lawful instruments in the usual form of this, 
        her, testatrix, last will and desire. 
      <p>Signed, sealed, and delivered at the house of the testatrix in the village 
        of Beverwyck, in New Nitherland, in the presence of <a href="../bios/vw/rjvwoert2637.html">Ruth

      volume 28, pp. 487-90. 
      <p>[Note from printed text] Anneke Janse, was the wife of Roeloff Janse, 
        who came to New Amsterdam about 1631. In 1636 he obtained a grant from 
        Governor Van Twiller for a farm or Bowers of about 62 acres, which has 
        long been a bone of contention between the heirs of Anneke Janse and Trinity 
        Church in New York. Roeloff Jansen died about 1637, and his widow soon 
        married Rev. Everadus Boguardus, and lived with him at what is now No. 
        23 Whitehall street, New York. Dominie Bogardus was lost at sea, by the 
        wreck of the “Princess,” in which he was returning to Holland. His widow 
        then went to Beverwyck, and died there. She was buried in the yard of 
        the Old Dutch Church in Albany. Her house and lot in Beverwyck were sold 
        by her heirs to Dirck Wessells. “Bounded east by land of Jonas and Peter 
        Bogardus, and west by Evert Janse Wendell. Being 2 rods 81/2 feet wide, 
        and 5 rods 9 feet long The price was 1000 guilders in good whole merchantable 
        beaver skins, at 8 guilders a piece. June 21, 1663. It was on the east 
        corner of State and James streets."
