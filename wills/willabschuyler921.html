<FONT face="arial">

          <p><b>I</b>n the name of God, Amen. Know all men by these presents that 
            I, the undersigned, <a href="../bios/s/abschuyler921.html">Abraham 
            Schuyler</a>, burgher and inhabitant of Albany in the province of 
            New York, hale and sound in body and having full possession of my 
            understanding, memory and speech, considering the frailty of this 
            life, the certainty of death and the uncertain hour thereof wishing 
            therefore to dispose of the temporal effects which God Almighty has 
            granted me, commending first and foremost my soul to the gracious 
            hands of God my Creator and Savior and my body to a Christian burial, 
            dispose as follows: 
          <p>That after my death my respected wife <a href="../bios/t/getbroeck46.html">Geertry 
            Schuyler</a> shall remain in full possession of my whole estate and 
            effects, that is real and personal estate, nothing therefrom excepted, 
            during her widowhood. 

<p>That on the remarriage of my aforesaid wife, before her wedding day, 
            she shall relinquish all my real estate, as well houses and lots as 
            lands, to my five children, to wit, <a href="../bios/s/daaschuyler1265.html">David</a> aged about seventeen years, 
            Christyna aged about fifteen years, Dirck aged about ten years, Abraham 
            aged about five years, together with the child or children which in 
            this resent wedlock we may yet have, to the end that the same may 
            be equally divided among my children, share and share alike, except 
            that my eldest son David shall for his birthright have the sum of 
            five pounds current money of this province, with the understanding 
            and my will is that my house and lot lying here in Albany in the <a href="../streets.html">Brouwers 
            straet</a>, at present by me occupied, shall go to my two sons David 
            and <a href="../bios/s/jaschuyler1327.html">Jacobus</a> aforesaid, share alike, which house and lot they shall 
            receive by appraisal of three impartial persons, in order that the 
            just portion may be turned over to the other child or children when 
            each child attains his or her majority or marries; with the further 
            understanding that if my aforesaid wife marry again, she may never 
            the less remain in occupancy of the little house on the street and 
            have the use of a lot in the rear of the breadth of said house, for 
            the term of seven years beginning from such marriage day and no longer. 
          <p>My wife remains holden on the marriages of each of my children to give a proper according to the value of the estate.

          <p>I nominate and appoint as guardians and executors of my children 
            and whole estate aforesaid my two brothers <a href="../bios/s/dadschuyler1263.html">David</a> 
            and <a href="../bios/s/mynschuyler101.html">Myndert Schuyler</a> with 
            my two brothers-in -law <a href="../bios/t/wtbroeck83.html">Wessel</a> 
            and <a href="../bios/t/satbroeck79.html">Samuel Ten Broeck</a>, to the end that my foregoing will in all its 
            parts may be observed and maintained. All that is here in before written 
            the testator declares to be his last will and testament. Thus with 
            my own hand subscribed and sealed in Albany this fifteenth day of 
            December annoq. domini one thousand seven hundred and nine.</p>
