<p>In the name of God, Amen, I, <a href="../bios/t/cotbroeck31.html">Cornelius Ten Broeck</a>, of Albany, merchant, being in perfect health. I leave to my son <a href="../bios/t/jotbroeck55.html">John</a> £60, for his birthright as my heir at law. I leave to my wife <a href="../bios/c/macuyler596.html">Maria</a> the possession of all my estate, real and personal, during the time she remains my widow, "making no waste or destruction."

<p> After her death or marriage, I leave to my son John my dwelling house, storehouse, and lot of ground in the <a href="../wards.html#3">3rd Ward</a> in Albany, where I now live. I leave to my daughter <a href="../bios/t/catbroeck7.html">Catharine</a>, wife of George Wray, a lot of ground to the east and opposite to the above, bounded west by street, north by the house and lot of <a href="../bios/b/shbogardus6388.html">Schebald Borgardus</a>, south by the house and lot of Abraham Vosburgh, as it was sold to me by <a href="../bios/s/abschuyler921.html">Abraham Schuyler</a>, deceased; 

<p>Also 2 lots with buildings, as purchased of Frederick Osterman, lying in New York, being houses and lots 10 and 11, fronting Hague Street, bounded west by lot of Peter Grims, as by deed. 
<p>If my said daughter and her husband desire to live in Albany, they may build a house on her lot during the life of my wife. I leave to grandson, Cornelius Ten Broeck, Jr., Lot 29, which among others fell to my share in the partition of a certain <a href="../res/realestate.html">Patent</a> lying in the County of Albany, on the south side of the Mohawk river, granted to Matthew Young, <a href="../bios/h/edholland.html">Edward Holland</a>, myself and others, October 11, 1765; Also 200 acres of land which may be first drawn out of my 3000 acres upon the  partition of a Patent which I have in Company with <a href="../bios/b/jorbleecker201.html">John R. Bleecker</a>, <a href="../bios/d/pedouw2164.html">P.Douw</a>, and Lambert Moore.

<p>After the death of my wife I leave to my son John and to my daughter Catharine all the rest of my estate, divided, and if they sell during my wife's life they shall pay 1/3 to her. After my wife's death I leave to my grandson, Cornelius Ten Broeck, Jr., my Negro "Jan" and to my daughter, Jenny, daughter of my daughter Catharine, a Negro girl. I leave to my son John and my daughter Catharine, wife of George Wray, all my plate and household furniture, bedding, cattle and money. 

<p>I make my son John, and my wife Maria, and my daughter Catharine, executors.</p>
