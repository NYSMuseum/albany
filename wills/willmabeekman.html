<p><b>I</b>n the name of God Amen.

<p>Both of our will is that the survivor of us shall remain in full possession of all our estate, real and personal; until it shall please the Lord to take us both to himself. We, leave to our son <a href="../bios/b/jombeekman3863.html">Johannis M. Beekman</a>, £10, for his right of Primogeniture, and as a bar to his pretention of being heir at law to either of us; Also the lot of ground and buildings thereon in the City of Albany, between the house and lot now in the tenure and occupation of <a href="../bios/d/abdouw2052.html">Abraham Douw, Esq.</a>, to our daughter <a href="../bios/b/evbeekman3911.html">Eve</a>, the wife of <a href="../bios/s/abschuyler924.html">Abraham Schuyler</a>, the house and lot with the buildings thereon erected wherein we now live, and as the same in our possession to use, occupy and enjoy during her and her said husband’s lives and at their decease the same to go to her children. To our son <a href="../bios/b/jombeekman3863.html">Johannis M.</a> (before any division of our estate between him and his said sister) £60.

<p>The rest of our estate either in possession or inversion at the time of our decease, or which of right we or either of us are entitled to from the estates of our Fathers, <a href="../bios/b/jombeekman3858.html">Johannis Beekman</a> and <a href="../bios/v/dihvisscher4067.html">Tjerck Harmense Visger</a>, by their respective last wills devised to us or either of us, we give our said two children, Johannis M. Beekman and Eva Schuyler, equally divided. We nominate our said son Johannis M. and son-in-law, Abraham Schuyler, and our daughter, Eva Schuyler, executors.</p>
