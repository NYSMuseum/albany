<p>In the name of God, Amen. I, <a href="../bios/g/stgroesbeck3377.html">Stephanus Groesbeek</a>, of Albany, merchant, August 29, 1743. I leave to my eldest son <a href="../bios/g/jogroesbeck3352.html">John</a>, £15 in full of his right of primogeniture. I leave to my <a href="../bios/l/ellansing3231.html">wife</a> £60 a year, and she is to have the use of all my houses and silver plate and household goods and two negroes. 

<p>I leave to my son John all my farm "at a place called Tinker Hooghten in 
Schenectady," on the north side of the Mohawk river at the value of £600, to 
be paid to my children <a href="../bios/g/cagroesbeck3268.html">Catharine</a>, <a href="../bios/g/elgroesbeck3292.html">Elizabeth</a>, and <a href="../bios/g/gegroesbeck3298.html">Gerardus</a>. I leave to my son  
Gerardus all that my lot of ground in Albany in <a href="../streets.html#pearl">Parel</a> street in the second ward, where I now dwell, between the house and lot of <a href="../bios/vi/wavi2500.html">Warner van Jueren</a>, and the house and lot of Janettie Ten Eyck, and the lot of Abraham Cuyler, with 
the house and tenements; 

<p>Also all my share and right in a certain tract of land or island, lying at or near a place called Otiquage on the south side of the Mohawk river, granted by Patent unto <a href="../bios/b/rjbleecker227.html">Rutger Bleecker</a>, Nicholas Bleecker and others, being my 1/5 part. This and the house and lot at Albany is to be valued at £750, and is to be accounted as part of my estate, so that my other children, John, Catharine, and Elizabeth, shall have each an equal part of my estate. I leave to my daughter Catharine, wife of Peter Schuyler, all that my land lying near <a href="../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a> at Tionondorago in the Mohawk country, now in the occupation of Frans Cruger, for her life, and then to her son Stephen Schuyler, at the value of £450. And Stephen Schuyler shall pay to his 
brothers and sisters each an equal part of the same, reserving one part to 
himself.

<P>I leave to my daughter Elizabeth, wife of Stephen van Rensselaer, my 
two houses and lots in <a href="../streets.html#state">Jonker street</a> in the First ward in Albany, near the <a href="../stpeters.html">English church</a>, during her life and then to her son <a href="../bios/vr/svr5114.html">Stephen</a>, at the value of £160; and he is to pay his brothers and sisters each an equal part. I leave to my children, John, Catharine, Elizabeth, and Gerardus, all that my lot of  
ground in the manor of <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerwyck</a> near Steenbergh, on the west side of 
the highway, to be equally divided; the south part to my son John, the next 
to my daughter Catharine, the next to my daughter Elizabeth, and the north 
part to my son Gerardus. I leave to my children, John, Elizabeth, and 
Gerardus, each 1/4 part of all my lands situate in the County of Albany at a 
place called Maroomskack, near Hoosick. The other 1/4 I leave to the children 
of my daughter Catharine, viz., Peter, Elizabeth, Stephen, and Philip Schuyler. I leave to my son John an Indian boy "Jeff," and a negro wench for his daughter Elizabeth. To my daughters Catharine and Elizabeth each 2 negroes, to my son Gerardus, 3 negroes. The above mentioned sums of money are to be equally divided between my children, also the sums which are charged to them on my book. 

<p>I leave my house and lot in <a href="../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and all the rest of my estate to all my children, and I make my wife Elizabeth and all my children executors.
