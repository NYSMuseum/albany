          <p><b>"I</b>n the name of God, Amen. On the fourth day of February in the first 
            year of the reign of our sovereign King George, of Great Britain, 
            &. and in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred fourteen 
            and fifteen. I, <a href="../bios/t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselez 
            Ten Broeck</a>, late of Albany, now of the manor of Livingston in 
            Dutches county, being sound in body having perfect possession and 
            use of my understanding, memory and faculties, but considering the 
            shortness and frailty of human life, the certainty of death and the 
            uncertainty of the hour thereof, have after careful consideration, 
            of my won motion, without the inducement, persuasion or misleading 
            of anyone, made, ordained and determined this my last will and testament, 
            revoking, canceling and annulling hereby all and every testament heretofore 
            made and executed by me and desiring that this alone be taken as my 
            last will and testament, in form and manner following:</p>

<p>First, I commend my immortal soul when it shall depart from my body to the gracious and merciful hands of God my Creator and Savior and my body to the earth whence it came, in Christian burial, there to remain until my soul shall be reunited to the body upon the joyful day of resurrection, to be made partaker of that insatiable joy of our salvation which God of his grace through the merit of Jesus Christ has prepared and promised for all who have true penitence and faith in him.

<p>First. Respecting such temporal goods as the Lord, above my deserts, has pleased to grant me, I give and dispose of the same in manner following:

<p>Second. I give to my oldest son <a href="../bios/t/wtbroeck83.html">Wessel Ten Broeck</a> for his birth right as my first son the sum of three pounds current money of New York, who I desire shall make no further claim to any part of my estate, save an equal portion with his sisters and brothers as is hereinafter expressed.

<p>Third. Furthermore it s my will and desire that after my death my just debts to any and all persons shall in due time be paid by my heirs.

          <p>Fourth. I appoint my well-beloved wife <a href="../bios/vb/chvburen29.html">Christyna 
            Wesselz Ten Broeck</a> after my death as executrix and administration 
            of my whole estate, as well movable as immovable, lands, houses, lots, 
            obligations, claims, rents, gold and silver coined and uncoined, jewels, 
            clothing both linen and woolen, horses, cattle, Negroes, negroeses 
            and other property, nothing whatsoever expected or reserved from my 
            whole estate, as well here in this country, in England, Holland or 
            elsewhere, wherever they may be situated or be found, to administer 
            thereon without interference or contradiction of my children or anyone 
            else, or without being held to give any inventory or accounting during 
            the time of her widowhood, but on the express condition that she shall 
            not have power to sell, alienate or dispose of my real or immovable 
            estate wherever it may lie, as lands, houses, lots, and rents, but 
            shall only receive the usufruct and yearly income thereof during her 
            widowhood; but if she marry again, she shall be holden before she 
            enter into the marriage state an inventory of my whole estate to deliver 
            to my sons, to wit; <a href="../bios/t/wtbroeck83.html">Wessell Ten Broeck</a>, <a href="../bios/t/satbroeck79.html">Samuel Ten Broeck</a>, <a href="../bios/t/jotbroeck52.html">Johannes Ten Broeck</a> and <a href="../bios/t/totbroeck82.html">Tobias Ten Broeck</a>, whom I appoint as executors of my whole estate, as well movable as immovable, to administer upon the same, which administrators shall be holden to pay my said wife a third 
            of the yearly income during her life; the other two thirds, after 
            all the expenses incurred shall have been deducted, it is my will 
            shall be equally divided yearly among my eleven children or their 
            heirs, namely: Wessel Ten Broeck; <a href="../bios/t/elstbroeck42.html">Elsje Ten Broeck</a>, wife of Johannes

            to each a just eleventh part.
 
          <p>Fifth. After my wife's death, I give and bequeath to my eldest son 
            Wessell Ten Broeck two-thirds of all my lands lying in Sarachtoge, 
            in the county of Albany, and the other third part of said lands I 
            give and bequeath to my daughter Geertruy Schuylers, wife of Abraham 
            Schuylaer, which lands aforenamed are a just seventh part of the whole 
            of Sarachotoge according to patent in company with <a href="../bios/s/pischuyler61.html">Col.

            son and daughter Geertruy, as aforewritten, to wit, two-thirds for 
            the aforenamed Wessel and his heirs forever, provided that such shall 
            serve in payment and satisfaction of the aforenamed Wessel's portion 
            of the inheritance of my estate to the amount of one hundred and twenty-five 
            pounds New York currency, likewise to my daughter Geertury aforenamed 
            to just third part f the land aforesaid in payment of the sum of seventy-five 
            pounds like currency of New York, to be deducted from her inheritance 
            which aforesaid third part I give to her and her heirs for the aforesaid 
            sum forever after my wife's death.</p>

          <p>Sixth. Furthermore, I give to my sons Samuel Ten Broeck and Tobias Ten Broeck 
            all my lands in the aforesaid manor of Livengstoen according to conveyance 
            to me given by Mr. <a href="../bios/l/rlivingston94.html">Robbert 
            Livingstoen</a>, to be divided in two equal parts, whereof my son 
            Tobias shall have the choice of one half and the other half for my 
            said son Samuel, for them and their respective heirs forever, besides 
            which I give to my two sons Samuel and Tobias aforewritten four horses, 
            four cows, four sheep, four hogs, one of my negroes my farm, for which 
            I will that my sons pay to the aforenamed executors each a sum of 
            one hundred and ninety pounds New York money, being together three 
            hundred and eighty pounds, provided that each of the two shall have 
            liberty to deduct from the aforenamed sum in his full portion of the 
            inheritance of my whole estate, that is to say if their inheritance 
            does not amount to so much as this aforenamed sum, than they must 
            pay up and turn over the deficiency to my administrators, but if their 
            inheritance comes to more then they shall be paid out of the estate, 
            but the shall not lay claim to the bequeathed land before my aforesaid 
            wife's death, when they shall receive the lands with house, barn, 
            ricks, farm and all rights therein forever. </p>

<p>Seventh.
