<FONT size=-1><a href="../guide/histres.html#probate">Will</a> dated March 13, 1688. Probated January 6, 1696. Printed in <a href="../sources.html#cw"><i>Calendar of Wills</i></a>, #1294. After a search of known <a href="../guide/histres.html#probate">sources and finding aids</a>, neither the will document nor the letters of administration themselves have been found to date.

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA151&lpg=RA2-PA92&id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false"><i>PFS</i></a> tells us that letters testamentary were issued to Hendrick and Jan on the day of probate. Pearson's summary follows:
<blockquote>Oothout (Oothoet), Jan Janse, of Greenbush, brewer, in Albany as early as 1665; made his will March 13,1687-8; letters of administration to his sons Hendrik and Jan. Jan. 3, 1695-6, gave to son Johannes a red mare; to Hendrick, 3 or 4 years after " my decease" a young horse or an old one; Arien, aged about 12 y. to have two years schooling and a trade, and a red stone horse with a Star in his forehead; when 20 years of age a new suit of clothes, and then the remaining property was to be divided equally among his 6 children. His ch. were Johannes, eldest son; Hendrick; Arien; Mayke w. of Capt. Johannes Thomase Mingael; Antje; and Jannetle.</blockquote></font size><p></p>
