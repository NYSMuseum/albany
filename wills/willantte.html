<p>In the name of God, Amen. I <a href="../bios/t/antte4842.html">Anthony Ten Eyck</a> of the Manor of <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, in Albany County, being weak in body.

<p>I leave to my son Coenraedt, one-half of a certain lot in <a href="../na/coeypat.html">Coeyman's Patent</a>, known by the name of the Cruple Bush, which contains 140 acres. And also so much of the land laid out by <a href="../bios/b/jorbleecker201.html">John R. Bleecker</a> into two lots sometime in September, 1767, and adjoining to said Cruple Bush, as with the said half lot will make 200 acres. I also leave him "my watch, buttons and apparell, arms, sword, ammunition, buckles and my Large Dutch <a href="../guide/histres.html#bible">Bible</a>."

<p>Whereas I received &pound700 from my <a href="#wife">wife</a> at our marriage, for which I gave a bond to Theodorus Van Wyck and Dirck Brinkerhoff of New York, of which I have paid &pound200, my executors are to pay the rest. And whereas I also gave them a bond to pay to my wife &pound60 yearly for life, in lieu of dower, my executors shall pay the same.

<p>I leave to my daughters, Catharine and Susan, a "small lot on the north side of Coeyman's Creek, near the bridge"; Also a lot called the Bogertie (<i>Little Orchard</i>), and a lot called the Plantations.

<P>My executors are to sell enough to pay all debts.

<P>My two daughters are to be maintained until my daughter Susan is 21, and the children of my late daughter Sarah are to be maintained until of age.

<p>I leave all the rest to my son Coenrad, and to my daughters Gertie, Catharine, and Susan, and to the children of my daughter Sarah, deceased. What I have advanced to my children is to go towards their shares.

<P>I make my son Conrad and my daughters, Catharine and Susan, executors.

<P>Dated April 24, 1775. Witnesses James Waldron, blacksmith, Wilhelmus Douw, David McCarty, merchant. 

<p>Proved, June 20, 1775.
