          <p><b>I</b>n the name of God, Amen. By the contents of this present 
            public instrument know all men that in the year after the birth of 
            our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, one thousand six hundred and eighty-four, 
            on the 6th of July, about midday, and in the thirty-sixth year of 
            his majesty's reign Charles the second, before me, <a href="../bios/l/rlivingston94.html">Robert 
            Livingston</a>, secretary of Albany, colony of <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Renselaerswyk 
            </a>and Shinnechtady, etc., and before the hereinafter named witnesses, 
            came and appeared the Honorable <a href="../bios/w/piwinne8568.html">Pieter 
            Winne</a>, magistrate, born in the city of Gent in d Landeren, at 
            present sick in body but of sound memory and understanding as is clearly 
            apparent, who, considering the shortness and frailty of human life, 
            the certainty of death and the uncertainty of the time and hour thereof, 
            therefore wishing to dispose of his temporal effects to be left behind 
            while he yet by God's grace is able, and doing so of his own free 
            will and motion, without the inducement or misleading of anyone, he 
            now ordains and determines that his last <a href="#will">will</a> 
            and testament in form and manner following:</p>

            <p>First and foremost commending his immortal soul (whenever it shall 
              be separated from his body) to the gracious and merciful hands of 
              his Creator and Savior and his body to a Christian burial, likewise 
              canceling and revoking and annulling thereby all and every such 
              testamentary disposition and bequest as he before the date hereof 
              may have made and executed, especially that will by himself and 
              wife made under date of the first of June 1677, written by Mr. <a href="../bios/vi/ajvilp.html">Adriaen 
              van Ilpendam</a>, notary public, holding the same null and of no 
              effect and now making a new disposition, this testator declares 
              that he has nominated and instituted, as he does nominate and institute 
              hereby, his worthy and beloved wife <a  href="../bios/a/adamswinne.html">Tannetje 
              Adams</a> as his sole and universal heir of all his lands, property 
              real and personal, claims, credits, money, gold, silver coined and 
              enchained, jewels, clothing, linen, woolens, household furniture, 
              etc., nothing excepted, so long as she remains in her widowed state, 
              without her being called upon or annoyed by any one of the children, 
              or anyone for them, for an inventory or anything appertaining to 
              the estate and after her death shall his estate be equally divided 
              among the children whom they have begotten together, share and share 
              alike. But if his wife enters the marriage state again, then she 
              shall be golden to divide and apportion the whole estate;</p>

            <p>that is to say, a just half thereof as it then may be found to 
              the beehive of the children whom he has begotten by his present 
              wife forenamed, namely Adam Winne, <a href="../bios/w/liwinne2995.html">Divines</a>, 
              <a href="../bios/w/frwinne2113.html">Frans</a>, Aleppo, wife of 
              Casper Leendertse Tenyn, Killiaen, <a href="../bios/w/thwinne3128.html">Tomas</a>, 
              Lyntje, Marte, <a href="../bios/w/jawinne2935.html">Jacobus</a>, 
              Eva, <a href="../bios/w/dawinne.html">Daniel</a>, and <a href="../bios/w/rawinne3768.html">Rachel 
              Winne</a>; and the other half to the behoof of his wife, and this 
              reservation that she remain holden to the minor children to bring 
              up in the fear of the Lord, and cause them to learn reading and 
              writing and a trade or handicraft wherewith in due time they may, 
              by God's favor, and with honor obtain their subsistance, the legitimate 
              portion of said minor children remaining so long in the hands of 
              their mother aforesaid and the rents and profits thereof being by 
              her received until they arrive at maturity and enter into matrimony, 
              she giving good security that the portions of the minor children 
              be not lessened; and to the other children who may be already married 
              and have arrived at their majority to pay over their portion pro 
              rata, as their shares in the estate may be, share and share alike, 
              no more to the eldest than to the youngest; she being holden to 
              deliver an inventory of the whole estate and confirm the same, if 
              necessary, by oath. The testator wills and ordains hereby that after 
              his death his oldest son Pieter Pieterse Winne, dwelling in the 
              Sopus, shall out of the common estate receive once for all the sum 
              of ten beavers in place of his legitimate portion and entire inheritance, 
              wherewith he shall be content, without any more, not willing that 
              he or anyone for him shall make the least claim any more upon the 
              testator's estate, directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>The testator further desires that if it please God the Lord both he and his wife to remove, both being now sick, the whole estate shall be kept together, without any division or partition, until the youngest child shall attain her majority or enter the marriage state, and then be divided among the aforesaid twelve children, share and share alike, the portion of that child or children who die in their nonage to go to the survivors.</p>

          <p>The testator excludes herein the honored orphan masters (saving all honor and 
            respect) and in their place requests and constitutes, as he hereby 
            does <a href="../bios/vb/mgvb6656.html">Mr. Marte Gerritse</a> and <a href="../bios/vd/cvdyck821.html">Mr. Cornelis van Dyck</a> (who have accepted 
            the same) to see the contents of this his last will and testament 
            promptly and uprightly carried out in all its parts and provisions. 
            All which he, the testator, declares to be his last will and testament, 
            desiring the same after his death to have full force and effect whether 
            as will, codicil, donation, gift in anticipation of death, or otherwise, 
            as the same may be last maintained, notwithstanding that some formalities 
            demanded by law or custom may not have been fully observed herein; 
            desiring the utmost benefit hereof to be received, and one or more 
            copies hereof to be made and executed as occassion may require. This 
            done and executed at <a href="../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>, 
            lying in the county of Albany on Hudson's river, two miles to the 
            south of the city of Albany, at the house of the testator, which [will] 
            he has signed and sealed in the presence of Mr. Marte Gerritse and 
            Mr. Cornelis van Dyck, magistrates called as witnesses hereto, the 
            year, month and day aforenamed.</p>
