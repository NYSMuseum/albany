<p><font size=+1><b>O</b>n a typical day in the eighteenth century, a <a href="loc/court.html">large 
  number of people</a> were visible on Albany <a href="streets.html">streets</a>. 
  City people came face-to-face on main thoroughfares and in back alleys, around 
  the fort, along the waterfront, and in downtown shops, stores, and markets on 
  a daily basis. Until the 1760s, colonial Albany was a compact community of about 
  <a href="im/im1770.html">twenty city blocks</a> where its <a href="newcomers.html">diverse</a> 
  men, women, and <a href="children.html">children</a> were evolving an urban 
  culture based on mutual reliance and cooperation.</p>

<p><a href="#image"><img SRC="images/jpg/wmbwinne.jpg" ALT="the three-penny postman" HSPACE=8 VSPACE=4 BORDER=1 width=88 align=left></a>As   he carried the mail from the post office on Market Street to recipients in all 
  parts of the city, <a href="bios/w/wbwinne.html">William B. Winne</a> was among 
  the more visible members of the everyday community. He was well known in the 
  city because, like many of his neighbors, Willie Winne held a number of other 
  part-time jobs that together helped him make ends meet. This nostalgic characterization 
  of him symbolizes the large and growing part of the early Albany workforce that 
  provided the varied services that made Albany a <a href="earlycity.html">pre-industrial 
  city</a> and gave city life a <a href="cityfathers.html">rhythm quite different</a> 
  from that of the surrounding countryside.</p>

<p><a name=cartman>By the mid-1700s, city people no longer were self-sufficient. 
  Most of them had come to rely on their neighbors for many necessities and for 
  a range of services that were performed individually by those living beyond 
  sight of the city stockade. As Albany's working people became increasingly specialized 
  in their primary enterprises, they turned to their neighbors for staples and 
  perishable products and to the <a href="loc/cityhall.html">city government</a> 
  for basic support services.  
  These services including transportation and storage, food procurement and preparation, 
  and mutual benefits ranging from midwifery to <a href="dead.html">grave digging</a> 
  represented a vital element of the city's workforce and one that reached more 
  and more deeply into every early Albany household.</p>

<p><a href="#cartman"><img SRC="images/jpg/cartman.jpg" ALT="cartman on upper State Street" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4 BORDER=1 width=230 align=LEFT></a>Postman, custodian, contractor, manager, and inspector, Willie Winne's long work life was like that of many of his Albany neighbors in the years following the American Revolution. He held a variety of jobs, worked for wages for virtually his entire life, and was a very visible but not particularly successful member of the Albany community. While those in the service economy were once at the entry level of the city's workforce - sometimes realizing the goal of transitioning into <a href="makers.html">production</a> or commercial enterprises, by the nineteenth-century those who worked for wages or fees would represent the largest, least affluent, and most static element in an American community that was attracting <a href="population.html">large numbers</a> of new people.</p>

<p>Numerous <a href="art/oldmrbanyar.html">people</a> recorded their impressions of early Albany street life. This page <a href="inprog.html">will provide</a> access to those often colorful stories.</p>
