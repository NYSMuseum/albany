        <b>A</b>mong the most often-asked questions about early Albany relate 
        to the <b>community economy</b>, its business, or how this <a href="../earlycity.html">early 
        American city</a> actually worked! This basic yet complex part of the 
        early Albany story is at the heart of the <a href="../art/art-bbpast.html">inquiry</a> 
        of the <a href="../whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a>. 
        We think about the community economy virtually every day! This page begins 
        to address the concept and provides basic access to what we have found 
        and <a href="#think">think</a> we understand. It is very much <a href="../inprog.html">in-progress</a>!</font size></p></blockquote>
    <br>  

<p><b>G</b>enerally, the community economy is a term of convenience describing how the associated people of a particular place <a href="#provided">provided</a> for themselves, produced and marketed products to gain access to external goods and services, and made their community an attractive destination for new customers and <a href="../newcomers.html">new</a> community members.</p>

<p><a name=cec></a>Again for convenience, we can divide the community economy into three basic elements. These are defined as commerce, production, and service. Without much difficulty, most economic activities can be grouped under these three headings.</p>

<a name=mer></a>
<p><b>The Commercial Economy:</b> At the top of the pyramid are the community's buyers and sellers. <a href="../bios/w/evwendell2657.html"><img src="../images/jpg/th/evwendellth.jpg" border=1 hspace=2 vspace=2 align=right height=100 alt="Merchant Evert Wendell"></a>These business people were called merchants, traders, vendors, and contractors.   In control of Albany's <a href="../corporation.html">municipal government</a>,  they were able to structure the flow of goods and services in and out of the community. In the process, they employed members of the production and service economies. In early Albany, these descendants of the <a href="../furtrade.html">fur traders</a> invested profits in land and sold country products and imported items to the settlers of an expanding <a href="../albanycounty.html">countryside</a>. Sometimes they owned         mills, processing facilities, storehouses, and ships. Some of these businessmen had direct connections to overseas markets and resources. Those who offered manufactured and finely crafted goods from Europe and more exotic spices, foods, and fabrics were often called import merchants. But most Albany merchants were more closely tied to the business community in New York City. It was in their interest to take charge of community development. They were early Albany's <a href="../cityfathers.html">city fathers</a>. These elite citizens ranked in the top quarter of the community's wealth with the real power brokers in the top 5%. Merchants included native sons as well as talented and ambitious <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomers</a>.

<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; At the same time, those identified 
        with trade and business accounted for a sizable percentage of the city's 
        occupational array. In <a href="../census1756.html">1756</a>, the British 
        army labeled 48 out of 329 Albany principals as a "merchant" (ten more 
        were called "Indian traders") - thus accounting for almost fifteen percent 
        of the heads of households. During the 1760s, groups of Albany merchants 
        sent petitions to the royal government. Such <a href="../lists/list1764.html#names">lists</a> 
        provide a baseline for comprehending the size of the Albany business community. 

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because their business involved 
        the selling and buying of goods, products, and produce, shop and store 
        keepers and also <a href="#grocer">grocers</a> are included but on the 
        bottom of the commercial or business economy.

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="../res/sp.html">Victualer</a> is a term occasionally encountered in the community-based record. At this point, its Albany <a href="../res/context.html">context</a> has not yielded specifics regarding its precise definition. The <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=victualler&*">term</a> has been used to identify sellers and suppliers of various items ranging from alcohol products to military and naval supplies. It may describe high-end merchants to common peddlers. See <a href="../bios/c/jacassidy7568.html">James Cassidy</a>

        Production Economy:</b> These were the community's <a href="../makers.html">makers 
        and fixers</a>. For most of the eighteenth century, the artisans and tradesmen 
        constituted the largest part of the community economy. They varied widely 
        in terms of their wealth. Many owned their own homes, shops, and storage 
        facilities. Others rented a room in someone's house. For many, their goal 
        was to move up to the commercial class! Although numerous, their numbers 
        were eroded by the importation of manufactured goods from the European 
        Industrial Revolution. <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Food production (including <a href="../trades/brewer.html">brewing</a> and baking) can be considered a distinct part of the production economy.


        
      <p><a name=sec></a> <b>The Service Economy:</b> Includes all <a href="trans.html">transporters</a>, 
        those providing food and lodging, storage and docking facilities, professional 
        (legal and medical) and human services. Those who derived their livelihood 
        from service to/of government, the courts, or religion also can be considered 
        in this sector. 
      <p><a href="famec.html"><img src="../images/jpg/th/famecth.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=2 alt="Family Economy"></a><a href="famec.html">Family 
        or Domestic Economy</a>: Refers to those goods and services produced within 
        a household to subsist and empower household members. This work usually 
        involved spouses and dependents and took place within the <a href="../homes.html">home</a>.

      <p><a name=grocer></a><b>Grocers</b> sold fresh food products. By the end 
        of the eighteenth century, they were licensed by the Albany <a href="../corporation.html">Council</a> 
        and some lists of licensees appear in the <a href="../guide/histres.html#cr">city 
        records</a>. The first <a href="../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> 
        in 1813, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPP1,M1">listed</a> 
        grocers on virtually every page - a total of at least 120 individuals 
        with addresses spread around the city but mostly beyond the central core. 
        Unlike the 27 shopkeepers whose shops (some services but more often preparation 
        and repair places) and the 91 storekeepers (sales) were separate from 
        their residences, most grocers were not listed with multiple addresses.
