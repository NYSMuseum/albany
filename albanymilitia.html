<br>
<FONT face="arial">
<p><b>T</b>he colonial militia was drawn from the general male population and was organized into companies known by the name of their commanders. By law, all male inhabitants from 15 to 55 were to be enrolled in militia companies. By the 1700s, the New York militia was organized by <a href="albanycounty.html">county</a> and officers were appointed by the royal government.</p>

<p>Militia units composed of ""citizen soldiers" and were distinct from the externally recruited "Independent Companies" companies that <a href="garrison.html">garrisoned</a> the Albany fort. This page <a href="inprog.html">begins to provide access</a> to the Albany <a href="criteria.html">city</a> militia story!

<p>Two relatively complete sets of Albany County militia rosters survive. They cover the years 1714-15 and <a href="#1767">1767</a>. Rosters of <a href="lists/list1715jmc.html">two</a> Albany <a href="lists/list1715grc.html">comp</a>anies and of an Albany <a href="lists/list1715troop.html">troop</a> for 1715 are now online. These lists have been printed in <a href="sources.html#sh">annual reports of the State Historian</a>. Additional information about militia officers and men exists but is much more widely scattered.

  <p><a name=links></a>By the time of the <a href="or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>, 
        the Albany County <a href="http://www.nyhistory.net/~drums/militia_albany.htm">Militia</a> 
        had been reorganized into seventeen regiments reflecting the enormous 
        <a href="albanycounty.html#pop">population</a> growth in the county. The 
        <a href="#1">first regiment</a> was raised from the city of Albany. The 
        <a href="http://www.secondalbany.org/2nd_albany_history_page.html">second 
        regiment</a> was drawn from <a href="na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 
        The third regiment represented <a href="na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> 
        and <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. The <a href="http://www.threerivershms.com/nymilitiaalbany4.htm">Fourth 
        regiment</a> also was drawn from the Manor. The <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nysarato/Sylvester/chap20.html">Eleventh 
        Regiment</a> represented Saratoga. The <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nysarato/Sylvester/chap20.html">Twelfth 
        Regiment</a> was drawn from <a href="na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a> and 
        Ballston.</p>

<p><a href="or/or-fw.html">After the war</a>, "bounty rights" were awarded to the members of each of those regiments - presumably for service to the cause. The <a href="lists/listbr1racm.html">First Regiment list</a> contained 385 names - all of whom were Albany city residents.</p>
