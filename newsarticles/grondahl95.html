<p><b><font size=+3>JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD IT TOO TOUGH</font></b>
<p>PAUL GRONDAHL Staff writer
<blockquote><font size=+1>Want to get a feel for Thanksgiving in colonial
Albany, circa 1700?</font>
<p><font size=+1>OK, first turn off all the lights at night. The house
goes black. Buy a 20-watt bulb and screw it into a socket. Huddle around
its weak glow. That's about all the illumination you'd have from 17th-century
candlelight.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Now, shuffle down to your unfinished basement (go ahead,
feel your way along the walls so you don't fall in the dark).&nbsp; It
should be drafty and cold and a little musty. Essence of wet sweat socks.&nbsp;
Ah, that's about right.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Hungry?&nbsp; You're probably starving.&nbsp; The larder
is becoming bare. Fresh vegetables are a distant memory.&nbsp; By Nov.
23, even fall crops like potatoes and squash are running low and you've
already had to begin food rationing to make it through the winter. If you're
lucky, your Thanksgiving repast might include a slab of dried, salted venison
to gnaw on and a few crusts of stale wheat bread.</font>
<p><font size=+1>You may be running a fever, too. The season of sickness
has arrived. If you're a woman in Albany of childbearing years, it's likely
you're pregnant and struggling with nausea and morning sickness.&nbsp;
A woman in this era delivered at home, with the help of a midwife, an average
of 10 children.&nbsp; That's only counting the full-term pregnancies and
babies who survived into childhood.</font>
<p><font size=+1>There were many miscarriages, stillbirths and deaths in
infancy. The babies were born underweight at birth, they caught pneumonia
and died after a few days.&nbsp; Literally catching your death of cold
was a common fate.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Ready to celebrate Thanksgiving yet?</font>
<p><font size=+1>``Based on my research, Thanksgiving was a non-event in
colonial Albany.&nbsp; I haven't found any record that they celebrated
it here,'' says Stefan Bielinski, director of the <i>Colonial Albany Social
History Project </i>at the New York State Museum and a widely published
scholar of the period.&nbsp; ``Late November was the start of the bleakest
time of year. Winter was coming, and that meant death, starvation, disease
and scarcity.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>Smallpox, yellow fever and assorted plagues lay in wait
for weakened Albanians.&nbsp; The grim reaper cut many out of the pack.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The bottom had fallen out of the lucrative Dutch beaver
trade with the Indians in old Beverwyck in the 1660s, when the trading
post in the downtown core was re-christened Albany.&nbsp; By the 1690s,
the Dutch influence had waned and British colonizers filled the vacuum,
asking the old Albany river rats to turn new cultural tricks.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Life was cramped and leisure time was minimal. The city
was home to about 1,000 souls concentrated in a quarter-mile-square cluster
hugging the Hudson River. As the 17th century merged into the 18th, small
shops popped up on the ground floor of people's homes. Work and hearth
became one. Trade shifted from beavers with the Indians to wheat and lumber
for westward-moving settlers.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The typical house at this time was two stories and measured
about 20 feet across and 30 feet deep, wood-frame construction, brick if
you had some money.&nbsp; Figure 10 children, two adults, maybe a relative
or two and a bakery or butcher's shop stuffed into an area equivalent to
a living room in today's sprawling custom homes.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Each tiny room had a fireplace, continuously stoked with
firewood when you could afford it or cut your own on the outskirts of town
against the cold, damp and drafty abodes.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Come the time of Thanksgiving, days were short.</font>
<p><font size=+1>``It was the age of darkness and their lives were ruled
by light,'' Bielinski says.&nbsp; ``They'd eat their biggest meal in afternoon
daylight and when it got dark at five o'clock, things pretty much shut
down.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>A small consolation: Beer was cheap and brewed aplenty
at several taverns in town.&nbsp; You could always drown your sorrows in
a foamy draft ale.</font></blockquote>
