<p><b><font size=+3>Seeking Ordinary Lives of Yore</font></b>
<p><font size=+2>Albany -- Historian focuses on the sounds and smells of
Colonial Albany</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>BRUCE A. SCRUTON
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Staff writer
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although he has made a 20-year-plus
career of studying and</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; researching Albany's early population,
and has come to know most</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of them on a first-name basis,
Steve Bielinski doesn't know them</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as he'd like.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wouldn't want to live back
then,'' he said recently.&nbsp; "But to</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go back for a day.&nbsp; The
smells.&nbsp; The sounds.&nbsp; To hear an</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18th-century Albanian talk.&nbsp;
The character of courtship.&nbsp; How does</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a garrison soldier sweet-talk
a local girl?''</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bielinski's expertise puts him
in the public eye several times</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; each year with a slide show
featuring the faces and places of</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Colonial Albany, set to the
music he writes and performs.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But don't expect much about the
"rich and famous,'' as Bielinski</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calls those whose names appear
in history books and on old Albany</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mansions.&nbsp; That class of
people has been studied the most, because</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were the ones who left
"stuff,'' like letters, clothes,</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; homes and furnishings.&nbsp;
Because they were rich, and later famous,</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they could afford to get new
stuff.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the middle and lower classes,
however, it was "re-sew, recut,</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reuse until it's all used up,''
said Bielinski, leaving little</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tangible stuff for modern historians
to view.&nbsp; Even the act of</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; writing their name on a document
maybe only happened once or</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; twice in a lifetime.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So for the first 10 years of
his career, Bielinski, 52, spent his</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time studying the rich and famous.&nbsp;
In 1975, he published a book</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Abraham Yates Jr. -- born
into the lower class but, through</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work and taking on causes, he
climbed the social ladder to become</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a famous Albany resident in
the late 18th century.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of years after his book,
Bielinski was giving a lecture</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Yates and his interaction
with the common man of the time when</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; someone asked him "But who were
those people?''</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't know, and it dawned
on me, neither did anyone else. So</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I set out to find out,'' he
said.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While little was known about
the middle and lower classes, there</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were some names.&nbsp; One was
a 1766 document, "The Constitution of</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Albany Sons of Liberty,''
with 94 signatures. Another source</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; was the official census of New
York Colony, taken in 1697.&nbsp; That</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; census included the 174 names
of heads of families in Albany, and</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; further broke down the family
names into numbers of men, women</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and children. Ironically, not
included in the list, that he can</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; account for, were the mayor
at the time and the sheriff who took</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the census.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor was there a precise count
of slaves, who made up about 10</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percent of the population.&nbsp;
By going into marriage, birth and</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other records, Bielinski and
his associates accounted for 714</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people living in Albany that
year.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last 20 years Bielinski
says he has compiled biographies</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for thousands of people, tracing
their roots from the 1697 census</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through the first U.S. census
in 1790, which listed 3,300</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; residents of Albany.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With his memory and names in
hand, Bielinski set out to find the</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; community's economy and how
the three social layers -- rich and</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; famous, makers and fixers, and
unskilled laborers interacted.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Today we earn our living in
a quarter to a third of the day.</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These (Colonial) people worked
all the time.&nbsp; It took much energy</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to survive,'' he said.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What has evolved is the <i>Colonial
Albany Project</i>, a look at the</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; city from the bottom up and
inside out -- who stayed and who came</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; later, the people who made the
basic necessities of life and the</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; merchants who sold them.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bielinski still is doing research
and is trying to fill in blanks</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the history of some families,
such as the Schuylers -- not the</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rich and famous Schuylers who
lived on the hill, but the family</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of Samuel Schuyler, a black
ship captain who bought property</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; along South Pearl Street.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old city directories, property
transactions and even mentions in</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; letters often cross-reference
to other information to give a</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; historian an insight to another
aspect of life.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, for Bielinski, the academics
can fill in only so much. It's</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the day-to-day things like smells,
and sounds and the human</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition that interest him.&nbsp;
"Something simple,'' he said, "Like,</font>
<br><font size=+1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just how did they cope with
the mosquitoes and black flies?''</font>
