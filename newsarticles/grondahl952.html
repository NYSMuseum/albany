<p><b><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+3>EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY</font></font></b>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Paul Grondahl</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The step-gabled Dutch colonial
brick house at the northeast corner of Pearl and State streets (home to
the Fleet Bank building today) stands in the shadow of Albany's fabled
elm tree and is immortalized in an 1840 painting by James Eights in the
collection of the Albany Institute of History &amp; Art.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The house and its owner provides
a history lesson in colonial Albany.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>John Lydius, a Dutch Reformed minister,
arrived in Albany by ship from the Netherlands about 1700 and shortly thereafter
built a brick house on the corner of State and Pearl.&nbsp; He enjoyed
its comfort a brief time before his death in 1710.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>His son, John Henry Lydius, had
no desire to follow his father in a life of the cloth, but approached the
fur trade with a religious zeal. Lydius made his way to Canada, established
a trading network with the Indians and built a prominent trading company
at Fort Edward in the 1740s. Credited as the founder of Fort Edward, Lydius
lived there but kept the family home in Albany.&nbsp; Lydius married Genevive
Masse, who had at least six children and as many as 10 (records are unclear).</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Lydius was mostly in Fort Edward,
while his wife and children lived at State and Pearl in a typical house
of the period two stories, six tiny rooms, 20-feet by 30-feet with a loft
above the top floor for storage.&nbsp; In the 1740s, Lydius the trader
fled Fort Edward, after being burned out by marauding French troops, and
settled in Albany with his family.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>At the mid-way mark of the 18th-century,
when he was in his 50s, Lydius finagled huge land grants from the British
crown encompassing tens of thousands of acres on the Vermont side along
Lake Champlain. Lydius started sub-dividing the vast tracts and struck
it rich.&nbsp; In 1760, Lydius was elected alderman of Albany, making him
one of the six leaders in the city.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>But disgruntled buyers, who felt
swindled when their ownership was challenged, discovered that Lydius was
trafficking in fraudulent land grants.&nbsp; Things went sour for Lydius,
who fled Albanians out for his scalp and Indians who no longer trusted
him after being cheated om trades. In the early 1760s, Lydius sailed for
England, hoping to clear up the land titles with the king and expecting
the flap back in Albany to die down.&nbsp; Citizens and the courts decide
to prosecute Lydius upon his return. Lydius lays low overseas.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The Revolutionary War broke out.
Genevive and the kids weathered the storm in their house at State and Pearl.
One son, Martin, was an Indian interpreter and still living at home with
his mother at the age of 40. Another son, Balthus, a bachelor, didn't seem
to have a steady job. In 1779, the Lydius house was assessed at $400 and
Genevive had to come up with $20 in annual taxes.&nbsp; Martin's personal
income was assessed at $100 and he paid $2.10 in income tax.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>John Henry Lydius died in England
in 1790, a loathed and notorious trader left in disgrace.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>In 1800, Balthus Lydius was still
living in the house at State and Pearl, a bachelor, with two black slaves
and an Indian woman caretaker. By 1810, he had taken in three boarders.
He died in 1815 and his obituary called Balthus ``a very ecccentric character''
and ``the terror of young boys.''</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Stefan Bielinski arches his eyebrows.
He says he doesn't know how to interpret that last point.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The director of the <i>Colonial
Albany Social History Project</i> at the New York State Museum has traced
the story of the Lydius family through their house for a new book he's
writing, ``The Other Revolutionaries.''&nbsp; The Lydius saga will be contained
in a chapter titled, ``Broken Homes: Widows, Abandoned Wives, and Single
Women in Wartime Albany, 1775-83.''</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The Lydius house was sold after
Balthus, the last Lydius male, died in 1815, leaving no descendants. It
was the end of the Lydius direct lineage.&nbsp; The house burned in 1840.&nbsp;
The family's legacy lives on in a small way.&nbsp; A winding road through
the Guilderland portion of the Pine Bush is named Lydius Street.&nbsp;
Madison Avenue used to be Lydius Street, but was re-named.</font></font></blockquote>
