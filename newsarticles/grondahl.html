<p><b><font size=+3>ALBANY'S INVISIBLE COLONIAL BLACKS COME TO LIFE IN
NEW RESEARCH</font></b>
<p>PAUL GRONDAHL Staff writer
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><font size=+1>Stefan Bielinski has forged a career as a historian
by resurrecting lost lives of the ordinary and the invisible in colonial
Albany.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It has been a painstaking task of stitching together scraps
of biographical information from census reports, vital statistics and church
records preserved from more than 200 years ago.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Now, Bielinski has done himself one better.&nbsp; He is
giving form and voice to the most invisible of the invisible: African-Americans
in early Albany.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The key that unlocked this scholarship was Fry's Albany
Directory, a 64-page alphabetical list of the principal residents of the
city published in 1815.&nbsp; There were 2,394 individuals listed, 40 of
whom were printed in a different typeface.&nbsp; A notation on the last
line of the preface stated: "Those persons whose names are in Italics are
free people of color."</font>
<p><font size=+1>From the anonymously marginalized, Bielinski could now
go to work reconstructing the life and times of these italicized members
of Albany, the city's first ``black community.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>Bielinski, founder and director of the <i>Colonial Albany
Social History Project</i> at the State Museum, spoke of the first African-American
families of early Albany as if he knew them.&nbsp; He made it seem as if
he could see them working small boats along the Hudson River in the city's
South End or pushing heavy carts up the steep incline of Arbor Hill.</font>
<p><font size=+1>``These people walked an invisible path through the past,
and it was a compelling challenge researching the stories of their lives,''
Bielinski said.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Invisible path</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Although he estimates blacks accounted for between 10
and 20 percent of the city's population in this era, their collective history
has never been brought into focus.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In the first federal census in 1790, there were 26 free
persons of color living in seven separate city households, and 572 slaves
among the city's 3,498 residents.&nbsp; That 1790 census marked the peak
of slave ownership in Albany, with about one-third of the city's homes
holding slaves.</font>
<p><font size=+1>By 1820, the last census that recorded slaves, Albany
had 645 free people of color and 108 slaves in an overall city population
of almost 13,000.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Bielinski said his findings confirmed that there were
two important, historically rooted black communities in Albany, one in
the South End and the other in Arbor Hill.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Bielinski's scholarship clears up misconceptions that
those inner-city neighborhoods, home today to large concentrations of blacks
and minorities, somehow sprung up from 1960s urban renewal and attendant
ghettoization.&nbsp; To the contrary, those neighborhoods were prosperous
black enclaves since the late 1700s.</font>
<p><font size=+1>``There is a long and proud heritage for the black community
in those neighborhoods,'' Bielinski said.&nbsp; ``These are free people
of color who had an independent life at least by the early 1800s and probably
earlier.''</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Success story</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>One of the most interesting discoveries by Bielinski was
that of Captain Samuel Schuyler (1781-1842), who lived at 204 S. Pearl
St. and worked as a boatman along the river.&nbsp; Schuyler was probably
born a free man, perhaps in New York City or New Jersey, Bielinski surmises,
although records are murky.</font>
<p><font size=+1>What is certain is that Schuyler was an early African-American
success story in Albany.&nbsp; He worked his way up in the boatman trade,
initially leasing dock space on the riverside Quay Street and carrying
cargo between ports and landings on a contract basis hence his appellation
as Captain.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Beginning in 1810, Schuyler acquired an entire block -
at least 15 city lots on South Pearl Street between Bassett and Schuyler
streets on the site of today's Rite Aid Pharmacy.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Schuyler used his block as a coal yard and warehouse,
where his sons developed the Schuyler Tow Boat Line operation.&nbsp; After
Schuyler's death at age 61 in 1842, his widow had a comfortable life and
their four sons received an inheritance that helped them become prosperous
businessmen into the late-19th century.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Bielinski published his findings in last fall's issue
of <u>New York History</u>, a scholarly quarterly published by The New
York State Historical Association in Cooperstown.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Unknowns challenge</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Bielinski said he continues to be frustrated, however,
by the many unknowns posed by his article, ``The Jacksons, Lattimores,
and Schuylers: First African-American Families of Early Albany.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>``I want to go deeper, to know more about these black
families of early Albany,'' he said.&nbsp; ``But they walk such a narrow
path through the past that it's difficult to tell their story.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>One big question mark in Bielinski's mind is the connection,
if any, between Captain Schuyler and Revolutionary War hero Gen. Philip
Schuyler, whose mansion on Catherine Street along South Pearl loomed over
the captain's old properties.</font>
<p><font size=+1>``Some historians have confused the captain with a white
man named Samuel Schuyler from that period,'' Bielinski said.&nbsp; He
added that General Schuyler owned 13 slaves at one time, the city's largest
slaveholder.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Was Captain Schuyler an emancipated Schuyler family slave?&nbsp;
Did he have a Schuyler parent or ancestor?&nbsp; Bielinski is left only
with unanswered questions.</font>
<p><font size=+1>It was natural for Captain Schuyler to settle in the South
End, as future generations of new arrivals would.&nbsp; ``The South End
was where newcomers from many ethnic backgrounds settled, got established
and maybe started up a business,'' Bielinski said.&nbsp; ``That's been
true for 200 years or more, and it's true today.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>Captain Schuyler's sons gave their father the prominence
history books never did.&nbsp; They erected a considerable monument to
his memory in the family plot at Albany Rural Cemetery.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>Revolutionary soldier</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Another italicized free person of color whose life Bielinski
has reconstructed is Benjamin Lattimore.&nbsp; Lattimore was born in 1761
and grew up in Wethersfield, Conn.&nbsp; As a teenager, he moved to Ulster
County and ran a ferry with his family on the Hudson River.&nbsp; At 15,
Lattimore joined the Revolutionary army and fought in the battle for New
York City, but he was taken prisoner by the British for a time.</font>
<p><font size=+1>During the war, Lattimore's regiment spent several weeks
in Albany, and he befriended a number of soldiers who later became neighbors
in Albany.&nbsp; Lattimore came to Albany for good in the 1790s, supporting
himself as a teamster who bought a city license to cart cargo around downtown.</font>
<p><font size=+1>By 1798, Lattimore had saved enough money to purchase
a lot west of South Pearl Street and build a two-story brick row house
there (roughly on the site of today's Pepsi Arena).&nbsp; He soon bought
more property on South Pearl, a main city thoroughfare.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Lattimore was baptized in the First Presbyterian Church
in 1799.&nbsp; His wife and their children were church members, too.&nbsp;
During the 1830s, Lattimore was president of the Albany African Temperance
Society and was described as a man ``of irreproachable character and uprightness.''&nbsp;
He died in 1838 at age 78.</font>
<p><b><font size=+1>First purchase</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>The black person who continues to fascinate Bielinski
most deeply is Dinah Jackson, ``a free negro woman'' who became the city's
first recorded property owner of African ancestry with her 1779 purchase
of a lot north of the city.&nbsp; By 1814, Jackson moved to 31 Maiden Lane,
a back street where several free black families lived.&nbsp; She worked
as a cleaning lady at the Masonic Lodge and St. Peter's Episcopal Church
on State Street.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Jackson's thriftiness blossomed.&nbsp; Eventually, she
owned seven lots on Arbor Hill in the city's northwest corner.&nbsp; She
died in 1818, having outlived her children, and bequeathed her properties
to her six grandchildren.&nbsp; Each day in his State Museum office, Bielinski
looks upon a print of a watercolor by James Eights depicting Albany in
the early 1800s. Eights painted the East side of Market Street (what is
Broadway today, between Maiden Lane and State Street).&nbsp; In one corner
of the painting, a woman strolls the cobblestone street in a long, blue
dress cinched at the waist.&nbsp; She is a black woman.</font>
<p><font size=+1>``I just have a gut feeling that the woman in Eights'
painting is Dinah Jackson,'' Bielinski said. ``That's her neighborhood.&nbsp;
She walked that street every day.&nbsp; I believe it's her.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>Not only has Bielinski given back their history to those
invisible citizens of Albany's past.&nbsp; In Jackson's case, he has given
her a face, as well.</font></blockquote>
