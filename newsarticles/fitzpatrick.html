<p><b><font size=+3>312-YEAR-OLD DOCUMENT SHAPES CITY'S GOVERNMENT</font></b>
<p><font size=+2>Albany Dongan Charter sits on a shelf in a vault at the
County Hall of Records, and few know about it</font>

<blockquote><font size=+1>It hasn't been on display in years. Most of the
time, it just sits on a shelf in a vault at the Albany County Hall of Records.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But Albany's charter, the 312-year-old document that shapes
city government and its power structure, hasn't been forgotten.</font>
<p><font size=+1>&nbsp;``It's still here, and they're still arguing over
it after all these years,'' County Clerk Thomas G. Clingan said Tuesday
as he viewed the document. ``The average person knowledgeable about city
affairs doesn't even know it's there.''</font>
<p><font size=+1>The oldest city charter in force in the United States
is arguably the longest-running instrument of municipal government in the
Western Hemisphere, according to Stefan Bielinski, author of ``Government
by the People,'' a 64-page book written to mark Albany's Tricentennial
in 1986.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The charter was on display for the Tricentennial celebration,
said Mary Wallen, executive director of the Hall of Records, a joint city-county
program at 250 S. Pearl St. It's been in the vault since then, along with
old books and court records, some of which are written in Dutch.</font>
<p><font size=+1>``I'm assuming it might get some attention this year,''
Wallen said of the charter.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Clingan said the charter is believed to be one of a kind,
and it's all but uninsurable because it could not be replaced. ``It's probably
among the most valuable things we have here,'' he said.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The charter, now encased in protective glass and a walnut
frame, is written out in script on parchment, 25 inches wide and 23 inches
tall. The writing is faded in spots, but the signature of Thomas Dongan,
the British governor of Colonial New York, is clearly visible at the bottom.
Below it is the governor's seal, affixed with tan and blue strands.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Dongan was an Irish-born career soldier who was commissioned
as New York's first royal governor. His charter for Albany gave the British
a much stronger tie with settlers of the Hudson Valley, but it also gave
the residents of Albany long-sought trading and property rights. ``From
the beginning, the Charter pleased all those directly concerned,'' Bielinski
wrote.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In recent years, however, some have called it outdated.
Officials have agreed on the need for a change, though they differ on details.
In any case, the Nov. 3 vote will not the invalidate venerable document:</font>
<p><font size=+1>``There is some historical significance to having the
oldest existing city charter in the country,'' said Stephen J. Rehfuss,
the charter commission chairman. ``Out of respect for the document and
its history, we decided it would be best to amend it, and not abolish it.
It will still be the Dongan Charter.''</font></blockquote>
