<p><b><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+3>A DISGRACED LEADER RETURNS TO
ALBANY AFTER 219 YEARS</font></font></b>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>PAUL GRONDAHL Staff writer</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>It has been a long separation
from his hometown for Albany's 26th mayor.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>It has been 219 years to be precise.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>But Abraham Cornelis Cuyler is back
in City Hall, even if he's not smiling.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Bowers After being arrested and
run out of town in disgrace during the Revolutionary War for his Tory sympathies
his property was confiscated, including his home on North Pearl Street
and all its furnishings Cuyler put Albany far, far behind him.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Following a confinement by the revolutionists
in Hartford, Conn., Cuyler, who had been colonel of the Albany militia,
escaped and joined the British forces.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Refusing to support the revolution,
Cuyler's wife, Jannetje, and their five children fled Albany in 1778, apparently
smuggling out the family portraits.&nbsp; The family later reunited and
eventually resettled in Canada. Subsequent generations of Cuylers ventured
to South Africa, where they exploited slave labor to drive a prosperous
plantation.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>All the while, in the mayor's conference
room at Albany's City Hall, where portraits of the city's mayors are hung,
the frame for Abraham Cornelis Cuyler remained empty.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Consider Cuyler's offense.&nbsp;
It was early June 1776. Cuyler was in a party mood.&nbsp; The 38th birthday
of England's King George III, born on June 4, 1738, was approaching.&nbsp;
Cuyler wound up at Richard Cartwright's Tavern in Albany.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The mayor apparently began drinking.&nbsp;
After several mugs of grog, presumably, Cuyler, sufficiently uninhibited,
began raucous and noisy toastings to King George III's birthday.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>This was a bad idea in Revolutionary-era
Albany.&nbsp; Cuyler paid dearly for his Loyalist outburst.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>``He sure stirred up the populist
sentiment. It was a case of very bad judgment,'' says Virginia Bowers,
the city of Albany's historian, who pieced together the Cuyler puzzle with
months of detective work and a correspondence with Cuyler's descendants
in, of all places, Albany, South Africa.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Bowers will present photographs
of period portraits of Cuyler and his wife, portraits that are in the collection
of a South African museum, to Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings, so that the
photographs may be hung in the mayor's room portrait gallery.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>``After an absence of more than
200 years, they return to Albany, New York, from Albany, South Africa,
with my best wishes,'' writes A.J. Mullins, a distant descendant of Cuyler
who lives in South Africa and with whom Bowers corresponded in tracking
down the Cuyler portraits.&nbsp; ``I love a happy ending,'' Bowers says.&nbsp;
``It was great the way everything fell into place.''</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Despite his political gaffe in the
tavern, Abraham Cornelis Cuyler was a pillar of the Albany community in
pre-Revolutionary War days.&nbsp; Both his father (Cornelis Cuyler) and
grandfather (Johannes Cuyler) also were mayors of Albany. At that time,
the city's mayor was an annual appointment made by the British Royal Commission.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>``The Cuylers came late to Albany
and worked twice as hard in the fur trade as the Schuylers and Ten Broecks
to become prosperous,'' says Stefan Bielinski, director of the <i>Colonial
Albany Social History Project</i> at the State Museum.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>``Although they were Dutch, the
Cuylers were products of the British system and did very well under the
British, which is the only way I can account for them being Loyalists and
appointed mayors by the British,'' Bielinski says.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Abraham Cornelis Cuyler, before
being run out of town, was the last mayor appointed by the British.&nbsp;
Cuyler is a central character in the opening of Bielinski's book-in-progress,
``The Other Revolutionaries,'' a study in the new social history that views
history from the bottom up.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Bielinski begins his book with Cuyler
drinking to the king's health in a chapter titled ``The Beginning of the
End,'' using the story to illustrate the last hurrah for the British system
in Albany.&nbsp; ``There were accounts that Cuyler tried to come back to
live in Albany after the Revolution, but his neighbors and former friends
were very unfriendly,'' Bielinski says.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>That wasn't the last word on the
Cuylers, though. A son of the 26th mayor, Jacob Glen Cuyler, was a colonel
with the British Army, participated in the occupation of South Africa and
became commandant of Fort Frederick along Algoa Bay.&nbsp; Jacob Glen was
among the first British settlers of that region and renamed it Albany after
his birthplace apparently harboring no hard feelings for being driven out
of his hometown.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Col. Jacob Glen Cuyler makes an
appearance in James Michener's exhaustive historical novel of South Africa,
``The Covenant.'' Michener writes of Cuyler, ``A man of courage and intelligence,
he prospered in the new colony, rising to rank of colonel and magistrate
of a large district south of Graaff-Reinet.&nbsp; He was a foe of revolutionaries.&nbsp;
They had driven him from his home in America and left him with indelible
memories: When he came to South Africa he brought with him two handsome
portraits, completed shortly before his death by Major Andre, who lived
with the Cuylers before his execution as an English spy.''</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Michener continues with a long description
of Cuyler's carrying out the hangings of five men at Slagter's Nek, ``the
soul-wrenching thing that happened.''</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Col. One descendant makes an appearance
in James Michener's ``The Covenant.''</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Four of the five survived the first
attempt when the ropes broke. Despite pleadings from the locals, who believed
it was a sign from God that the four should be spared, Cuyler had the quartet
strung up again. This time, the ropes did their intended work.&nbsp; Michener
writes, ``He had a job to do, a revolution to quell. Having been driven
away from Albany, he understood the terror that could engulf a land when
revolutionary ideas were allowed to gallop across a countryside, and he
intended having none of that in Africa.''</font></font>
