<p><b><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+3>TAKE A PEEK INTO ALBANY'S RICH
PAST</font></font></b>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>FRED LEBRUN</font></font>
<blockquote><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>To archaeologists, a year
passing doesn't normally count for much.&nbsp; Not even a thin layer of
dirt to sift through.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Yet what a difference a year has
made to archaeology as it is practiced and respected in the city of Albany.&nbsp;
Last November, the $25 million State Dormitory Authority building on Broadway
was finally under construction after a long and bitter wrangle with archaeologists
over not allowing a proper dig in one of the oldest parts of the city to
happen before erection.&nbsp; Last week, at the invitation of Troy-based
archaeologist Karen Hartgen, I toured the extensive digs on the two city
blocks north of the old Union Station that will become the new Department
of the Environmental Conservation Department building, to be erected by
the Picotte Companies.&nbsp; Since Aug. 31 more than 1,500 citizens, schoolchildren
and the wandering curious have been welcomed and toured through the elaborate
excavations that have laid bare the cities upon cities created here since
1750.&nbsp; There was no human habitation on this spot before then at what
would have been the deep gorge of the Vosenkill -- Fox Creek -- because
this area flooded substantially several times a year.&nbsp; Until fill
was brought in a wheelbarrow at a time to bring it up to buildable level.&nbsp;
Quite a feat of perseverance over many years of hand labor.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>``Like I promised,'' said a smiling
Karen Hartgen, ``the true banks of the Hudson River, around 1750.''&nbsp;
We were deep in a sharply defined trench carved by a backhoe and then refined
by trowel.&nbsp; A time line of history was before us.&nbsp; The layers
of fill down to the native clay, which then took a dip to an unmistakable
sandy beach.&nbsp; At the edge of the beach there were still shells and
broken dishes -- the shoreline trash of two and half centuries ago.&nbsp;
A few yards away, an archaeologist was carefully removing fill from around
the stacked logs of what is believed to be the first dock on the river
at the mouth of Fox Creek.&nbsp; We were more than 20 feet below what is
now considered street level, and only about 200 yards from Broadway.&nbsp;
It was five times that from the remains of the dock to where the river's
edge is today.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>``This is Urban Archaeology University,''
effused historian Stefan Bielinski, whose specialty is the people of Colonial
Albany.&nbsp; ``This is a WPA project for the culturally interested, ''
referring to the dozens and dozens of volunteers and students caught up
in the hands-on part of archaeology.&nbsp; He's very high on what's going
on here.&nbsp; ``They're doing it right,'' said Bielinski. Compared to
what, he didn't have to say.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The Picotte Companies are to be
applauded for bringing in the Hartgen team, including project director
Bob Bouchard, and then for extending the dig time for another month after
it was clear there was a treasure trove under there. Archaeological treasures,
to be sure. Sifting through the wet remains of old privies for broken bits
of history is not everyone's cup of tea.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>Officially, all tours of the digs
are done now.&nbsp; Time runs out for the archaeologists on Nov. 20.&nbsp;
But there's so much there to see I still recommend strongly to those who
haven't been down to take a look.&nbsp; Even if it only from the street.&nbsp;
Check out all the foundations, the brick work, the cisterns. Imagine the
people walking in and out of these buildings before the great fire of August
1797.&nbsp; It's easy to do.</font></font>
<p><font face="CG Omega"><font size=+1>The state's Office of General Services
is at this moment in the design phase of the actual building, a design
we strongly hope will incorporate in one way or another working parts of
this amazing history being unearthed.&nbsp; How is beyond my capacity to
wonder. But including Albany's rich past in its future will keep the wonder
of it alive.&nbsp; Our bare roots are an enormous asset to be tapped.</font></font></blockquote>
