<p><a href="#ext"><img src="gifs/drc.gif" width=250 hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 align=left alt="Dutch Church - intersection of State Street and Broadway"></a>The 
<a href="#sources">Dutch Reformed Church</a> was the centerpiece of  <a href="nnd.html">Dutch</a> culture in early Albany and its predecessor the village of <a href="beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. The church building itself was the most prominent feature on the community <a href="drcimage.html">landscape</a>. It was situated in the middle of the city’s main intersection from the 1650s to 1806. Previously, services had been held in a building owned by the <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Patroon</a> and located near <a href="loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>. Enlarged about 1715, the Dutch church shown on the left, and in all contemporary community iconography, was the largest building in colonial Albany and was <a href="art/kalm.html#341">described</a> by a number of visitors. The Dutch church clearly was colonial Albany's <a href="im/imecourt.html">premier</a> social institution!</p> 

<p>Staffed continuously by a European-born <a href="#domine">domine</a> or minister, the Albany Dutch church represented continuity with the past and stability. Its lay leaders or <a href="#deacons">Deacons</a> were among the <a href="cityfathers.html">most prominent</a> Albany businessmen and officials. <a href="#interior"><img src="images/jpg/drcinterior.jpg" width=200 hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 align=right alt="Interior of the Dutch Church"></a> Well-supported by these worthies, by more typical, rank-and-file city people, and by those in the countryside until Reformed Churches were built in <a href="na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, <a href="na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>, Catskill, and <a  href="na/sgtke.html#church">Schaghticoke</a>, the Albany Dutch Church also provided poor  relief, buried the <a href="dead.html#drc">dead</a>, sponsored missionary work among Native peoples, and often served members of other congregations whose houses of worship were less well-established. Regardless of ethnicity, most early Albany families received some needed  service from the Dutch Church.</p>
<a name=north></a>
<p>The North <a href="streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> Dutch <a href="im/imepearlchurch.html">church</a>  was opened in 1798 and replaced the old structure which was torn down in 1806. By that time, a <a href="#second">second</a> Reformed congregation was serving the south side of a booming city. Other Reformed churches followed in other parts of the city but the North church serves today under the banner of the <a href="http://www.firstchurchinalbany.org/">First Church in Albany</a>! 

<p>In 1815, the newspaper published an article on the division of the Reformed churches which included a list of those churchmen serving on the "<a href="org/grconsistory.html">Great Consistory</a>." 

<p>At some time during the seventeenth century, the church took title to a large tract of flood plain land in the southeastern quadrant of the city. For good reason, it was known as "the Pastures" and was intended to provide the church with a source of income. In 1815, the church deeded "the Pastures" back to the city and it was immediately marked for development. Today it is called <a href="loc/southend.html">the South End</a>."

<p><a href="doc/sl1825drc.html">In September 1825, a list</a> of those resident/parishioners subscribing to endowing a third professorship at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary contained the names of Albany's most prominent Dutch ancestry personages and the amount each subscribed.

<p>This sketch is mostly concerned with the <a href="criteria.html">membership</a> of the church and with its role as a community-based social and economic institution. Perhaps it will one day responsibly address the core community question regarding the place of religion in the actual lives of the people of colonial Albany. It cannot do justice to liturgical and spiritual matters - only partially because most surviving information comes from official church sources, from the perspective of its <a href="#list">ordained</a> leadership, and from the impressions of <a href="res/visitors.html">visitors</a>. However, it was an extremely important part of the Albany community during its formative years. In the beginning, and for most of the pre-Revolutionary era, the Dutch church represented the most important and often only spiritual identity for the community and its ever-growing hinterland. <a name=list></a>

        <p><a name=ext></a><a name=interior></a><b>Engraving</b> of a drawing 
            or painting of the Dutch church located in the intersection of State 
            and Market Streets is of unknown origins. Perhaps the earliest representation 
            of it comes from the streetscapes produced by Albany-born scientist 
            and artist <a href="bios/e/jaeights2036.html">James Eights</a>. This 
            particular engraving was photographed from The <a href="../../sources.html#ht"><i>Bicentennial 
            History of Albany</i></a>. The engraving of the rendering of the <b>interior</b> 
            of the State Street church was printed in Weise's <a href="books.html#we"><i>History 
            of Albany</i></a>. Many versions of both likenesses have appeared 
            in print over the past 150 plus years. We have not researched the 
            history of these images but the print collections of the Albany Institute 
            of History and Art and the First Church itself would be likely places 
            to start.</p>
          <p>The <a name=domine></a><b>Domine</b> was an ordained minister of 
            the Dutch Reformed Church sent by the church leadership in Holland 
            to minister to the Albany congregation. Beginning with the tenure 
            of Gideon Schaets in 1652, the Albany Reformed Church was served continuously 
            by a Dutch Reformed domine. When a domine died in Albany (which happened 
            several times), a new minister was called immediately. On several 
            occasions, two domines shared the Albany pulpit. Westerlo's <a href="bios/w/ewesterlo.html#rn"><i>Memoirs</i></a> provides insight on the domine's activities.</p>
          <p>The <a name=deacons></a><B>Deacons</b> were church officers elected 
            by the congregation to oversee and take charge of all church business. 
            These community leaders represented the will of the congregation in 
            church affairs. Church finances, contract work, later real estate 
            transactions, dealings with government and the courts, calling of 
            new ministers and all other non-spiritual matters were their major 
            responsibilities.</p>

<a name=sexton></a> 
        <p>The Sexton was employed to care for the church and grounds. His responsibilities 
          included ringing the bell and digging graves. Here is a partial list 
          of church sextons: <a href="bios/b/anbbradt4197.html">Anthony B. Bradt</a>; 
          <a href="bios/r/heroseboom1622.html">Hendrick Roseboom</a>; <a href="bios/b/barbradt4212.html">Barent 
          Bradt</a>; <a href="bios/r/jaradcliff1049.html">Jacobus Radcliff</a> 
          (1729-66); <a href="bios/b/babogert6081.html">Barent Bogert</a>. 
        <p><a name=second></a>The <b>Second Reformed Church</b> officially split 
          off from the First Church in 1815. However, the cornerstone of the new 
          church located on the site of the former church <a href="dead.html">cemetery</a> 
          (between Beaver and Hudson Streets) was laid in 1806. First called the 
          "South" and then the "Middle" Dutch church, that building served until 
          1881 when a new church was built on the corner of Swan Street and Madison 
          Avenue.</p>
