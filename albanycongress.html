<p><b>T</b>he <b>Albany Congress</b> met in Albany from June 19 to July 11, 1754. Holding daily meetings at the <a href="loc/cityhall.html">City Hall</a>, official delegates from seven colonies considered strategies for Indian diplomacy and put forth the so-called <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/albany.asp">Albany Plan of Union</a>.

<p>Unsure of its authority to participate, the <a href="#prov">province</a> of New York sent only an unofficial delegation which included Lieutenant Governor James De Lancey and two men with strong Albany connections, <a href="bios/j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> and <a href="bios/w/pwraxall.html">Peter Wraxall</a>. The Mohawks and other Native groups were represented at the meetings as well. <a href="bios/l/salivingston.html">Liv</a>ingston son-in-law <a href="bios/a/wmalexander.html">William Alexander</a> also attended representing his ailing father.</p>

        
      <p>Aside from its overall significance, the Albany Congress was a not unimportant 
        event in the history of Albany. The Albany meeting site pointed up Albany's 
        function as the <a href="map/kitchinmap.html">last outpost</a> of European-style 
        civilization before the frontier - a place where settlers, officials, 
        and native peoples had and would continue to <a href="furtrade.html">come together</a> to consider matters of mutual concern. Among the agendas for the convention, was a plan 
        to replace provincial Indian Commissioners with a Royal Superintendent 
        of Indian Affairs - which was aimed directly at the <a href="cia.html">Albany 
        Indian commissioners</a> who were seen by the British as self-interested 
        merchants whose core ambitions were antagonist to Imperial policy.</p>

<p>The meetings brought <a href="art/bfa.html">Benjamin Franklin</a> and other important Americans to Albany - <a href="newcomers.html">opening up</a> the inland community to the outside world. The trip was instructive for many of these colonial leaders. Over a month of intensive activity, the convention gave notoriously insular Albany people ranging from mayor <a href="bios/s/rosanders1443.html">Robert Sanders</a> and the <a href="cityfathers.html">city fathers</a> to the rank and file <a href="census1756.html">citizenry</a> their first prolonged contact with other Americans whose cultural heritage was substantially different from their own. For all concerned, the summer of 1754 provided images and lessons that many of them would not forget.</p>

<p>With the burning of <a href="na/hoos.html">Hoosick</a> just a month later by Canada based raiders triggering the <a href="7yw.html">resumption</a> of overt hostilities between the forces of France and Britain delegates, British officials, native peoples, and everyone in Albany itself had already been accorded a wake-up call to the dangers of unpreparedness and inaction. A long war would follow. 
   
<p>The Albany Congress has been accorded its place in most standard American history books and in virtually all the historical accounts of the history of Albany. It also has been the subject of two major <a href="#sources">monographic studies</a>. Unlike most of the heritage-inspired <a href="res/ts.html">narr</a>atives, these scholarly works begin to place the event[s] in some rational perspective!</p>

<p><a name=reason></a><b>History</b> of this item: A few months following the initial launch of this web adventure late in 1999, we received a number of enquiries from members of a (momentarily forgotten but out-of-state) elementary school social studies class asking questions about the Albany Congress. After the first batch of these queries (thankfully all received before I could  respond to them individually), I decided to create a webpage on this major point of interest for the history of early Albany. At that time, the existing <a href="res/irs.html">web-based</a>         offerings were sparse and skeletal. From it we learned that the <a href="res/irs.html">Internet</a> offered great promise in our driving goal to present the story of the people of colonial Albany and their world to diverse and wide-ranging <a href="guide/intro.html#aud">audiences</a>. Hundreds of people viewed the page it the first month. Next, the then existing online presentations were wholly inadequate in terms of reliably relating the story and also would not be very useful to us as they had essentially ignored the early Albany <a href="res/context.html">context</a>. Looking back on the Congress (and on the subsequent scholarship), I suspect that our unique contribution to the topic comes with our ongoing work on the community context (maybe stage) for the month long event and with our ability to work with Tim Shannon during the early stages of became a pretty satisfying monograph. However, we <a href="inprog.html">hope to be able to link</a> the people of colonial Albany more to that event in the future. The Loudoun <a href="census1756.html">census</a> of 1756 provides a handy roster of those involved on the Albany side.

      <p><a name=prov></a><b>Province of New York</b>: The eastern part of the 
        entity that became New York State in 1776 existed in several of geopolitical 
        incarnations after it ceased to be <a href="nnd.html">New Netherland</a> 
        in 1664. By the 1750s, it was a royal province and part of the worldwide 
        British Empire. This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Province_of_New_York">link</a> 
        introduces a <a href="res/ts.html">trad</a>itional approach to the general 
        topic. A simple Google search under <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22colonial+new+york%22">New 
        York Colony</a> provides access to several generations of scholarship 
        of all degrees of usefulness (a polite word) that I personally have found 
        less and less useful as the last four decades have unfolded. My advice 
        for learning about this region (all of New York) in that time (until and 
        through the <a href="or/or-3r.html">Revolutions</a>) is to focus on a 
        topic and/interest and learn about it from the bottom up and from the 
        inside out - or <a href="art/art-bbpast.html">otherwise</a> "on its own 
        terms." </p>
