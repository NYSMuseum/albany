<p><blockquote><FONT size=-1><B>F</B>rom Albany's earliest days, city streets radiated from the State 
        Street - Market/Court Street intersection. Listed below are early Albany's 
        principal streets with some useful notes and information. City maps (particularly 
        the <A href="map/mapdewitt.html">base maps</A> made by Simeon De Witt 
        in the 1790s) and the historical paintings of <A href="victorian.html#eights">James 
        Eights</A> and <A href="http://www.lftantillo.com/">Len Tantillo</A> provide 
        more perspective on the fabric of Albany's streets and the character of 
        <A href="peoplestreet.html">street life</A>. The street-by-street discussion that follows appears in rough order of importance!

<P><A name=state></a><a href="loc/edownstate.html"><font size=+1><B>STATE STREET:</B></font size></a> Albany's main street for more than 300 years. <a href="res/sp.html">S</a>ometimes referred to as "Yonker" or "Jonker" Street, State Street ran west from the Hudson River, across Market/Court streets, uphill - through a <a href="loc/elmtreecorner.html">main intersection</a> at Pearl Street, around the <a href="loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>, and ended at today's <A href="streets.html#eagle">Eagle Street</A>. Above Market Street, this wide boulevard (150 feet) was lined with the city's best houses - the <a href="loc/schuylerhouse.html">homes</a> of many of Albany's founders and principal personages. By the eighteenth century, these town houses <a href="map/bogertmap.html">lined both sides</a> of the street.
<br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, passage up State Street was obstructed 
            by three large structures located in the middle of the street: The 
            Dutch <A href="drc.html">Reformed Church</A> (at the intersection 
            with Market/Court streets), <A href="stpeters.html">St. Peters</A>, 
            and the <A href="loc/fortalbany.html">fort</A> all were located in 
            its median. By 1810, those structures had been removed and replaced 
            by a parking strip for wagons and carts. An <a href="loc/statestreet.html">image 
            map</a> further articulates State Street in 1790. <a name=lowerstate></a> 
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The house numbers below thirty describe the small buildings on the first two blocks of State Street from the river to Market Street. Some of these structures are shown on Len Tantillo's <a href="loc/experiment.html">panorama</a> of the Albany waterfront in 1787. 


          <P><A name=market></a><b><A href="im/imemarket.html">MARKET STREET</A>:</B> Originally 
            ran north from the <A href="images/jpg/drc.jpg">Dutch Church</A> and 
            was parallel to the Hudson River - continuing out to the <a href="na/vrmh.html">Van 
            Rensselaer Manor House</a>, <a href="na/schuylerflats.html">Schuyler 
            Flats</a>, and beyond. During the colonial period, it was the most 
            <a href="im/im1686.html">densely developed</a> Albany street. By the 
            era of the American Revolution, the homes/shops/stores of many Albany 
            leaders were located on both sides of the street north to today's 
            Steuben Street. <a href="bios/vp/cavplanck.html">Widow Schuyler</a>'s 
            house on the east side of Market at Steuben remained in the family 
            for more than a hundred years. Across the street, was the landmark 
            home of businessman <a href="bios/v/dihvisscher4067.html">Dirck Harmanse 
            Visscher</a> The next block north is the subject of an <a href="im/immktstcol.html">image 
            map</a> from an engraving. The west side of the block running north 
            from State has been articulated as a <a href="loc/marketstreet.html#2">cityscape</a>. 
            <br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the eighteenth century, <a href="loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a> was in the heart of the early Albany business district. About 1765, a large <A href="loc/markethouse.html">market house</A> was built in the middle of the street near Maiden Lane. By the end of the century, the block between Steuben and Columbia streets was <a href="im/immktstcol.html">densely settled</a>. But already, the smaller homes of tradesmen and transporters were beginning to fill in along the street as it ran north - out of the city and into <a href="na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A number of houses and other structures along Market Street were destroyed by <a href="doc/fire1797.html#market">fire</a> in August 1797. In 1813, Widow <a href="bios/r/chroff.html">Roff's</a> grocery on the east side at <A href="streets.html#patroon">Patroon</A> was called "1 Market Street." After the <A href="citylimits.html">city's borders</A> were extended north into Watervliet, Roff's house became 219 North Market. A year later, Market was redefined as North Market Street and South Market - formerly Court Street. South Market Street extended across State Street, through the pastures, and ultimately to the city's southern border at <a  href="na/castle.html">Castle Island</a>.

<A name=court></a><br>
          <P><B><a href="im/imecourt.html">COURT STREET</a>:</B> Originally a 
            short street of two blocks that ran south from the <a href="drc.html">Dutch 
            Church</a> to the <A href="loc/cityhall.html">City Hall</A>. Old Court 
            Street was intersected by narrow Beaver and Hudson Streets that provided 
            access to the waterfront. Beyond Hudson, Court Street opened out on 
            to the flood plain as it ran past the ruins of old <a href="loc/fortorange.html">Fort 
            Orange</a>. During the 1790s, the street was straightened and extended 
            south into the pastures. In 1815, it was renamed South Market Street 
            Today, it is called Broadway. During the seventeenth century, Court 
            Street was the <A href="loc/court.html">center</A> of the city's political 
            and commercial life. By the mid-eighteenth century, it was defined 
            by the enlarged church and city hall and included the now smaller 
            homes of business and tradesmen as the city elite had mostly relocated 
            along State and Market Streets.</P> 

<A name=pearl></a>
<br>
<P><B><a href="homes.html#ewp">PEARL STREET</a>:</B> A traditional residential street that ran north from the <A href="loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm Tree Corner</A>, across Maiden Lane, Steuben, and Columbia Streets. For more than a century, Pearl Street was home to the <A href="bios/l/lansing.html">Lansings</A>, <a href="bios/b/bleecker.html">Bleeckers</a>, <a href="bios/c/cuyler.html">Cuylers</a>, <a href="bios/r/roseboom.html">Rosebooms</a>, and other prominent early Albany families. <a href="loc/vdhpalace.html">Vanderheyden Palace</a> was its most outstanding residence. Pearl extended north through the stockade at <a href="bios/r/heroseboom1622.html">Roseboom's Gate</a>! It continued down into the <a href="loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> Ravine where it was lined with <a href="im/imepearlchurch.html">working class homes</a>. The opening of the <A href="drc.html">new Dutch Church</A> in 1798 extended residential development on Pearl Street to the <a href="citylimits.html">city line</a> and beyond. Pearl Street was re-named North Pearl about 1814 and continued north - converging with North Market Street beyond the        <a href="na/vrmh.html">Van Rensselaer Manor House</a>.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Early nineteenth-century Pearl Street is the subject of a number of cityscape <a href="victorian.html#eights">paintings</a> by James Eights. One of these watercolors depicts the <a href="im/imepearl.html">east side</a> of Pearl Street south from Steuben about 1812.<p></P>

<P><a name=southpearl></a><a href="im/imspearldiag.html"><b>SOUTH PEARL STREET</b></a>: Originally, a path running from State Street - south to the Pastures. Modest homes were laid out along it south to the stockade beginning in the early 1700s. It ran along the foot of <a href="loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>. From the stockade at <a href="#hudson">Hudson Street</a> - south to the <a href="loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>, that section 
              of the street first was settled following the death of property 
              owner <a href="bios/h/hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick Hallenbeck</a> in 1766. By the end of the War for Independence, it was called Washington Street reputedly because George Washington 
              walked along it to <a href="loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a> 
              in 1783. The street continued out of the city past Cherry Hill and 
              into <a href="na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. In 1815, it was 
              renamed <a href="im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> and 
              represented the principal southern route out of the city. The first 
              <a href="lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> and <a href="presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
              churches were located on this high street just south of State Street. 
              South Pearl Street was cut by both the <a href="loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> 
              and the Beaverkill. As a path for cattle headed for the Pastures, it was sometimes called "Cow Street."</p>

<P><a name=hudson></a><B><a href="im/im1800oake.html">HUDSON 
            STREET</a>:</B> Ran west from the river past <a href="loc/cityhall.html">city 
            hall</a>, across Court Street, <a href="#green">Green</a>, and South Pearl. Its route marked the southern line of the first city stockade. By the time of the Revolution, 
            close-set, working-class homes gave Hudson Street a settled quality that was 
            interrupted by the Dutch Reformed <a href="dead.html#drc">cemetery</a> located on the south side of the street between Green and South Pearl. By the early 1800s, Hudson 
            Street extended west as far as the Washington Park <a href="dead.html">cemetery</a>. Today it continues uptown to Allen Street and is called Hudson Avenue.</P>

<P><A name=green></a><B>GREEN STREET:</B> This narrow street ran south from State, through Beaver, Hudson, and Division Streets, across Lydius Street, and extended into the pastures. In 1771, the British publishers of the <a href="ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> corrupted the reference to "Queens Street." Before 1800, this narrow residential and service street was the heart of a working class neighborhood called "Cheapside."</P>

<P><A name=beaver></a><B>BEAVER STREET:</B> A narrow east-west street from Court, through Green Street, and ending on South Pearl Street near the Presbyterian Church and the Ruttenkill. Tradesmen, laborers, and tavern/innkeepers lived on eighteenth century Beaver Street. <a href="bios/c/ricartwright6508.html">Richard Cartwright's</a> house and King's Arms tavern were prominent features. The intersection of Beaver and Green Streets was the heart  of a working class neighborhood called "Cheapside" or "<a href="bios/vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a>." By the early 1800s, a number of multiple-residence dwellings (boardinghouses) were located on the street.</P>

<p><a name=nail></a><b>NAIL (Lutheran) STREET:</b> A narrow east-west street running uphill from the north side of the <a href="lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> on South Pearl, west- through Lodge and leading to Wendell's pastures. It was first shown on the <a href="im/im1770.html">Yates map</a> of 1770 but not named until the De Witt map. Today, it is called Howard Street.</p>

<P><A name=maiden></a><B>MAIDEN LANE:</B> A narrow east-west street beginning 
            at the Maiden Lane <a href="loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>, running across Dock, Market, Middle Alley, Pearl, Barrack, Lodge, behind the new <a href="loc/jail.html">jail</a>, and outletting onto the "<a href="loc/kingshighway.html">King's Highway</a>" or Schenectady Road (Lion Street - today's Washington Avenue). <a href="res/ts.html">Or</a>iginally called "Rom Street," Maiden Lane was a service street providing access to the backsides of the prominent homes and buildings on State, Market, and Pearl Streets. Stables, sheds, and some <a href="loc/edownstate.html">modest residential buildings</a> were located on Maiden Lane. For a time, Afro Albanian matriarch <a href="bios/j/djackson1074.html">Dinnah Jackson</a> lived at 31 Maiden Lane in a building behind the <a href="#market">Market Street</a> home of Chancellor <a href="bios/l/jolansing3755.html">John Lansing, Jr.</a>
			


<P><A name=steuben></a><B>STEUBEN STREET:</B> Ran west from the river - across Market <a href="im/immktstcol.html">and</a> Pearl and uphill to the <a href="loc/hospital.html">hospital</a>. Named for Baron Von Steuben, it marked the route of the northern leg of the first city stockade. We have not encountered a name for it before it was called "Steuben." A residential street where the <a href="loc/glenhouse.html">Glen (Cuyler) house</a> stood (at Chapel) as early as the 1720s.
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A number of houses and other structures along Steuben Street were destroyed by <a href="doc/fire1797.html#steuben">fire</a> in August 1797.


<P><A name=columbia></a><B>COLUMBIA STREET:</B> Ran west from the river near the <a href="im/im1770.html">north dock</a>. It was located along the ridge above the <a href="../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> ravine. It was a block north of the original stockade line and was built on during the mid-1700s. By the last decade of the eighteenth-century, it was a fringe residential street ending at North Pearl. Afterward, it extended farther uphill to <a href="#eagle">Eagle</a> Street.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A number of houses and other structures along lower Columbia Street were destroyed by <a href="doc/fire1797.html#columbia">fire</a> in August 1797.

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today, the Albany County Court House is located on the upper south side and some early nineteenth century buildings are nicely preserved along the north side of upper Columbia Street.

<P><A name=dock></a><B><a href="images/map1793.jpg">DOCK STREET</a>:</B> Evolved from a path along the Albany waterfront. By the <a href="im/im1770.html">1770s</a>, some buildings (including the new homes of sailmaker <a href="bios/e/abeights7800.html">Abraham Eights</a> and skipper <a href="bios/d/stdean.html">Stewart Dean</a>) had been built east of an informal road that ran from about Beaver Street north possibly to Columbia Street. It may have been the waterside route of convenience connecting the city docks. By the <a href="im/im1794.html">1790s</a>, it was a real road called "Dock Street" and connected Hudson and Steuben Streets. Dock Street was west of and parallel to <a href="#quay">Quay Street</a>.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A number of houses and other structures along Dock Street were destroyed by <a href="doc/fire1797.html#dock">fire</a> in August 1797. In 1826, it was re-named in honor of Captain  <a href="bios/d/stdean.html">Stewart Dean</a>.

<P><A name=middle></a><B>MIDDLE ALLEY:</B> A narrow, service street that ran north-south from Columbia to State Street. It was set between North Market and North Pearl Streets. It may also have been called the "Waggon Way." Today, it is called James Street - probably after early nineteenth century merchant and real estate mogul <a href="bios/j/wj.html">William James</a>. <a href="bios/b/shbogardus6387.html">Shibboleth Bogardus</a> was one of the few mainliners who actually lived on this street - owning a home at its north end in 1729.<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A number of houses and other structures along "Middle Lane" were destroyed by <a href="doc/fire1797.html#middle">fire</a> in August 1797.


<P><A name=lodge></a><B>LODGE STREET:</B> Ran north-south across State Street, across, Maiden Lane to the Masonic Hall, and to the <a href="loc/hospital.html">hospital</a>. South from State, it led to the Ruttenkill ravine.</P>

<P><A name=chapel></a><B>CHAPEL STREET:</B> Originally called <B>Barrack[s] Street</B>, it ran north from State Street across from <a href="stpeters.html">St. Peters</a>  to Fox Street. During the 1760s, lots were leased for land "where the barracks formerly stood." Later, the <a href="im/im1794.html">street</a> was continued north to Patroon Street. By the end of the War for Independence, it was a residential, back street and the home to a number of Scottish immigrants including carpenter <a href="bios/f/alforsyth5904.html">Alexander Forsyth</a>. </P>

<p><a name=division></a><b>DIVISION STREET:</b> Formerly called <b>Bone Lane</b>, it ran west from the river up to South Pearl Street between Hudson and Hamilton Streets. Maps show it to have been of variable widths. Probably it was not called Division Street until the 1800s. It was the first street south of the colonial stockade.</p>

<P><A name=lion></a><B>LION STREET:</B> The widest of the east-west "animal streets" first shown on the <a href="im/im1794.html">De Witt map</a> of 1794. "<a href="res/sp.html">L</a>yon Street" ran west from the <a href="loc/publicsq.html">Public Square</a> along the route of the <a href="loc/kingshighway.html">King's Highway</a> and today's Washington Avenue. Previously known as "King('s) Street" when lots were sold (leased) there in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=&f=false">August 1778</a>, by the 1790s, houses began to dot its route up to Lark Street. The assessment roll for <a href="guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> also valued the several dozen lots that had been laid out along its route. <a href="bios/b/sabromley5963.html">Samuel Bromley</a>'s inn located on the corner of Lion and Dove (later 140 Washington Avenue), also was shown on the De Witt map of 1794 and on the assessment roll as well.</P>

<P><A name=pine></a><B>PINE STREET:</B> Originally a short (east-west) cross street leading from the <a href="loc/publicsq.html">Public Square</a> to Barrack (Chapel) Street. Today, it continues east to North Pearl Street.</P>
            
          <P><A name=patroon></a><B>PATROON STREET:</B> Albany's original northern <a href="citylimits.html">boundary 
            line</a>, it ran from the river across Market Street along the path 
            of today's Clinton Avenue. It's name probably relates to it as a dividing 
            line between Albany and <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
            When the city line was extended north in 1815, the street name was 
            changed to Clinton Avenue. By the mid-nineteenth century, its was 
            one of Albany's most populated residential streets.</P>

          <P><A name=fox></a><B>FOX STREET:</B> Sometimes called the "Vozenkill," 
            Fox(es) Street ran west from North Pearl Street, across Chapel Street, 
            up the ravine, and along the route of <a href="loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
            Creek</a>. Later, the stream was piped and the street above was called 
            Canal Street. Today, it is Sheridan Avenue. Along the south side of 
            the street, a steep ravine kept Fox Street significantly "below" the 
            streets in the upper part of the core city. <a href="trades/tanner.html">Tanning</a> 
            pits lined the north side slope into the nineteenth century.</P>            

<P><A name=orange></a><B>ORANGE STREET:</B> Ran west from the river at the foot of the North Dock. Ran across Market; <a href="im/imepearlchurch.html">crossed</a> North Pearl Street; and continued uphill for many blocks. This street cut through the north side slope of <A href="loc/arborhill.html">Arbor Hill</A>. Above Lark Street, Orange Street once was known as Hare Street. By the late eighteenth century, the sections near where it crossed Market Street were closely settled mainly by recently arrived tradesmen, laborers, and by <a href="bios/w/wbwinne.html">Willie Winne</a> - the "penny postman" who lived at 57 Orange Street.</P>


<A name=vs></a><B>VAN SCHAICK STREET:</B> Ran <a href="im/imepearlchurch.html">west from</a> Pearl Street for two blocks between Fox and Orange Streets. It ran along the south side of the Pearl Street Dutch church. Not shown on early maps, it would have been a continuation of Van Tromp Street. It probably was named for <a href="bios/vs/gewvschaick3953.html">Gerrit W. Van Schaick</a> who owned a large tract of land along <a href="loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. During the first decades of the 19th century, it was densely inhabited by newcomers and transients living in cramped and crowed rooming houses. The stately home of Justice <a href="bios/b/pedbeekman3926.html">Peter D. Beekman</a> located at 21 Van Schaick stood in contrast to these ramshackle buildings. Today, it is called Monroe Street.

<P><A name=tromp></a><B>VAN TROMP:</B> A short, residential street running between North Pearl and Market Street along the south side of <a href="loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. It was laid out by <a href="im/im1770.html">1770</a>. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22van+tromp%22+albany&source=bl&ots=2hMyK1Wx2v&sig=XtMAT91BxYs2gesXRxvUaMn8Mng&hl=en&ei=dIcBS5--CpDrlAebwpGICw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA8Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=&f=false">1813</a>, eleven individuals with Tromp Street addresses were listed in the first city directory. Merchant <a href="bios/f/jofondajr.html">John Fondey, Jr.</a> lived at the Market Street corner. Van Tromp Street exists today in the same location!</p>   

<p><a name=eagle></a><b>EAGLE STREET</b>: Originally called "Queen Street," it was shown as Eagle Street on the De Witt map of 1790. This north-south street ran from today's Columbia to Morton Street and represented the westernmost "city street" during the eighteenth century. The <a href="loc/publicsq.html">Public Square</a> and first municipal <a href="dead.html#municipal">cemetery</a> were located west of it. 

          <p><a name=hal></a><b>HALLENBECK STREET:</b> Probably named after property owner 
            <a href="bios/h/hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick Hallenbeck</a> who 
            died in 1766, this wide boulevard ran north-south from about <a href="#plain">Plain</a> 
            Street to the <a href="loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. It first 
            was shown on the <a href="map/mapdewitt.html">De Witt map</a> of 1790 
            and named on the map of <a href="im/im1794.html">1794</a>. Perhaps 
            it served as the western boundary of the Hallenbeck lands! In 1818, 
            it still was called "Halenbake Street" and ran from Beaver Street 
            to the Beaverkill. By 1857, its name had been changed to Grand Street 
            - its present-day title.</p>

<p><a name=plain></a><b>PLAIN STREET:</b> Between Hudson and Hamilton, this side street ran west from <a href="im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl</a> up the <a  href="loc/gallowshill.html">hill</a> toward Eagle Street. In 1813, it was one of the streets that was to be <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA39,M1">paved</a>.  In that year, the city <a href="sources.html#ad">directory</a> showed nine Plain Street addresses. Today, it has been covered over by the Empire State Plaza Arterial.

<P><A name=lydius></a><B>LYDIUS STREET:</B> Probably a nineteenth century reference. Named for Dominie <a href="bios/l/jlydius4614.html">Johannes Lydius</a>, Lydius Street  ran west from the Hudson River along the route of today's Madison Avenue. Previously (1790), it was referenced in deeds and shown on the <a href="im/im1794.html">De Witt map</a> as "Wolf Street."  Later, the extension of this wagon road became the "Great Western Turnpike" - today's US Route 20. By the early 1800s, houses appeared along eastern Lydius Street forming several blocks below <a href="streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a>. Those numbered addresses appear in the earliest <a href="sources.html#ad">city directories</a>. Heading uphill above South Pearl, the address was "Lydius continued."</p>

<p><a name=norton></a><b>NORTON STREET:</b> Formerly called Church Street and, until <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=caMpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=%22norton+street%22+albany&source=bl&ots=AcH_5x8AvL&sig=jixHjziOcrzUA2ZMedr6iY4JY30&hl=en&ei=Cl8BSrjJGpuwMff9zOEH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8">1835</a>, Store Lane, it ran east from South Pearl Street and ended at Green Street. It is shown as "Nail Street" on the <a href="map/mapdewitt.html">De Witt maps</a>. The <a href="loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> ran beneath it near the <a href="presbyterian.html">Pr</a>esbyterian church. The street probably was named for a railroad executive named Norton (and not early Albany resident <a href="bios/n/sanorton.html">Samuel Norton</a>) whose offices later covered almost an entire side of the street.

In <a href="sources.html#ad">1813</a>, a number of cooperages had Mark Lane addresses. Subsequently, it was called "Exchange Street." Today, it is a driveway separating the "old" post office and the Federal Building on Broadway.</p>  

<p><a NAME=cow></a> <b>COW LANE</b>: The name of several north-south streets (originally "cow paths") leading to the Pastures in the <a href="loc/southend.html">South End</a> of Albany. The most often usage referenced the "Cow Lanes" that ran between <a href="#hudson">H</a>udson and the Pastures and is shown as a narrow pathway on the De Witt Map of <a href="im\im1794.html">1794</a>.

<p><a name=liberty></a><b>GRASS LANE</b>: Originally extended from Hudson to Lydius. By 1813, its name had been changed to <b>Liberty Street</b> - the name it retains today. In 1813, more than forty Liberty Street addresses were shown in the first <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA42,M1">city directory</a>.
        
<P><A name=montgomery></a><B>MONTGOMERY STREET:</B> Initially ran north-south from Steuben to Columbia Street and between Market Street and the river. Later, it extended north for many blocks into the heart of the lumber district. A number of houses and other structures along Montgomery Street were destroyed by <a href="doc/fire1797.html#mont">fire</a> in August 1797.

<P><a name=water></a><b>Water Street:</b> Ran parallel to the river and east of <a href="#market">North Market Street</a>. Exists today only for one block between <a href="#orange">O</a>range and <a href="#columbia">C</a>olumbia Streets.

            This pathway was shown but not labeled on the 1818 Van Allen map. 
            What came to be known as "Road Street" ran basically east to west 
            probably on the dry ground along the southern base of the <a href="loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
            Creek</a> ravine - perhaps veering off from today's Sheridan Avenue

The riverside edge of it became the city seawall. The land was reclaimed from the river bottom by filling in with dirt and other material carted from a variety of local locations. First identified by name on <a href="map/mapdewitt.html">city maps</a> about 1790, Quay was early Albany's <a href="images/jpg/mapdewittquay.jpg" width=600>easternmost street</a>. The island that would enclose the Albany basin and become the actual riverfront would be added by 1820. The third ward assessment roll for <a href="guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>  delineated ownership of property along the Quay.
