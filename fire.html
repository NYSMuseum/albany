<p>Downtown Albany was stirred from its Sunday evening slumber by the piercing 
  cries of "<a href="doc/fire1793.html">fire</a>!" &nbsp;Flames spreading from a stable owned by <a href="bios/g/leogans4666.html">Leonard Gansevoort</a> quickly consumed most of the wooden <a href="#map"><img src="images/jpg/dewitt1794.jpg" border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 height=130 width=107 align=left ALT="destroyed by fire in 1793"></a>buildings 
  in the block of <a href="loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a> bounded by 
  <a href="loc/estatemkt.html">State Street</a>, Middle Alley, and Maiden Lane. 
  The blaze was kept from engulfing the entire old city by spraying the still 
  unscathed Pearl Street homes with water passed along from nearby wells to fill 
  the city pumpers. Crews of residents chopped and cleared a number of frame structures 
  - thus forming a firebreak. Later, on that night of November 17, 1793, rain 
  fell, turned to sleet, and stifled the flames of Albany's first great fire. Another fire in <a href="doc/fire1797.html">1797</a>, destroyed several blocks in the <a href="loc/northend.html">North End</a> of the city.  

<p> Despite the vastness of land in the Hudson
Valley, Albany was born and built as a <a href="im/im1686.html">closely configured</a>, European-style,
almost medieval town. With city houses set so close to each other
and with additions, sheds, and other ramshackle structures attached to
the sides of most buildings, the threat of fire was a constant concern
for the people of colonial Albany. Potential fire hazards abounded.
Most <a href="homes.html">homes</a> were built of wood and every house had one or more chimneys that vented the fireplaces used for heating and cooking. And city
shops - particularly the bakeries and smithies located all over the
community, kept a flame alive even when no one was actually working.


<p> <a href="#rattle"><img SRC="images/jpg/rattles.jpg" border=1 ALT="Rattles" HSPACE=8 VSPACE=4 height=138 width=221 align=LEFT></a>Albany escaped the ravages of a community-enveloping blaze until 1793 mostly 
  through vigilance and simple prevention. From the earliest days, the city fathers 
  provided leadership by 
  enacting ordinances regulating the types of materials that could be used in 
  building (beginning with banning thatched roofs in the 1670s), by insisting 
  that streets and alleys be kept clear as "fire lanes", by restricting the storage 
  of hay and other combustibles, and by appointing <a href="firemasters.html">firemasters</a> 
  for each of the three wards who would watch for and report potential fire hazards. 
  Persistent violators could be and were fined. In addition, the city watchmen, 
  criers, and keepers of the rattlewatch, which prowled or patrolled the community 
  day and night until the nineteenth century, also encouraged their neighbors 
  to be mindful of the citizen's role in fire prevention.</p>
 
<p><a name=lansing></a><a href="#bucket"><img SRC="images/jpg/bucketwhandle.jpg" ALT="Fire Bucket" HSPACE=8 VSPACE=4 BORDER=1 height=180 width=110 align=LEFT></a>City planners understood that when a fire did break out, some 
  buildings would be lost. But dousing the adjacent buildings with water might 
  control the blaze. Although Albany was located 
  near an abundant supply of river water, carrying water inland (and uphill) was 
  a chronic problem whose solution initially was based on community cooperation. 
  Each householder had one or more leather fire buckets like that owned by Court 
  Street resident <a href="bios/l/ablansing3694.html">Abraham A. Lansing</a>. These could be used by so-called bucket brigades 
  as neighbors filled and passed them uphill to fill the fire pumpers of up ladders 
  so that they could be thrown on actual flames or even more likely on nearby, 
  vulnerable buildings. The firemasters also were instructed to ensure that the 
  city-owned fire ladders and hooks were maintained in strategic places. In that 
  way, colonial Albany survived several small fires and suffered no major fire 
  damage until 1793 - a testimony to civic pride and community cooperation.</p>
 
<p><a name=engine></a> In 1732, Albany took a great step forward in fire control when the common council 
  purchased a <a href="fireengine.html">fire engine</a> manufactured by Richard 
  Newsham of London. By that time, all of the larger early American cities had 
  invested in the Newsham engine. <a href="bios/l/rlansing3656.html">Robert Lansing</a>, 
  a prominent gunsmith, was given charge of the Albany pumper that was kept in 
  a shed built behind <a href="stpeters.html">St. Peter's Church</a> - representing 
  the highest elevation of settlement until the 1790s. During the 1790s, Albany 
  would purchase a second engine.</p>

<p> Unlike New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Charleston, Albany suffered no large fire during the Seven Years War or the War for Independence. Although protest fires were set in 1766 and, a decade later, the fear of Tory or Negro uprisings was constant, Albany was able to survive those troubled times - a testimony to the face-to-face nature of city life and a healthy respect for property and mutual well-being in a close-knit community.</p>

<p><a href="#enginehouse"><img src="images/jpg/bogertenginehse.jpg" align=left alt="the Engine House - 1792" hspace=8 vspace=4 border=1 width=250></a> In 1773, the city fathers codified fire regulations in the first published <a href="doc/laws.html#fire"><i>Laws and Ordinances</i></a> of the city of Albany.

<p> With the end of the war in 1783 and the opening of the frontier to settlement, Albany became an American boomtown. New settlement burst its stockaded colonial boundaries and spread along the river and up the hill - adding many new business, residence, and industrial blocks for a <a href="population.html">population</a> would multiply fifteen-fold before the Civil War. Some of the new Albanians were from European cities that had wrestled with
fire for centuries while others came from the American countryside where
fire fighting was more of an individual responsibility. At the same
time, Albany's traditional leaders were superceded by newcomers who, following two debilitating fires during the 1790s, recognized the need for fire protection beyond vigilance and neighborhood cooperation.
<p>This introductory, theme essay on an important community <a href="gallery.html">issue</a> is basic to understanding the realities of life in an early American community. It is very much <a href="inprog.html">in-progress</a>.</p>
