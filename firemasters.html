        <p><a href="#notes"><b>Firemasters</b></a> were appointed each year by 
          the Albany city <a href="corporation.html">council</a> (usually in early 
          November after the annual Charter elections that were held on September 
          29). Two firemasters were named for each of the city’s three <a href="wards.html">wards</a>.</p>
        <p>Most of these native sons (and some <a href="newcomers.html">newcomers</a> 
          as well) served a year or two during the time immediately preceding 
          their <a href="marriages.html">marriage</a> and establishment as full-fledged 
          members of the community. They were empowered to visit each home in 
          their ward and to seek out and report fire hazards. <a href="fire.html#lansing"><img src="images/jpg/bucketwhandle.jpg" align=left width=90 hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 alt="an Albany leather"></a> 
          Accompanied by an alderman or assistant, these inspections were to be 
          held every three weeks. Such responsibility introduced an emerging adult 
          to Albany householders, gave them a common useful experience, and helped 
          young men to appreciate and feel part of the community.</p>
        <p>Firemasters were charged with knowing how many "leathers" or fire buckets 
          were available, for taking charge of the common fire ladders and hooks, 
          and for guiding and leading their neighbors during an <a href="fire.html">actual 
          fire</a>. The vital role played by the firemasters typified the voluntary 
          and participatory nature of municipal government during the pre-industrial 
          era.</p>
<p>By the second half of the eighteenth century, the actual but rarely reported complete roster of firemasters or "firemen" was quite large and represented a significant proportion of the young men of the community. In July <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA144&lpg=PA144&dq">1763</a>, the city records <a href="org/cc.html#1763">posted</a> a list of Albany's thirty-one firemen arranged by ward. The printed <a href="doc/laws.html">laws and ordinances</a> of the city published in 1771 provided a <a href="doc/laws.html#fire">detailed description</a> of Albany's then current fire prevention and response program.

 		  
        <p>After the Revolution, municipal fire protection evolved into "fire 
          companies" with individual residents serving as "firemen." The term 
          "firemaster" then fell into disuse!</p>

        <P><font size=-1>Since notice of the annual appointment 
          of <b>firemasters</b> and later of firemen was entered into the common 
          council minutes, we have extracted that information and have made it 
          a part of each early Albany person's <a href="cbr.html">biographical 
          record</a>. In 1791, lists of fireman in fire companies were <a href="inprog.html">entered</a> 
          into the city records. 
        <dd>Follow <a href="org/cc.html">this link</a> to the names 
          of early Albany's firemasters as they appeared on the city roster for 
          each year.</font size> <br>
