<p><blockquote><b>I</b>n a relentless
quest to understand the human condition as embodied in the history of people
in communities, the <i><a href="whoarewe.html">Colonial Albany Social History
Project</a></i> strives to sustain three major areas of activity.

<p>We have identified and have categorized these areas as <a href="whoarewe.html#research">Research</a>, <a href="whoarewe.html#programs">Programming</a>, and <a href="whoarewe.html#service">Service</a>. We believe that each of them is equally important and each represents a <b>"number one"</b> project priority. However, we struggle in good faith to balance our energies in those distinct activity areas.

<p>The <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> is committed to presenting its findings on an on-going basis in a range of programs. Programs are defined as a calculated exposition of historical
information.

<p>Because they are designed by project staff and include measured quantities of historical information supporting a thesis and themes that are appropriate for specific audiences,
programs represent the project's best foot forward in presenting the story of the people of colonial Albany and their world.

<p>Programs including publications, lectures, and exhibitions are described in detail in the project's comprehensive primer known as "<a href="guide/titletable.html">The Guide</a>".

<p>At this point, the findings of
the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> are most easily accessed
via this <a href="welcome.html">website</a>.</blockquote>
