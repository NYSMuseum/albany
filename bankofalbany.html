<p>Established in 1792, the <b><a href="#sources">Bank of Albany</a></b> was the city's first banking institution and the second bank founded in New York State.</p>

<p>The so-called "Albany Bank" began operations at the City Tavern on September 17, 1792. Shares of stock were sold - sold out within three hours.</p>

<p>The Bank of Albany was incorporated by the state legislature on April 25, 1792. It was capitalized at $260,000 in maximum total assets. Its <a href="#directors">first directors</a> were elected in June.</p>

            new bank building on the west side of Market Street was opened for 
            business on July 20, 1795. In 1810, the bank moved to the northwest 
            corner of Broadway and State Street.</p>

<p> <a href="bios/vs/gewvschaick3953.html">Gerrit W. Van Schaick</a> was the first cashier of the bank - serving from 1792 to 1814. <a href="bios/vz/jovzandt286.html">John Van Zandt</a> served as cashier from 1814 to 1832. Merchant <a href="bios/w/jewinne2790.html">Jellis Winne, Jr.</a> was <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/yearbookofhollan26holl/yearbookofhollan26holl_djvu.txt">said</a> to have been cashier from 1832 until his death in 1849. The cashier was charged with handling deposits and disbursements and keeping records of all financial transactions and assets. Attorney <a href="bios/vi/javingen6426.html">James Van Ingen</a> was the bank's first clerk. 



<p>In April 1820, <a href="bios/b/barbleecker150.html">Barent Bleecker</a> was elected to succeed Van Schaick as president.

<p>Other banks followed making Albany a banking center. The Bank of Albany operated until 1861 when it "failed."</p>
