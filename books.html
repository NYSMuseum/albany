<br><font size=-1> &nbsp; &nbsp; This beautifully presented, illustrated history of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org">Albany Institute</a> dating to its eighteenth-century origins is, in some ways, an illustrated history of Albany's material culture.

    <dd><font size=-1>The latest historical work on Albany's earliest history. 
      Centered on material evidence, it is much much more and a perfect place

      <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/staffpubs/docs/20360.pdf">Online</a>

Largely biographical in focus and thankfully in English, this is <u>the</u> work on <a href="beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and destined to become the long-awaited foundation resource for subsequent histories of Albany. It is of inestimable value to the Colonial Albany Project in that the author has navigated the often-mysterious web of historical resources on the "pre-English language period" of early Albany history - thus permitting us to begin presenting the stories of those not born in America with much more confidence.</font><p></p>
