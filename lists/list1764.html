          <p>To the Right honourable the Lords Commissioners for Trade & Plantations. 
          <p>The petition of us the Subscribers being <a href="../furtrade.html">Indian 
            Traders</a> & Merc[hants] residing in The City and County of Albany 
            in America. 
          <p>Humbly Sheweth 
          <p>That your Petitioners as well as their Ancestors have for near a 
            Century and a half carried on a free trade with the Indians living 
            Westward of Albany under such regulations as have from time to time 
            been made by the Legislative Power of this Province, the last Twenty 
            Seven years of which time the said Trade was carried on under the 
            Inspection and Superintendence of a <a href="../bios/j/swj.html">Commissary</a> 
            thereunto appointed; agreeable to which regulations the trade whilst 
            centered at <a href="../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>, flourished without 
            any interruption by the Savages, or without being subject to any Prohibition 
            of Rum or other spirituous liquors, till the commencement of <a href="../7yw.html">hostilities</a> 
            by the French and Indians on the Ohio, in consequences whereof the 
            Traders being intimidated to risqué their effects in this Trade a 
            temporary stop was put thereto; But on the Declaration of War against 
            the French and subsequent thereto the glorious Acquisitions obtained 
            by His Majesty’s Armies in the reduction of Niagara and afterwards 
            Canada with its dependencies, encouraged your Petitioners to use their 
            endeavors in carrying on this valuable branch of Trade in a more extensive 
            manner than had hitherto been practized, tho in pursuit of this plan 
            your Petitioners by some new invented regulations were totally prohibited 
            from carrying rum and other spirituous liquors, the enforcement of 
            which regulations your Petitioners conceive was founded on a mistaken 
            notion, if not on some lucrative views; tho true it is that some of 
            the Five Nations have examined against the sale of rum amongst them, 
            yet it’s equally true that the other Tribes with whom your Petitioners 
            carry on a far more considerable Trade, look upon such a Petitioners 
            finding by Experience since this prohibition took place a considerable 
            decrease in the Trade which they can ascribe to no other reason than 
            such prohibition because when the Indians have nothing farther to 
            provide for than bare necessaries, a very small quantity of Furs in 
            Trade will abundantly supply that defect, Whereas when the Vent of 
            Liquors is allow’d amongst them, it spurs them on to an unwaried application 
            in hunting in order to supply the Trading Places with Furs and Skins 
            in Exchange for Liquors. 
          <p>Your Petitioners notwithstanding the Discouragements this Trade has 
            laid under (having first obtained passes for that purpose) have for 
            these three last years carried on said Trade with the remote Tribes 
            of Indians, at all or most of the different conquered stations now 
            under His Majesty’s Protection on this Executive Continent under the 
            arbitrary direction of the Commanders on the different stations, some 
            of whom being ignorant in Trade and unacquainted with the Indians, 
            obstructed the Traders and slighted the Indians, and tho’ the expence 
            and fatigue on such long trading voyages on the Lakes is very considerable 
            and labour very dear, yet with them as they have no proper idea of 
            labour, (traveling to them being little or no expence) they being 
            at home wherever they come. 
          <p>Your Petitioners beg leave farther to present that some or most of 
            your Petitioners last Summer coasting along the Lakes in pursuit of 
            this Trade, and others who had arrived at their respective destined 
            places of Trade were inhumanely set upon and attacked by those Savages 
            and several of their Fellow Traders murdered, their effects plundered 
            and some of your Petitioners led into captivity & otherwise treated 
            in the most cruel & barbarous manner, whereby they have been most 
            unhappy sufferers (when our new fellow subject the Canadians carried 
            on their trade at the same time and places without being in the least 
            molested the Dread of such treatment for the Future discourages your 
            Petitioners from pursing this branch of trade with their wonted alacrity. 
          <p>Your Lordship Petitioner beg leave farther to observe that unless 
            some salutary remedy be put in practice your Petitioners conceive 
            it may occasion a Stagnation in said Trade, on account of the Traders 
            in the prosecution of their voyages being all times obnoxious to such 
            treatment for the future, the Indians in such cases having a safe 
            retreat to the Mississippi, where it is the interest of the French 
            not only to protect but also to encourage them, To this may be further 
            observed that the different places of Trade are so far up in the interior 
            part of the Continent, that no sufficient caution can at all Times 
            be taken to guard against the occasional Excursions & Depredations 
            of those Savages. 
          <p>Your Petitioners therefore farther beg leave with all due submission 
            to your Lordships superior Judgment to present (in order to anticipate 
            the Cruelties, Losses & Misfortunes which your Petitioners hereafter 
            might be liable to, should the trade remain as it is) that Pittsburgh 
            Niagara Fort Williams Augusts & Cannusadago are the most conveniently 
            situated to center this Trade in. 
          <p>Your Petitioners therefore humbly pray in Consideration of the Inconveniencies 
            that this Trade as it now stands, is so eminently, exposed to, that 
            those Places for a general Resort to all His Majesty’s subjects be 
            expressly stipulated, and that non under the Places so fixed upon, 
            & that the same be under the Superintendency of some proper Person 
            or Persons duly authorized for that purpose and that there be no Prohibition 
            of Spiritous Liquors, without its being first duly enquired into, 
            whether it is detrimental to any of His Majesty’s Subjects; or to 
            do such other Things in the Proviences as the Urgency of your Petitioners 
            particular Care necessarily requires and your Lordships in your great 
            Wisdom shall think meet and convenient. <a name=names></a> 
          <p>And your Petitioners as in Duty bound shall ever pray &ca
