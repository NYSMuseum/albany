<p>Frequently used <a href="drc.html#ext">engraving</a> of the church that sat in the middle of the intersection of State Street and Broadway until it was removed in 1806. It is most often remembered by the term "The <a href="books.html#alexander">First Church</a>" in Albany. Virtually all of the known renderings of this building are based on this image of unknown origins.</p></blockquote>

      <p><a name=*></a>While it may well have been the "<a href="churches.html">first</a> and certainly the foremost congregation in the city," it was 
        not the first church building as at least two predecessors were Reformed houses of worship in Albany prior to 1715.</p>
