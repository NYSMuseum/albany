          <P><img src="images/jpg/a300logo.jpg" width=200, border=1, align=right alt="logo of the city of Albany Tricentennial"> 
            <b>I</b>n 1986, Albany staged a year-long celebration commemorating 
            the 300th anniversary of its <a href="charter.html">chartering</a> 
            as a city. That program was known widely as "The Tricentennial" and/or "A-300."</p>
<p>A large "Tricentennial Commission" was named by city officials and 
            a range of events and activities were presented throughout the year. 
            These included galas, parades, contests, and "good-time" events that 
            seemed to take their cue from the frequently played if not official 
            Tricentennial <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx_3ral3e08">song</a> - "Let's Have a Party Albany!" Sale items ranging 
            from diamonds to doughnuts were marketed as "Tricentennial souvenirs!"</P>
          <P>The Tricentennial Commission did sponsor a number of educational 
            programs - some of which had a long-term effect on the consciousness 
            of the community. Although still very much in its formative stages, 
            the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> was asked to participate 
            in the planning and presentation of community-based, history-related 
            programs.</p>
          <p>The project played a central role in an exhibition of the 300-year-old 
            charter document as the centerpiece of a widely circulated exhibit 
            called "Government by the People." Also featured in that exhibition 
            were four <a href="#drawings">original drawings</a> by historical 
            artist <A href="http://www.lftantillo.com">Len Tantillo</a>. A social 
            history of the chartering, published also as <a href="pub.html#gbp"><i>Government 
            by the People</i></a>, was written by <a href="bios/staff/sbbio.html">Stefan 
            Bielinski</a>. During the spring term of 1986, Bielinski taught a 
            graduate seminar on Albany and its chartering at Russell Sage College. 
            A public lecture series on the chartering accompanied the course and 
            became a video program that aired widely on government access television 
            in the years that followed. The Commission also published a printed 
            version of the original charter document. It too was widely distributed.</P>

<p>In retrospect, the Albany Tricentennial was responsible for the emergence 
            of the <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> as a public history program 
            - perhaps prematurely, but certainly connecting an originally <a href="pub.html">one-dimensional</a> 
            research project to a range of interested audiences and communities 
            for all time!
			
<p>Since the 1980s, the Project has presented a wide range of more traditional community-based history <a href="guide/intro.html#pgm">programs</a> that have addressed all of our target <a href="guide/intro.html#aud">audiences</a>. However, over the past decade or so, <i>The People of Colonial Albany Live Here <a href="index.html">Website</a></i> has emerged and continues to grow and evolve toward the ultimate end of serving all of our intended programming needs. Please check in on our <a href="newfeatures.html">progress</a> at any time.</p>

          <p><a name="drawings"></a>These <b>drawings</b> were the result of Len 
            Tantillo's ability to transform project research in the form of conversations 
            with staff into pen-and-ink expositions depicting the first <a href="commoncouncil.html">common 
            council meeting</a>, an <a href="earlycity.html">overview diagram</a> 
            of the city in 1686, a <a href="loc/court.html">street scene</a> near 
            city hall, and the <a href="furtrade.html">fur trade</a> - Albany's 
            original reason for existence. These visual resources were used in 
            the Tricentennial Programs noted above and in virtually many of the 
            programs produced by the CAP since then.
