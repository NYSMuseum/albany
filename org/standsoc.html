      <p><a href="#source">By</a> the end of the <a href="../7yw.html">S</a>even 
        Years War, a small yet diverse community of <a href="../bios/irish.html">Scottish</a> 
        ancestry &eacute;migr&eacute;s had settled in Albany. 
      <p> Although present in some numbers (Livingston, Glen, Sanders) since the 
        city's earliest days, many were recent arrivals and less likely to support 
        the community-based initiatives that led to the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">American 
        Revolution</a>. Predominately <a href="../presbyterian.html">Presbyterians</a>, 
        their meeting house and other distinguishing cultural markers would be 
        much less visible during the wartime years. During the late 1770s, a number 
        of prominent Albany Scots were <a href="../friends.html">called out</a> 
        as enemies of liberty although they appear to have been more interested 
        in trade than in turmoil. A prime example of this situation was Albany 
        native <a href="../bios/s/jostevenson2244.html">John Stevenson</a>, the 
        son of a colonial city treasurer who had married an Albany woman of <a href="../nnd.html">N</a>ew 
        Netherland ancestry. 
      <p>With the coming of <a href="../or/or-eb.html">peace</a>, however, Albany's 
        Scots (defined here as Calvinists rather than Catholics) were able to 
        move forward. During the 1780s and afterward, a steady stream of Scottish 
        ancestry <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> settled in Albany where 
        they sought to set down roots. 
      <p>By the early <a href="../census1800.html">1800</a>s, Albany's Scots had 
        become a <a href="#visible">visible</a> part of the community landscape. 
        In 1802, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GpUPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22andrew+brown%22&source=bl&ots=EJhZb6y1zY&sig=2VqgX6TuzYlsqll5iGbNsZmVfsc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihpdXIpInMAhXDPD4KHT41CKoQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20brown%22&f=false">eighteen</a> 
        Scottish ancestry Albany men formed the "United Irish and Scotch Benevolent 
        Society" with <a href="../bios/b/anbrown7448.html">Andrew Brown</a>, a 
        native of Scotland, as its first president. 
      <p>In January <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GpUPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22andrew+brown%22&source=bl&ots=EJhZb6y1zY&sig=2VqgX6TuzYlsqll5iGbNsZmVfsc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihpdXIpInMAhXDPD4KHT41CKoQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20brown%22&f=false">1803</a>, 
        merchant entrepreneur <a href="../bios/c/jacaldwell7509.html">James Caldwell</a> 
        was elected President. On October 3, what was called a "special meeting" 
        marked the first of what appear to be more regular gatherings that detailed 
        the organization's aims and operations. 
      <p>The society's <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22andrew's+society%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=st%20andrew's%20society&f=false">officers</a> 
        were listed in the annual <a href="../sources.html#ad">City Directory</a> 
        beginning with the first edition in <a href="#visible">1813</a>, 
      <p>In 1903, a centennial publication recounted the Society's first century 
        of operations. It also provides (often detailed and interpretive) <a href="">sketches</a> 
        of its leaders. The <a href="http://www.standrewssocietyalbany.org/">St. 
        Andrew's Society of the City of Albany</a> located at <a href="http://www.standrewssocietyalbany.org/rooms/">150 
        Washington Avenue</a> continues that legacy today. Its substantial website 
        answers many questions about one of Albany's premier historical organizations.

        At the same time, we recognize that the Mcs and Macs were not the only

        the community.
