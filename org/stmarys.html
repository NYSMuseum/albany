<p><a href="#sources">St. Mary's</a> Roman Catholic church was incorporated by the State legislature in October 1796 and began operations the following year - making it the second oldest parish in New York State. St. Mary's was the fifth or sixth <a href="../churches.html">church</a> to open in the city of Albany.</p>

<p><b>C</b>atholics had been part of the Albany population since the early days of the community. They were chiefly of <a href="../bios/huguenot.html">French</a>, <a href="../bios/ger.html">German</a>, and <a href="../bios/irish.html">Irish</a> ancestries. In <a href="../census1697.html">1697</a>, the first comprehensive census of city householders specified <a href="../census1697.html#@">some</a> ethnicity information. Some of those not so tagged were of English or German origins - some of whom came to America as Catholics. <a href="../bios/vz/jojavzandt291.html">Joseph Janse</a> (<a href="../bios/vz/vzandt.html">Van Zandt</a>) was <a href="../census1697.html#043">id</a>entified as a Spaniard. 

<p>In <a href="../lists/list1699.html">1699</a>, an "Albany" list of those who swore an <a href="../lists/list1699.html#oath">oath</a> of allegiance to the Protestant king of England noted that <a href="../bios/p/frpruyn.html">Frans Pruyn</a> and "Villeroy" (<a href="../bios/d/pdegarmo947.html">Pierre De Garmo</a>) were "Papists" and were excused from swearing in lieu of otherwise <a href="../lists/list1699.html#oath">attesting</a> to their loyalty to William & Mary. </p>

<p>For most of the eighteenth century, Albany's Catholics found basic spiritual services under the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However,they do not seem to have become members. Probably because of worship similarities and language, Catholics had gravitated to <a href="../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> and to the <a href="../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. 

<p><a href="#image"><img src="../images/jpg/bldg/stmarys1797.jpg" align=right width=300 height=266 border=2 alt="Depiction of St. Mary's Catholic Church in 1797"></a>In 1796, the first trustees of St. Mary's were:  <a href="../bios/b/thbarry1821.html">Thomas Barry</a>, <a href="../bios/l/lolecout.html">Louis Le Couteulx</a>, Daniel McEvers, Terrence O'Donnell, Jeremiah Driscoil, <a href="../bios/b/mibegley.html">Michael Bagley</a>, <a href="../bios/r/jarob1163.html">James Robichaux</a> (the first public meeting was held at his house), William Donovan, and Philip Farrell. The cornerstone of the first church building was laid in September 1797. Long time resident Thomas Barry appears to have led the drive for funding church construction as well.  

<p>Catholic priests and missionaries had visited Albany since Father <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Jogues">Isaac Jogues</a> was ransomed by Dutch traders and brought to <a href="../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> in 1642 or 1643. Visiting Catholics of note included Marylanders <a href="../doc/carroll1776.html">Charles and John Carroll</a> in 1776, Fr. <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/huet_de_la_valiniere_pierre_5E.html">Pierre de Valiniere</a> (1792) of Canada, and others.

<p><a href="../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that services were held in private homes at least until after the American Revolution. New England born and recent convert <a href="http://www.catholichistory.net/People/JohnThayer.htm">Rev. John Thayer</a> appears to have been the first "missionary rector" and served while the church was being built in 1798. Fr. <a href="#mob">Matthew O'Brien</a> succeeded him and served as pastor until 1800.

<p>In November 1799, the "trustees and principal members" signed a <a href="#test">testimonial</a> praising O'Brien's tenure and expressing concern about the future of the parish.

<p>By 1820, St. Mary's counted over 300 parishioners (in a booming city of <a href="../population.html">12,600</a> residents)

<p>Initially, members of the Catholic church were <a href="../dead.html">buried</a> in the Washington Park Cemetery. Following the Civil War, the stones were moved - mostly to <a href="../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>. Also located in Menands, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Agnes_Cemetery">St. Agnes Cemetery</a> is the historic resting place of record  for Albany's Catholics.

<p><b>Matthew O'Brien</b>: "Rev. Dr. Matthew O'Brien, O. P., a native of Ireland, was born in 1756, came to America and was stationed at Albany, N. Y., from 1798 to 1800. In 1803 he was appointed to St. Peter's, New York city, and remained here until 1807. He was later stationed in Philadelphia, and died in Baltimore, 1816. He was a brother of Rev. William O'Brien, who was pastor of St. Peter's from Nov. 1787 to 1807. Matthew died in Baltimore, Oct. 15, 1816."

<p><b>1799 Testimonial</b> regarding Father O'Brien:
          <blockquote>
            <p>We, the trustees, and principal members of the congregation of 
              the church in Albany, beg leave to testify with due obedience, and 
              of our own free will and accord: first, that the zeal and exertions 
              of our late pastor, Rev. Doctor Matthew O'Brien, demand our merited 
              praises. And that his ability, fervor and assiduity in preaching 
              the word of God, has been by us uniformly felt and generally admitted. 
              His protecting our spiritual interests has been unremitting and 
              surely meritorious in every respect. Third, that his conduct has 
              appeared to us on every occasion, charitable, disinterested, candid, 
              and free from censure. Fourth, that we contemplate his departure 
              from amongst us with sincere and true concern. In confirmation of 
              which we have affixed hereto the seal of our church. <br>
              Albany, November 10, 1799.

            Document entitled "St. Mary's Church. 1797. : The first Catholic Church 
            in Albany" and thought to have been issued between 1886 and 1900. 
            The repository description reads: "Image of an elevated street view 
            of the two-story St. Mary's Church in Albany, New York, depicted in 
            the late 18th century, on a street corner with surrounding buildings, 
            two women walking on the sidewalk, and a fort on the hill in the distance. 
            Notes = Probable date based on printer history. "Pinkster Hill."--text, 
            bottom left margin. "The Donaldson Litho. Co. Cin O." "From Original 
            Painting in Possession of Col. Thos. Barry New York." 
          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; More information from an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay">eBay, inc.</A> listing encountered 
            <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/St-Marys-Church-1797-The-First-Catholic-Church-In-Albany-NY-Lithograph-/370749317737">online</a> 
            in September 2016: "This piece measures 23 1/2" wide and 19 1/2" high. 
            It reads "Pinkster Hill St. Mary's Church 1797 The First Catholic 
            Church in Albany From Original Painting in possession of Col. Thos. 
            Barry New York". It also reads "The Donaldson Litho Co. Cin O.". The 
            condition of this piece is very good. The colors of the print are 
            very good. The frame has lost a bit of the applied molding at a few 
            spots. I have photographed the worst for you to see." <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We have <a href="../res/fairuse.html">appropriated</a> this most attractive version of an often-encountered locally and in  print (and somewhat fanciful - consider the fort ruins) engraving/lithograph of a watercolor of unknown origins.

<p><a name=cornerstone></a><b>Cornerstone</b>: Detail of the cornerstone said to have been in 1797. Modern photograph from an unknown source. Includes engravings of the names of prominent parishioners - trustees Thomas Barry and Louis Le Coulteux and "Master Builder" <a href="../bios/q/emquinn.html">E. C. Quinn</a>.
