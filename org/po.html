<p>The permanent <a href="#sources">Post Office</a> in Albany seems to date to the 1770s. Prior to that, letters and other "mail" seems to have been carried by individuals on horseback over the <a href="http://users.bestweb.net/~judynoel/ors/orshist.htm">Albany Post Road</a> or by boat to and from New York and from Albany to its hinterland and beyond. The <a href="../sources.html#jp">published papers</a> of <a href="../bios/j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a> are full of references to the movement of mail by individuals! </p>

            <p>In 1730, the provincial postmaster advertised for someone to carry 
              the mail between New York and Albany. Based in his Albany home, 
              merchant <a href="../bios/vs/hvschaack.html">Henry Van Schaack</a> 
              served as postmaster from 1757 to 1771. By that time, he had been 
              superseded by newcomer <a href="../bios/m/jmonier.html">John Monier</a>, 
              who served until the outbreak of war in 1775. Centrally located 
              innkeeper <a href="../bios/c/ricartwright6508.html">Richard Cartwright</a> 
              served as deputy postmaster for much of that time.</p>

<p>In 1775, the Continental Congress appointed Benjamin Frankilin as the first American postmaster. <a href="../bios/y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> appears to have been Albany's first postmaster - serving under the auspices of the United States during the 1780s if not before! </p>

<p>By 1795, the Post Office was located on Market Street home and then in the back room of the home of <a href="../bios/m/wilman.html">Dr. Mancius</a>. Following his father's death in 1808, <a href="../bios/m/jacman.html">Jacob Mancius</a> succeeded in the post office in the house on the corner of State and Broadway.  That building was torn down in 1861.</p>

<p>Printers (for example, <a href="../bios/s/sosouthwick.html">Solomon Southwick</a>) often were named postmaster.

<p>Letter carrier <a href="../bios/w/wbwinne.html">William B. Winne</a> was the known as the "three penny post" and has been made famous in an early twentieth century silhouette.</P>

<p>In 1816, the Post Office address was 353 North Market Street. Albany patrician <a href="../bios/vr/solvr5113.html">Solomon Van Rensselaer</a> served as postmaster in Albany from 1822 to 1839 and again from 1841-43.</p>


<p>Trains had taken over the mail service by 1840. Glen Curtiss made the first mail flight from an airstrip on Castle Island to New York in May 1910.</p>
