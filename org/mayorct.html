<p>The Albany <a href="#source">Mayor's Court</a> was established following the granting of the <a href="../charter.html">city charter</a> of 1686. It was the logical successor to the municipal/town (local) <a href="../sources.html#cma">court</a> put into place by the English after 1664. These, in turn, appear to have been based on the <a href="../sources.html#cmb">Court</a> of <a href="../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> - which adjudicated local matters during the last decade of the <a href="../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> period.
<p>During the long eighteenth century, a range of legal matters appeared to be considered by the "Mayor's Court." It appears that, the justices were the mayor and city council. References to Mayor's Court considerations are found throughout the printed <a href="../guide/histres.html#cr">City Records</a>. "Mayor's Court" may have been a functional name for the "Court of Common Pleas."

<p>As more pertainent information is encountered during the course of our work it <a href="../inprog.html">will be added</a> to this exposition.

<p>Actual, distinct records of the Mayor's Court have been <a href="../guide/histres.html#mayor's">preserved</a> for the years 1761 to 1800.</p>

<p>A number of monthly jury lists covering <a href="../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a> have been preserved in the papers of Sheriff <a href="../bios/g/jogiven.html">John Given</a>.
