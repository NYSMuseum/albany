      <font size=+1> The middle part of the early Albany <a href="econ/comec.html">community 
      economy</a> included the artisans, craftsmen, and tradesmen who used forest, 
      metal, fabric, and animal materials to build and make most of the things 
      the people of colonial Albany used in their daily lives. 
      <p><a href="#diderot"><img SRC="images/jpg/saddlers.jpg" ALT="Eighteenth-cenutury Saddler's shop" BORDER=1  width=200 align=right vspace=4 hspace=4></a>These were Albany's <a href="#wood">woodworkers</a>, <a href="#metal">smiths</a>, <a href="#hemp">tailors</a>, and <a href="#leather">leatherworkers</a>.
Because most made goods were used and reused and few things were throw
away, these producers also spent much of their work time repairing, augmenting,
and adapting existing domestic and imported items. Albany's producers,
its makers and fixers, accounted for the largest part of the community
economy until the coming of the Industrial Revolution.</font>

          


<p><font size=+1> Albany's production economy first served the settlers within the community and its agricultural <a href="albanycounty.html">hinterland</a>. But from its earliest days, Albany was a place where outsiders came to obtain goods and supplies and to have their broken tools and implements repaired. This tradition began during the New Netherland era when the community's principal activity involved <a href="furtrade.html">trading for furs</a> with Native Americans who came to Albany and its antecedents, <a href="loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> and <a href="beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. A few Albany fur traders were able to offer imported tools, trinkets, textiles, and tasty morsels. These intricate, colorful, and exotic items were most preferred by the Indians.

<p><a name=tinker>But most Albany people had little access to imported items and instead baked, brewed, hammered, and sewed foodstuffs, implements, clothing, and leather items for use in the Indian
trade. They also repaired and customized the tools, weapons, and other trade items that invariably were broken by their unknowing new owners. Albany's enduring identity as a repair center can be traced to the seventeenth-century fur trade, a by-product of which was an enclave of fixers or tinkerers which continued to grow into the twentieth century. These handiwork initiatives made it possible for one-time tenants and colonists to become successful commercial entrepreneurs. The Indian fur trade was responsible for the success of the commercial community that became Albany in 1664 and provided the basis for the wealth of most New Netherland-era families.</p>

<p>As time passed, a few Albany traders evolved into businessmen - buying and selling goods, commodities, and services. More frequently, however, after the passing of the
fur trade, onetime traders began to rely more on their production and repair
skills. By the early 1700s, a substantial production community had
become a prominent feature of Albany society. These craftspeople
utilized forest and animal products, metals, and fabrics, whether locally
gathered and extracted or imported from Europe, to fashion finished items
for sale to their city neighbors and to a growing regional market.
Their products were of variable quality. Some Albany producers came
to the community with a learned skill. Some were the sons of or had
observed craftsmen at work in Europe and elsewhere in America. Others
sought to duplicate imported items for sale. By the middle of the eighteenth
century, Albany people were engaged in dozens of production activities
- turning out market items with varying degrees of distinction and success.</font>
<p><font size=+1> Because production activities
involved virtually every early Albany family, the story of the community's
tradesmen and tinkerers is a major theme in the city's history. This
section provides access to the stories of hundreds of early Albany working
people. In addition, the Colonial Albany Project
has published <a href="pub.html#articles">several articles on the early Albany workforce</a>.

We find them particularly appropriate for early Albany even though they often depict several tradesmen working together - which was only beginning to happen in early Albany!</p>
