    <P><A name=wa></a><B>WA</B> &nbsp; - &nbsp; The manuscript that became <b><i>An Abridgment 
      of the Indian Affairs Contained in Four Folio Volumes, Transacted in the 
      Colony of New York, from the year 1678 to the year 1751,</i></b> was compiled 
      by <a href="bios/w/pwraxall.html">Peter Wraxall</a> in 1754. 

<br><dd><font size=-1>The collection 
      of records Wraxall inherited was not comprehensive but he provided a fairly 
      meticulous summary of the collection. Apparently, Wraxall translated some 
      records from Dutch to English. The "abridgment" manuscript passed through 
      several hands (see pp. xcv-vi) and was purchased by the New York State Library 
      in 1854. A copy of the manuscript was made in 1904. That manuscript was 
      edited and presented with an extensive introduction by Charles H. Mc Ilwain. 
      The work was published under the abovementioned title as volume 21 of the 
      "Harvard Historical Studies" series by Harvard University Press in 1915. 
      Wraxall's manuscript abridgments were destroyed in the State Capitol fire 
      of 1911.</font size></dd>
