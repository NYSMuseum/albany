<br>
<p>The image adapted and reproduced below dates from the earliest <a href="../new2000.html#4">days</a> of the <a href="../welcome.html"><i>People of Colonial Albany Live Here Website</i></a>. At that time, it was presented to help place the <a href="../earlycity.html">city</a> of <a href="../criteria.html">A</a>lbany in a regional context during the mid-eighteenth century. The image's actual history is is <a href="../bios/qqqq.html">not</a> so easily traced. 		  
		  
<p> <font size =+1>T</font size>he detail shown below probably is from an engraving of a much larger <a href="#map">map</a> of the northern colonies made 
          by Dr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mitchell_(geographer)">John Mitchell</a>, a Virginia-born, Scottish-educated physician who was well-connected in British aristocratic circles. Mitchell made at least two manuscript maps for the Earl of Halifax. One later version was engraved by British cartographer and engraver <a href="#Kitchin">Thomas Kitchin</a>. The engraving was published (printed and issued) by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Millar">Andrew Millar</a> in April 1755.    This statement represents the extent of our <a href="../inprog.html">knowledge</a> of the history of this <a href="../res/fairuse.html">resource</a>.  

<p>Although Mitchell was reknowned as an illustrator of the North American landscape, the work shown here is mostly called "The <a href="../res/sp.html">K</a>itchen Map." It conveys a sense of the huge geographical dimensions of <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany 
          County</a> at its largest - we say for convenience, from New England (or more exactly the west bank of the Connecticut River) 
          to the Indian Country and from Kingston to Canada! At the same time, it helps visualize the fact that old Albany County was in the process of being "tamed and settled" by European and African-ancestry colonists who were becoming Americans. Consider the number of settlements shown on this resource. <a href="../albanycounty.html#pop">Population statistics</a> for the county further document that growth.
		   
<p>However, unlike most illustrations produced by Europeans and by the British army in particular, this map shows virtually all of the actual settlements in the region and also labels some of the territories and Native American settlements that had already existed on the landscape area shown in this detail. Because Albany was central to and in the center of this large settlement area, we have included a number of regional <a href="../pcalhindex.html#map">maps</a> on this website. </p>

<p>The area shown points out the principal settlements, waterways, roads, and also pertainent natural features such as "The Bar" - a sandbar in the Hudson that tested the skill of eighteenth century <a href="../art/art-rpea.html">Hudson River navigators</a>.
		  
<p>This map is one of a number of historical visualizations from that time made mostly by cartographers and engineers affiliated with the British army. The <a href="johnsonmap.html">map</a> made in 1771 by Guy Johnson had different purposes as did the engraving attributed to Claude Joseph Sauthier of a few years later. The so-called Sauthier map presented on this website <a href="../im/imsauthier.html">invites</a> further exploration.</p>

<p><a name=map></a><b>Detail</b> from a work entitled "A Map of the Eastern Part of the Province of New York; with Part of New Jersey. &c." It was 
          first printed in the <i>London Magazine</i> in September 1756. We have 
          digitized the image from an unattributed print copy in <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> <a href="../grapharch.html">Graphics 
          Archive</a>. Versions of this engraving have been printed in many books. The most likely "original" sources are probably among the following:
