            <P><B>S</B>tate Surveyor-General and Albany resident <A href="../bios/d/sdewitt.html">Simeon 
              De Witt</A> made a number of maps for the Albany corporation during 
              the early 1790s. The first of these is preserved in the collection 
              of the <A href="http://www.albanycounty.com/achor">Albany County 
              Hall of Records</A>. The original is faded, only faintly readable, 
              and not suitable for presentation. The versions most often seen 
              are reprints of engravings made in 1794 and after. Two of these 
              engravings are of particular value in understanding the layout and 
              development of the post-Revolutionary city.</P>
            <P>Presented directly below is a reprint of an engraving of a map 
              we believe was made by De Witt about 1790. It was his base (or basic) 
              city map. It seems to represent Albany's existing features at that 
              time - depicting functional streets, natural features, public buildings, 
              and other landmarks. With the maps made by Wolfgang <a href="../im/imroemer.html">Roemer</a> 
              and <A href="../lastdays.html">Robert Yates</A>, it is of inestimable 
              value.</P>

            <P>A "few" years later, De Witt produced another version of his city 
              map. It was based on his earlier cartography, chronicled some of 
              the changes (particularly along the waterfront) in the Albany landscape 
              since his earlier work, marked political subdivisions (<A href="../wards.html">wards</A>), 
              and included blocks of speculative streets that had not yet been 
              laid out. The city today is based on this street plan. The image 
              presented below is a copy of an engraved version of that map.</P>

            <P>Although they depict the city at the end of its formative period, 
              these historical icons have been widely used in virtually every 
              exposition on the history of early Albany.</P>

            <P><A name=1790></a>The first likeness of the <B>De Witt map of 1790</B> 
              is taken from an engraving by W. H. Pease as it appeared in <a href="../bios/staff/ajweise.html">Arthur 
              J. Weise</a>, <I>The History of the City of Albany, New York</I> 
              (Albany, 1884). At this point, we have not a manuscript version 
              of this basic city map in any publication.</P>
            <P><A name=1794></a>The representation shown directly above is taken 
              from an engraving made by Albany silversmith <a href="../bios/h/ishutton.html">Isaac 
              Hutton</a> in <B>1794</B>. Entitled "Plan of the City of Albany 
              Surveyed by Simeon De Witt," it is best preserved locally in the 
              collections of the <A href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany 
              Institute of History and Art</A>. Inexpensive offprint copies were 
              produced in 1968 by "Historic Urban Plans" of Ithaca, New York and 
              are widely available today in the Albany area.       </FONT size>
