<p><font face="arial"><font size =+1>T</font size>he oldest known historical visualization of the city of Albany seems have come from a faded sketch/drawing 
            that was found among the New York <a href="#lp">Land Papers</a> 
            and is now in the collection of the <a href="http://unix6.nysed.gov/">New 
            York State Archives</a>. Written on the parchment manuscript is the 
            after-the-fact notation "French Map 1676." No other information was associated with the document.

<p>The image shown here is a retouched but relatively faithful engraving 
              of that sketch. Produced during the middle of the nineteenth century, 
              the engraving has appeared in a number of publications including 
              the <a href="../sources.html#ht"><i>Bicentennial History of the 
              City of Albany</i></a>, published in 1886 and the source of this image. However, it seems to be derivative of an essay printed  in volume 4 of the <a href="http://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/200/mode/2up"><i>Annals of Albany</i></a>. The accompanying narrative <a href="#aa">appears below</a>.
			  
<p>The easternmost road running parallel to the river became <a href="../streets.html#market">Market</a> 
              and Court Streets. "<a href="../streets.html">Joncaer</a>" became 
              State Street. "Rom" became <a href="../streets.html#maiden">Maiden               Lane</a>.</p>
 
            <p>Historians have been speculating about the source and authenticity 
              of this relic for more than a hundred years. We believe it to be 
              useful for the history of Albany because it conforms roughly to 
              subsequent cartography and thus provides one of the earliest visual 
              links to the early Albany past.</p>
            <p>The <a href="mailto:sbielins@mail.nysed.gov"><i>Colonial Albany 
              Project</i></a> actively seeks more information about this important 
              resource!</p>

<p><a name="lp"></a><font size=-1><b>Land Papers</b>: The manuscript map is in volume 1 of the "Land Papers" as described on page 6 of the <i><a href="../sources.html#clp">Calendar of . . . Land Papers, 1643-1803</a></i> (Albany, 1864). The sketch originally was undated but was placed between two items dated October 20, 1674 and March 1, 1675.

<p><a name=aa></a>The diagram on the opposite page is a facsimile 
              of the oldest plan of the city that has yet been discovered. It 
              is reduced from the original manuscript in the office of the Secretary 
              of State, preserved by Dr. O'Callaghan, in the series marked Land 
              Papers, I, 58. It seems to embrace that part of the city now bounded 
              by the river on the east, Beaver street on the south, Pearl street 
              on the west, and Steuben street on the north. But two streets are 
              denominated on the map, Joncaer straet, now State; and Rom straet, 
              now Maiden lane. Broadway is represented by parallel lines. The 
              earliest title that we know for it, was Handelaer straet, as seen 
              on a map made twenty years later. (See Annals III, 39.) The walls, 
              it will be seen, are pierced for six gates (poerts). The guard house 
              seems to have occupied the old elm tree corner, and Pearl street 
              was eighty feet wide, now eighty-four. The bridge (Jbrug) crossed 
              the Rutten kill just north of the foot of Beaver street. The dwellings 
              (huysen) were thus confined within a narrow compass, and surrounded 
              by a line of upright posts, of which pine seems to have been the 
              customary material, thirteen feet long and one foot in diameter. 
              The preservation of this wooden wall was expensive and vexatious 
              to an extraordinary degree, as the records bear witness. Mandates 
              wenth forth periodically to compel delinquent burghers to produce 
              and " sett their quotaes"; " and even forlorn widows were sternly 
              commanded by the burgomasters and schepens, in grim conclave at 
              the Citty hall, to " ride their stockadoes; " in default whereof 
              the schout fiscaal was diected to strain 18d for each deficient 
              stockadoe ! </p>
