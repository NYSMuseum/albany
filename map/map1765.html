<FONT face=arial><p><b>T</b>his is a <a href="#print">print of an engraving of a map</a> of Albany probably made by a British army engineer showing the settlement/city following the end of the <a href="../7yw.html">Fr</a>ench and Indian Wars. It is dated "1765" - the year it was <a href="#print">published</a> in London as part of a <a href="http://www.masshist.org/maps/PlansandForts/PlansAndFortsIndex.htm">collection</a> of military maps of places in New York and beyond. This image presents an intriguing yet puzzling perspective on the Albany landscape. It is dominated by a proposed (and never built) stockade that would box in the community on three sides. It shows terrain and landmarks of strategic value. Within a year or so, the stockade and most other military features were being dismantled as they no longer were in use. This was the last of a <a href="../pcalhindex.html#map">number</a> of maps made by agents of the British army.

<p>The map also shows the "Remains of an Old Fort" (<a href="../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>) in the lower left hand corner; a knoll within the stockade 
            above today's South Pearl Street we believe is the legendary "<a href="../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows 
            Hill</a>"; the first visualization of a dock extending out from today's 
            Exchange Street (Mark Lane); a number of unidentified military structures; 
            and a greatly expanded (yet labeled as "proposed") stockade.</p>

<p>This piece of cartography presents an interesting comparative to the city of just five years later as shown in a <a href="../lastdays.html">Albany map</a> drawn by Albany resident <a href="../bios/y/ryates.html">Robert Yates</a>.

            Archive</a> of the <a href="../whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social 
            History Project</i></a>. It most likely was made from <i>A Set of Plans and Forts in America - reduced from Actual Survey</i> by Mary Ann Roque, "Topographer to the Duke of Gloucester,"  and first published in London in 1765. That work can be found in a number of prominent <a href="http://www.masshist.org/maps/PlansandForts/intro.htm">repositories</a>. A beautifully digitized version of that work appears <a href="http://www.masshist.org/maps/PlansandForts/PlansAndFortsp02.htm">online</a>. I first saw and read about it in Munsell's <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/344/mode/2up"><i>Annals of Albany</i></a>. 

</font size><dd><font size=-1>Our offering is a low resolution adaptation of a very cheap print that I picked up years ago at a now defunct local bookshop for I recall five dollars.
