<p><b>A</b> likeness of this "manuscript sketch" appeared in <i><a href="http://www.archive.org/details/lifelettersofsim00balduoft">The Life and Letters of Simeon Baldwin</a></i>, by Simeon E. Baldwin - published in 1919. The sketch appears following p.177 as part of a long chapter (pp. 86-180) entitled "<a href="../doc/membal.html">Year as a Schoolmaster in Albany</a>." 

<p>Baldwin located points of interest to him during his short stay in the city. Surveyor and city father <a href="../bios/y/ryates.html">Robert Yates</a> has provided an earlier (but "linked") <a href="../im/im1770.html">perspective</a> on the city. State Surveyor General <a href="../bios/d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a> presented a more fully <a href="../im/im1794.html">articulated version</a> of Albany during the early 1790s.

<p>We recognize that the image shown in not of the best quality. It was scanned from the book and <a href="../inprog.html">needs</a> to be enhanced.
