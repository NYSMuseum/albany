<p><font size=+1> Whoever said a picture is worth
a thousand (or ten thousand) words never was more correct than when describing
the value of visuals in creating images of life in the past. Because
of movie and television screens, we have become a visual society and
make decisions more on what we see in the media than on what we have read.
In other words, we are different from our forebears and fundamentally
different from the people of colonial Albany whose world view was confined
to what they could see with their own eyes or what if anything they could
read.

<p> Today, most people are literate and everyone has access to a volume and array of printed information that would astound even the most forwrd thinking eighteenth-century person.
However, most people make judgments quickly and few of us have the patience
to read through and absorb even the shortest passages. While the
written word remains a favorite of the modern historian's programming tool
chest, effective presentations today involve pictures, portraits, and maps,
and the most effective and inspiring programming is visually based.

<p>Gaining a visual perspective on the people of colonial Albany and their world has been an enlightening and frustrating experience for the community historians at the <i><a href="whoarewe.html">Colonial Albany Social History Project</a></i>. Basic to our overall program is the need to visualize the pre-industrial community and to appreciate
the look and feel of everyday life. Over the past decade, project
research has addressed these issues. At this point, we have identified
and captured on film most of the known visual representations of early
Albany and its people. Many of these historical treasures are more
than 200 years old and are held in historical museums such as the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany
Institute of History and Art</a>, the <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov">New
York State Museum</a>, and <a href="http://www.pojonews.com/enjoy/stories/0924964.htm">Schuyler
Mansion State Historic Site</a>. Other materials are less centrally
held in public repositories (including the <A HREF="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/">New York State Library</a> and <a href="http://www.sara.nysed.gov/">State
Archives</a>), in private collections, and on a more individual basis.
At the same time, we believe that much more material has survived and remains
to be re-discovered.

<p> Our search of the traditional historical record and of the most important cultural repositories has yielded
material that has become a "Graphics Archive" of several thousand images.
These include portraits, paintings, drawings, maps, documents, slides of
three-dimensional objects in museum and private collections, and a growing
collection of "historical art." This last group of 19th and 20th
century materials includes two and three-dimensional materials - paintings
and drawings, modern photographs, images of reproduction artifacts and
revival architecture, and a video library of useful tapes.

<p><a href="victorian.html#eights">James Eights</a> was Albany's first great historical artist. He painted the community
he remembered while growing up in Albany during the early nineteenth-century.
Interpreted often, reproduced liberally, and presented in most of the traditional
histories of the city, his mid-nineteenth century recreations of early
Albany scenes have inspired all students of early Albany.

<p> Until recently, virtually all of the creditable historical artwork focused on early Albany has been derivative of the work of James Eights. During the 1980s, a new artist appeared
on the historical horizon unveiling a set of paintings and drawings that were very different from the Eights streetscapes and building portraits.

<p><a name="tantillo"></a>Trained as an architect, <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com">Leonard F. Tantillo</a> sought to interpret important historical themes by visualizing new and important elements of the early Albany story. The fact that each of his paintings also was based on substantial historical research gave Tantillo's historical art a dimension not much utilized in the past.<p><font size=+1> After completing a panoramic view of the Albany Basin as it 
  might have appeared just after the Civil War and a startling painting of <a href="loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> in 1635, he first collaborated with the <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> 
  in 1985 on a project to produce an exhibit and book commemorating the <a href="tricentennial.html">300th 
  anniversary</a> of Albany's city charter. Based on maps, property records, consultation 
  with us and many others, and much personal research, Len produced a set of four 
  pen-and-ink drawings of Albany in 1686. Three scenes commemorating the first 
  meeting of the <a href="commoncouncil.html">Albany Common Council</a>, the <a href="furtrade.html">fur 
  trade</a>, city life on <a href="loc/court.html">Court Street</a>, and a detailed 
  <a href="images/jpg/map.jpg">birds-eye diagram</a> of how the city looked at 
  the time of its chartering have become the most useful and popular representations 
  of early Albany life.</font> 
<p><font size=+1> Working in concert with <i>Colonial
Albany Project</i> staff and with a larger network of historians and other
advisors, Tantillo has created more than a dozen historical pieces that
have breathed life into historical programs and presentations in Albany
and beyond. Also, prints of these handsome paintings are widely found
in homes, offices, and public buildings - inspiring images of city life
in the past. These works have run the chronological gamut from a
representation of the trading house on <a href="na/castle.html">Castle Island</a> in 1615 to the Hudson
River Day Line Ticket Office in the early 1900s. In 1996, the Art
Gallery and Museum at the State University at Albany opened an exhibition
of Tantillo's work entitled <a href="http://www.albany.edu/museum/wwwmuseum/tantillo/main.html">Visions
of New York State: The Historical Paintings of L.F. Tantillo</a>.
Because the artist paints more to convey a sense of the past rather than
for "art for art's sake," this exhibition has been controversial and has
inspired some discussion in regional arts circles over its merits and value.
At the same time, <i>Visions of New York State </i>was the most popular
exhibition in the history of the University Art Gallery.</font>
<p><font size=+1> With an unparalleled ability
to make diverse people appreciate and understand that "history happened
here", we believe that <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/shop/len-tantillo-biography/info_1.html">Len Tantillo</a> is the most effective interpreter
of the city's past. His work has a profound effect on the overall
progress of the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i>. His
creations and the questions he and others have raised regarding them have
led us to consider the community's past in much more than grammatical terms.
As he continues to create new images that move in on the community and
the lives of its people, we have been blessed with a powerful programming
tool.</font></p><font size=+1>
