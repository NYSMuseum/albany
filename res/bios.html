<p><font size=-1><blockquote><b>T</b>he <b>most basic element</b> of our <a href="../welcome.html">website exposition</a> on the people of colonial Albany and their world is a 
<a href="#bio"><b>biographical presentation</b></a> on the <a href="../criteria.html">life of a person</a> who lived in the city of Albany more than two hundred years ago! Some of these people were <a href="../bios/s/pischuyler61.html">lifelong residents</a>; others lived in the city for <a href="../bios/h/wmhogan4396.html">substantial parts</a> of their lives; <a href="../bios/y/thyoung.html">others</a> were just passing through. By the end of 2016, more than three thousand <a href="../pcalhindex.html#biographies">biographical treatments</a> now appear on these pages. Each one is presented as developed as conditions and resources will permit at the time! However, <u>all</u> of them have been and will be <a href="../inprog.html">revised and updated</a>. Additionally, every new biography has been further informed by irregular sweeps of the <a href="irs.html">World Wide  Web</a>. It has become by far the most fruitful avenue of exploration. Incidentally, with individuals who are <a href="../na/na.html">NA</a>, our first link usually is to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a> biographical offering that usually appears high on any <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google.com</a> search as the most balanced and consistently accessible profile.

<p>Each biography includes a number of links to supporting information and to resources. The links also symbolize the interconnectiveness and interdependent nature of community life. At this point, individual biographies online fall into one of the following categories:</blockquote></font size>
<a name=bio></a><br>
<p><b>Biography:</b> A comprehensive exposition on a historically articulate Albany person for whom we have collected substantial material. All early Albany <a href="../cityfathers.html">leaders</a> should have such a treatment. To date, only a few (if any) full biographies have appeared. Those too are to be considered in-progress! 
<a name=profile></a>
<p><b>Biographical Profile:</b> A narrative containing most elements of a traditional biography that answers many life questions. Hopefully, all of the rank-and-file people of colonial Albany can look forward to a substantial profile on this website. The relative size of the "In-progress" <a href="../inprog.html">icon</a> provides a clue to how much more information we think we might be able to find/include. <a href="../welcome.html">Before too long</a>, every <a href="../familynames.html">major early Albany family</a> will have an overview family profile. 
<a name=sketch></a>
<p><b>Biographical Sketch:</b> Perhaps little more than connected research. Sketches are prematurely presented only to address the basic question of "Who?" Sometime sketches appear to be little more than notes. Please consider sketches as "a start," "better than nothing," "very sketchy," and an <a href="mailto:stefan.bielinski@nysed.gov">invitation</a> to contact us regarding additional thoughts or information!" 

<p>"<b>Baseline</b>" sketches contain only the barest information and are included for indexing purposes and to expose what we <b>do not</b> know about the subject. 

<p><a name=note></a>More skeletal than the baseline sketch, a <b>note</b> is the barest notice of a person's life in early Albany - maybe only one reference in the record. But that reference leads us to believe that the individual qualifies for inclusion in the early Albany community biography. Like the other fragments, it is made available to encourage interested people to contact us. </p>

<p>At the same time:

        <p><b>NOTE</b> on the notes - what you see is what we have or what we're able 
          to share. We have nothing more of value at the time of writing. Please 
          be patient and understand that we <a href="../res/inq.html">cannot respond</a> 
          directly to your request for more information. However, we will revisit 
          our offering and will incorporate any/all relevant additional information 
          thus uncovered.</p>

<font size=-1><p><a href="#top"><img src="../images/jpg/stickgray.jpg" border=0 alt="Biographical Studies" width=50 align=left vspace=4 hspace=4></a><b>E</b>ach of our individual <a name=bio></a><b>biographical studies</b> intends to shed light on basic life questions and issues. These relate to the three stages of a subject's life - birth and childhood, adulthood or maturity, and old age and death. Because a wildly variable range of resources are available on any individual's life at a given time, we will be more or less successful in interpreting -  exhibiting - portraying a particular person's life in website format. Of course, our success can change every day as new material becomes available and as we create or add to <a href="../pcalhindex.html#biographies">website biographies</a>.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are <u>some</u> of the basic questions and issues (things we want to understand) relating to an early Albany person's life that we are now studying: Family background; childhood; health; young adulthood; marriage and family issues; work history; economic profile - including work history and holdings; community standing; life beyond Albany; health throughout; declining years; and cause of death. This list is by no means complete. Look for those discussions in website biographies. The size of the <a href="../inprog.html">in progress icon</a> appearing on most biographies tells you how much we think we might be able to add about a particular person's life!</p></font size>
