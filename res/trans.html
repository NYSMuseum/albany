      <p>Translation, Transcription, and Transformation are so-called technical terms 
        describing processes <b>we</b> use in presenting source material (both 
        in manuscript and in original printed form) on the people of colonial 
        Albany and their world. For clarity, they are defined here as follows: 
      <p><a name=late></a><b>Translation</b>: Technically refers to changing (or translating) the original language of a historic/original resource into useful/modern English. Most often, this relates to Dutch language resources. In that case, we have needed to rely on the <a href="#pub">translations</a> published by at least <a href="../bios/staff/jopearson.html">one</a> nineteenth century provider, by <a href="../bios/staff/ajfvlaer.html">Arnold Van Laer</a> (who we consider to be a first-generation professional translator), and by Charles T. Gehring - in our view the latest and last word on Dutch language items in all mediums. We are mindful that translation (like history) is not a perfect science. Judgment is required. That begs the question, <a href="ts.html">who</a> do you trust? Thus, we realize that <a href="../bios/staff/sbstmt.html">we</a> probably cannot mine the research bottomland where foreign language sources are involved. Fortunately, in 1691, the English colonial "visionaries" mandated that at least public (legal) proceedings (written and vocal) were to be conducted in English. In Albany city that requirement was widely adopted by the 1790s.  

      <p><a name=scribe></a><b>Transcription</b>: The seemingly "simple" process of 
        making an English language manuscript or a printed document into a readable 
        and malleable text. Our first goal here is to first achieve a verbatim 
        transcription - exactly as written or printed in some archaic (not machine 
        readable) form. A pure transcription would be a lofty goal - as far as 
        it goes! 
      <p><a name=form></a><b>Transformation</b>: This process begins with a modern-type, 
        Internet-ready, blemish-free offspring of the above. The so-called typescript 
        is incorporated into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> 
        format. Nouns (persons, places, things) are defined/explained by linking 
        them to other pages on the Website and to external sources as well. Then 
        it becomes a page on the <a href="../index.html">People of Colonial Albany 
        Live Here Website</a>. </p>

</font size><p><a name=pub></a><FONT size=-1><a href="../victorian.html#munsell">Joel Munsell</a> presented many translated items in his massive works on early Albany. At this point, we do not know if he utilized translations made by anyone else beyond Jonathan Pearson - his most obvious provider. Perhaps another translator could have been Albany native <a href="../bios/e/jaeights2036.html">James Eights</a>. We suspect that he did, but have not identified them as yet! </font> <br>
