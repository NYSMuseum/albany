<p><b>I</b>n addition to and complementing our ongoing regular research program which has as its main goal to produce a <a href="bios.html">biographical profile</a> for every person who lived in early Albany, for the next three years the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> serves as the host for three doctoral level research and presentation initiatives related to the history of the city of Albany. The three scholars are supported by funding and  research resources and are designated as <b>New York State Museum Fellows</b>.</p>

<p>All three historians-in-residence are pursuing Ph.D. degrees in History at the <a href="http://www.albany.edu/history">University at Albany</a>. Besides producing the required doctoral thesis, these dissertation fellows will uncover historical resources that will become part of the collections of the New York State Museum. At the same time, we are delighted to see that each of them is finding ways to share their experiences with audiences beyond the traditional academy!</p>

<p>These are exciting times in 3090 CEC. The project offices in the Cultural Education Center are vibrating with new intellectual energy as these young women go about their daily business. We are indeed fortunate to have them! They are:
