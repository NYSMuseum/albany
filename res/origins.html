<p><b>M</b>ore than two thirds of the 16,000 people who meet the <a href="../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion in the People of Colonial Albany study population were actually born within the city of Albany. Our <a href="../cbr.html">com</a>munity-based <a href="../guide/histres.html">research program</a> has told us much about their origins and backgrounds. These boys and girls represent the core city population - born within the defined <a href="../citylimits.html">city limits</a>.

<p>At the same time, please be aware that almost half of those Albany children did not <a href="../children.html">live</a> long enough to reach adulthood, are mostly historically mute, and thus must take a <a href="../children.html">back seat</a> to the adults - generally speaking that is! For the sometimes silent majority of the native born "Albanians," our sweep of <a href="../cbr.html">community-based resources</a> has yielded substantial material with which to sketch out their life course profiles. 

<p>However, for the <a href="../nnd.html">original settlers</a> (in the community at its founding in 1664) and for those newcomers who came to Albany afterwards, their pre-Albany stories are far more challenging. In the days before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</a>, searching for origins and backgrounds of <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> was a far more arduous task when accessibility to a comparative handful of printed 
<a href="../fhg.html">family-based resources</a>, actual legwork for research, or what I still recall as tedious and frustrating correspondence, made origins research a veritable "needle-in-a-haystack" experience.

<p><a href="../newcomers.html">Newcomers</a> came into the community on a regular basis (true then as well as now). A small percentage of those who entered the city limits stayed on for a year, a decade, or a lifetime. Finding the answer to the marquee question on this page is part of every biographical initiative. We now start with an <a href="irs.html">Internet</a> search under a range of <a href="sp.html">spellings</a> and identity terms. That initial search invariably leads in so many interesting directions. Stay tuned for much more on this task.

<p>Finally (for now), our quest for places of origin for <a href="../criteria.html">our</a> early Albany people frequently and quickly has led us to a research type of publication/printing/webwork that we call (a term of convenience) a <a href="ts.html">Traditional Source</a>. This general resource type is frequently considered and discussed on this <a href="../index.html">website</a>. </p>
