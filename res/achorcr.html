<p>Albany County and City Records
<dd>Location:    Albany County Hall of Records
<dd>Arrangement: Numerically; grouped by subject
<dd>Indexing:    None

<p><b>Series Description:</b> &nbsp;This collection, originally stored in <a href="../loc/cityhall.html">City Hall</a>, was transferred to 
the custody of the State Regents in 1911. This transfer was prompted by an 
1880 City Hall fire that destroyed numerous valuable documents.  The 
collection, which is comprised of 300 cubic feet of Albany County records 
and 65 cubic feet of Albany City records, was transferred from the State 
Archives and Records Administration (S.A.R.A.) to the custody of the city 
and county of Albany after their archives were established.The records 
within the Constitutional Era provide evidence of an expanding city with 
growing needs.  The record group includes deeds, leases, land patents, 
election records, assessment rolls, Alms House records, laws and 
resolutions of the <a href="../corporation.html">Common Council</a>, Chamberlain accounts, and other records relating to the functions of city government.


<p><b>Albany City Records</b>. 1726-1895. 47 file boxes.

<p>Common Council Records
	
<p><dd>	Albany's 1686 Dongan Charter defined the power of the Common Council 
to make laws and ordinances.  By charter provision the Common Council was 
thus established as the legislative body of the city.  Members of the Common 
Council were also Commissioners of Highways for the City of Albany.  
Accordingly, this collection contains a large number of documents relating 
to the maintenance and development of the city's streets and roads. 
The role of the Common Council has remained relatively unaltered. Today, 
as a legislative body, it reviews and acts on legislation and resolutions 
for the government of the City and the management of its business.

<p><a name=treas></a><b><a href="../corporation.html#treas">Chamberlain's Records</a></b>. (1783-1815).
	The Chamberlain or treasurer was elected by the members of the city corporation.  The Chamberlain received and disbursed all moneys raised by tax in the city.  This included such duties as collection of all assessments, apportionments, and rents and also the disbursement of salaries and payment of corporation expenses.  Today, the responsibilities of the city treasurer have changed little and include collection,custody and deposit of all taxes and other city funds.  The treasurer's office annually processes the billing and collection of property and other tax accounts.
