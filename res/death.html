<p><a href="#sources">A</a>mong its basic <a href="../guide/histres.html#obj">research objectives</a>, the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> seeks to establish an age at  and cause of death for <u>each</u> of the <a href="../criteria.html">16,000</a> people who lived in the city of Albany before the Industrial Revolution. However, for an age of imperfect vital statistics, both tasks are proving to be quite daunting!</p>

      <p>We know that Americans today live much longer than they did two or three hundred 
        years ago. Generally, we believe that is due to better diet, personal 
        hygiene, and the eradication or control of sicknesses, infections, and 
        diseases that often proved fatal in times past. Pre and postnatal care 
        of newborns also influences longevity. Overall statistics are skewed to 
        longevity today because so few babies born in our time (especially in 
        the so-called enlightened parts of the world) died before the end of infancy 
        in contrast with as much as a 50% infant mortality rate in colonial Albany.</p>

<p>Death information provides important insights into peoples' lives. Sickness and suffering were sometimes noted in sources including official records or public and private organizations, in correspondence, observations, and <a href="../guide/histres.html#probate">wills</a>.

<p>Two great epidemics claimed significant portions of the Albany population in 1731-31 (when perhaps 10% of the city's people died) and a century later with <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k2pL9c00rl4C&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=albany+cholera+1832&source=bl&ots=0_nWj_6B0o&sig=afSTC552kleMmoSw6tda5n4FpsM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=soroUIL0IeHa0QG90IDwCw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=albany%20cholera%201832&f=false">cholera</a> in 1832 which claimed 136 residents in July alone.

      <p>We now begin a chronological list of specific causes of death of early Albany 
        people. "Begin" is the key word here! This exposition will develop itself 
        as new biographical studies are added. We have not yet worked at this 
        feature but hope you grasp our intent here!
