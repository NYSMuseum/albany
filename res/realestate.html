<p><b>T</b>his page <a href="../inprog.html">begins to consider</a> the subjects of real estate and real property transactions in early Albany. Real estate (land) holdings were the most common outlets for wealth for most <a href="../criteria.html">members</a> of the early Albany community. Ownership of a piece of land within the city limits qualified a person for a place on the community <a href="../census1790.html#first">mainline</a>.</p>

<p>Although the Colonial Albany Project is mostly concerned with real property issues within the <a href="../citylimits.html">boundaries</a> of the city of Albany, we also track the external (out of Albany) real estate history of <a href="../criteria.html">early Albany residents</a> - but in a less definitive way!</p>

<p>Houselots within <a href="../beverwyck.html#lots">Beverwyck</a> were defined during the 1650s. After 1664, some real estate transactions are chronicled in the <a href="../sources.html#era"><i>Early Records of Albany</i></a>. After 1691, other deed and mortgage transactions were filed with the Albany County Clerk. However, much of the real property turnover occurred within families as city houses and lots were passed through generations. Only some of those  transmissions are described in the <a href="../pcalhindex.html#wills">wills</a> of family members or were referenced in a variety of documents generated many years afterwards.</p>
<a name=lease></a>
        <p>The basic real property unit for early Albany people would be their 
          houselot (where they lived) located within the Albany city limits. Other 
          pieces of real estate (stores, smithy's etc., storehouses and sheds, 
          lots, and smaller-often irregular pieces of property) were held by many 
          city residents as well. A few residents owned <a href="../bios/j/wj.html">many</a> 
          such parcels. Special real property features (docks, <a href="../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>, 
          easement strips, stream beds) were leased (even though the official 
          term used was "sold") to favored residents for specified time spans 
          and are described within individual biographies. 
        <p>Some Albany people were able to acquire acreage beyond the Albany city 
          limits. The <a href="../bios/s/schuyler.html">Schuylers</a>, <a href="../bios/b/bleecker.html">Bleeckers</a>, 
          and <a href="../bios/t/tbroeck.html">Ten Broecks</a> were among the 
          elite Albanians who owned substantial lands beyond Albany. Most affluent, 
          long-time residents held some additional real estate - some of it <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">rented</a> 
          from the Van Rensselaers
        <p>From the time of the English takeover in 1664 and until the end of 
          British rule in New York, a number of British-connected newcomers (some 
          of whom became Albany residents) were able to secure "royal patents" 
          for lands beyond the Albany <a href="../citylimits.html">city limits</a> 
          and those of <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck 
          as well. The land grant history of the province of New York has been 
          <a href="#pat">studied</a> in detail but not comprehensively. Those 
          grants have been charted as they relate to the lives of actual early 
          Albany residents. 
        <p>One of our <a href="../guide/histres.html#obj">research objectives</a> is a complete title history of every piece of property within the original boundaries of the city. We have made <a href="../loc/schuylerhouse.html">some progress</a> in this area but still are near the beginning of that initiative.</p>

<p><a name=na></a>Early Albany people also held (by deed and lease) real property in surrounding <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, at <a href="../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>, <a href="../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a>, at <a href="../na/sarapat.html">Saratoga</a>, at <a href="../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga</a>, in greater <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>, and <a href="../im/imsauthier.html">beyond</a>. We know that such out-of-Albany holdings are <a href="#patents">numerous</a> and also that we have only touched on those properties. After in-city holdings, we consider them very important!

<p><a name=ar></a>After the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">Revolution</a>, a number of Albany people were in position to buy up titles to lands in <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyclinto/1798tax.html">northern</a> and central New York initially granted to soldiers and also lands confiscated from loyalists. We <a href="../guide/histres.html#coldoc">intend</a> to chart and integrate those acquisitions as well.

<p>For nineteenth century real property perspectives on eighteenth century Albany, the following sources represent likely starting points and have been consulted frequently by project researchers:
<img src="../images/modern/1841bl.jpg" align=right width=50 border=1 vspace=1 hspace=4 alt="Snapshot of title page of 1841 Basin List">The <a href="../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> (annual beginning in 1813);
<dd>Published and multi-volumed <a href="../guide/histres.html#rpr"><i>Grantor-Grantee</i></a> Indexes;
<dd>several categories of <a href="../guide/histres.html#engineer">historical maps</a>;
        <dd> and a printed descriptive "list of those benefiting from an enlargement of 
          the opening of the Albany pier from State to Columbia" which describes 
          most of the city of Albany real estate located along the river. We refer 
          to this numbered lot-by-lot and structure guide (organized by street) 
          as the "1841 Basin List." The parcels are linked to a historic map of 
          the of the city dated 1843. More on this resource in the future! <BR>

        <FONT size=-1>The principal printed resources for Albany real estate transactions are considered in the project <a href="../guide/histres.html#rpr"><i>Guide</i></a>.

<p><a name=pat></a>Lands beyond the Albany orbit (above): These tracts in the unsettled and fringe parts of the colony and are approachable from the <a href="../sources.html#clp"><i>Calendar of Land Papers</i></a>. We recognize that we cannot hope to do more than open the information door to the beyond-Albany real estate holdings of early Albany people.
