<p>Throughout the long-term process of creating, building, and improving <a href="../welcome.html"><i>The People of Colonial Albany Live Here</i></a> Website, we have solicited reactions from its  casual surfers/users/readers/fans and critics. This was done in the spirit of "first do no harm" - which was appropriated from another important discipline. This editorial initiative has worked famously as useful suggestions have come to us on almost a daily basis.

<p>More than fifteen years later, we still operate under that first rule. But now, we are in a much better position to "make stuff right" while we continue to augment and improve what has become a massive exploration/<a href="../index.html">exposition</a> on the <b>people</b> of colonial Albany and their world.
