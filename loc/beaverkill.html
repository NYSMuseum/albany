            <p><b>T</b>he <a href="#sources">Beaverkill</a> is a term referring to one of 
              the <a href="#streams">three major streams</a> that flowed from 
              the west, cut through colonial Albany, and emptied into the Hudson 
              River.</p>
            <a href="#map"><img src="../images/bvrkl1790.jpg" width=200 height=405 align=left alt="the Beaverkill - 1790" border=2 hspace=6 vspace=2></a>Today, 
            the Beaverkill is almost entirely underground - flowing through pipes 
            and culverts but still along its historic route. Water for the Beaverkill 
            came out of the ground above today's Albany High School campus and 
            wound its way "downtown" between today's Western and Washington Avenues.
            <p></p>
            <p>It crosses under Western Avenue near Quail Street, flows behind 
              Elberon Place, forms the bed of Washington Park Lake, crosses Madison 
              Avenue at New Scotland, flows east along today's Myrtle Avenue, 
              behind Hackett Middle School, meandered across Delaware Avenue, 
              and into Lincoln Park.
            <p></p>
            East of Lark Street, the Beaverkill has two distinct stretches: From 
            Lark to South Pearl, stream ran downhill creating enough flow for 
            a milling complex on the upper portion and a slaughterhouse near Pearl 
            Street.
            <p></p>
            <p>Its early Albany history began when a mill was first erected at 
              the "Buttermilk Falls" at the imaginary intersection of today's 
              Hawk Street. The first century of of the story is entertwined with 
              the development of <a href="wendellmills.html">Wendell's Mills</a>. 
            <p>Further downstream, it separated the two large estates built by 
              General Philip <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler</a> 
              and attorney Peter W. <a href="../loc/yatesmansion.html">Yates</a>. 
            <p>The final, lowland stretch of the Beaverkill (east of <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">South 
              Pearl Street</a>) ran through the Pastures and into the Hudson just 
              south of the <a href="ferry.html">ferry house</a>. The <a href="../bios/c/geocharles7588.html">Charles</a> 
              family meat production and <a href="../trades/tanner.html">tannery</a> 
              sites were located east of <a href="../im/imspearldiag.html#3">South 
              Pearl Street</a> between the Beaverkill and the road to the <a href="ferry.html">ferry</a>.</P>
            <p>In 1689, <a href="../bios/vd/mewvdp.html">Melgert Wynantse Vanderpoel</a> 
              petitioned the Albany government for the right to erect a sawmill 
              on the Beaverkill. He owned that mill until his death in 1710. In 
              1715, <a href="../bios/v/frhvisscher4069.html">Frederick Harmanse 
              Visscher</a> reportedly owned a mill on the stream.</p>

            <p><a name=sources></a><b>Sources:</b> This exposition has been formed 
              from community-based information and a close reading of city maps. 
              It also benefits from research conducted by historian <a href="../bios/staff/tbbio.html">Tricia 
              Barbagallo</a> for a school-based program entitled "Life Along the 
              Beaverkill: A History Walk through Lincoln Park," which she presented 
              in conjunction with the Thomas O'Brien Academy of Science and Technology 
              (TOAST) during 1995. Materials from it are on file at the project 
              office.</p>
