<p><a href="#sources"><b>Wendell's Mills</b></a> were located along the <a href="beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a> and were a well-known early Albany landmark for more than a hundred years. The site included a grist mill and later several factory buildings. They were part of larger family <a href="../res/realestate.html">real property</a> holdings that probably extended south from the family <a href="../census1790.html#2740">homes</a> on upper State Street until they bordered the Schuyler <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">holdings</a> south of the Beaverkill.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century, at least two mills reputedly were built along the Beaverkill. But their exact location is unclear. In 1729, attorney <a href="../bios/w/evwendell2657.html">Evert Wendell</a> petitioned the <a href="../corporation.html">city council</a> for:<br>

<blockquote><font size=-1><a href="#council">"</a>three or four acres of ground for to build the mill on, lying on the north side of the aforesaid Beaver Kill, it being part of the land which <a href="../bios/w/evwendell2655.html">Evert Wendell</a> late of this city had in his life cleared, and also the kill and the use of the water, and also free liberty to make a dam so far distant from the mill up the said kill or creek till he shall have fall enough for his said mill, together with so much ground to lye a gutter from the said dam to the said mill and also liberty to make a wagon path from the mill to the city . . . [it] will be the first grist mill that ever was built within the limits of this city altho' the water has runned there for no us ever since the settlement of this city<a href="#council">"</a></font size></blockquote> 

          <p><a href="../bios/w/abewendell2739.html#portrait"><img src="../images/awmill.jpg" hspace=4 vspace=4 align=left border=1 width=200 alt="Abraham E. Wendell and his mill - 1737"></a>Although 
            the city council deferred action on that petition claiming the creek 
            and property requested belonged to the Albany <a href="../drc.html">Dutch 
            Reformed Church</a>, apparently Wendell did build several processing 
            plants in association with "his" Beaver Creek property. His <a href="../wills/willevwendell2657.html">will</a> 
            dated 1749 referred to a saw mill, gristmill, and brew house. Wendell 
            instructed his sons to build a chocolate factory perhaps on that property 
            as well. Prior to that time, son <a href="../bios/w/abewendell2739.html">Abraham 
            E. Wendell</a> had been so involved with the site that his portrait 
            was painted in 1737 with his mill in the background. Powered by water 
            from the Beaverkill, the Wendells ran those mills almost to the end 
            of the century.</p>

          <p>By the time of the American Revolution, a wagon road did connect Wendell's 
            Mills to the city of Albany. The Albany <a href="../map/mapdewitt.html">maps</a> 
            drawn during the 1790s by State surveyor Simeon De Witt make "Wendell's 
            Mills" a prominent south Albany feature. However, by that time, the 
            mill-related activities of the aging Wendell brothers are less than 
            prominent in the historical record. By 1800, a traveller described 
            the Beaverkill ravine and noted that Wendell's mills had been abandoned. 
            In 1802, <a href="#map1802"><img src="../images/mapphwendell1802.jpg" hspace=8 vspace=4 align=left border=1 width=300 alt="Philip Wendell's Beaverkill property - 1802"></a>a map was made of <a href="../bios/w/phwendell2702.html">Philip 
            Wendell's</a> Beaverkill property. Shortly thereafter, Wendell and 
            his <a href="../bios/p/sapackard.html">wife</a> sold forty acres of 
            what he described as "pasture" to developers Abraham G. Wendell and 
            David Waters.
			
<p>In 1900, the area was <a href="http://alloveralbany.com/archive/2010/04/13/lincoln-park----from-beer-bricks-and-beavers">known</a> as Beaver Park and was opened as Albany's first public playground. Ambitious subsequent <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jX8AAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22beaver%20park%22%20albany&lr&as_brr=1&pg=PA51#v=onepage&q=%22beaver%20park%22%20albany&f=false">plans</a> called for athletic fields, a track, natural areas, baths, walkways, and a pool. 			
			
<p>Today, the mill site sits beneath the basin of Lincoln Park - perhaps nearby the Lincoln Park pool. The Beaverkill, which provided the water to power the mill, has largely been piped and is beneath the park as it still flows downhill, down Arch Street, across South Pearl, South 
Broadway, and into the Hudson.</p>
