<p>Today, the Albany <a href="../res/realestate.html">real property</a> known as "48 Hudson Avenue" is the currently existing remains/shells of several buildings at that address dating at least into the first half of the eighteenth century. Today, this part of the historic community landscape is often referred to as "The Van Ostrande-Radliff House." As such, it has achieved considerable  <a href=https://www.google.com/#q=Van+Ostrande-Radliff+House"">notoriety</a> in the popular if not so historical record.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22norton+samuel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22norton%20samuel%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first published city directory identified <a href="../bios/n/sanorton.html">Samuel Norton</a>, a mason, as the occupant of 48 Hudson.

        <p>Today, <a href="http://www.twcnews.com/nys/capital-region/news/2016/06/30/albany-archives-48-hudson-avenue-oldest-building.html?cid=facebook_YNN-Albany">48 Hudson Avenue</a> 
          is owned by the <a href="http://www.historic-albany.org/">Historic Albany 
          Foundation</a> - for many years, the most responsible steward of our 
          city's built environment. Hopefully, HAF serves as its principal advocate 
          now and for the foreseeable future. <br>

<p><a name=source></a>This description page relies on <a href="../cbr.html">community-based resources</a> but also incorporates <a href="../res/ts.html">traditional sources</a> and lore but with cautions where appropriate. Its purpose is to introduce new information and perspective on an element of the "what" and "where" in the lives of the people of colonial Albany and not to embellish the existing material/wisdom/lore. It does, however, it provide some links to the most useful of the existing sources.</p>
