<p><a href="#term">Gallows Hill</a> is a <a href="../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional term used to describe a special place in colonial Albany!</p>

<p>The name first was used during the early 1700s when a number of <a href="../newcomers.html">new residents</a> purchased lots "at the foot of Gallows Hill." Those properties would have been along what became <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a>. By the 1720s, the location also was referenced as the site of a <a href="../bios/h/luhooghkerk3603.html">brickyard</a> or brick kiln. Although the name evokes images of hangings and probably was not selected without justification, scant evidence of executions on the site appears in the community's eighteenth century <a href="../cbr.html">record</a>.</p>

<p>British army maps from the 1750s and 60s showed an elevated area south of the <a href="ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> and at least some distance west of the cow path that later became Washington Street and then <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a>. The <a href="../map/map1765.html">map of 1765</a> (<font size=-1>enhanced detail shown here</font size>) features a prominent knoll located a block west of or above the street.
		
		
 <p>On July 26, 1762, the city council <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA133&lpg=PA33&dq=%22gallows+hill&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo&id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&ots=wwdCeXsdiv#v=onepage&q=%22gallows%20hill&f=false">resolved</a> that the "the Ground laying beyond the Fort to the west where the Gallows now stands, as far as the [?] <i>Schyt Bergje</i>  [and also the]   Grounds on the Gallows Hill be laid out in acre lots and to be disposed of at Publick Auction for twenty-one years." The duration time refers to the <a href="../res/realestate.html">leasing</a> practice favored by Albany <a href="../corporation.html">leaders</a>. At that time, the minutes referenced "
		
		
<p> In July 1764, <a href="../bios/s/cortschuyler1260.html">Cortland Schuyler</a> "bought" eleven acres on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA149&lpg=PA149&dq=%22gallows+%22schuyler&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo&id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&ots=wwdCeXsdiv#v=onepage&q=%22gallows%20schuyler%20&f=false">Gallows Hill</a> at the head of State Street. However,  within a few months, the city council; voided the sale and sold the parcel to <a href="../bios/w/abewendell2739.html">Abraham Wendell</a> .


 <p>In September 1787, the city council acted on a growing list of complaints and proposals regarding the lots on Gallows Hill and re-assigned a number of those parcels to new owners.   

<p>During the 1790s, several maps referenced a more extensive layout of lots on "Gallows Hill." These bear more investigation.</p>

<p>During the nineteenth century, the term also referenced the high ground located south of the Ruttenkill gorge - near the site of the Colonial Albany Project offices at the Cultural Education Center. Sometimes, we call our home base on Madison Avenue "<a href="../art/art-welcome.html">the Gallows Hill Facility</a>!" </p>

<p>Many other pre-industrial communities <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=%22gallows+hill%22&hl=en&rlz=1R2ADRA_enUS360&prmd=ivnsb&tbs=tl:1&tbo=u&ei=veNnTZ37N8P88Abwn-CSCw&sa=X&oi=timeline_result&ct=more-results&resnum=15&ved=0CHgQ6AIwDg&bav=on.1,or.&fp=42ea6e12edc6080">had</a> "special places" called "Gallows Hill!"</p>

<P><FONT size=-1><a name=term></a>Although the name "Gallows Hill" has been used in many <a href="../books.html">traditional histories</a> of Albany, we have yet to find a definition or description of the place or direct evidence that hangings took place there before the American Revolution. We believe that the executions following the <a href="../fire.html">Fire of 1793</a> were held on the hill near the present State Capitol. Perhaps that location was called "Gallows Hill" as well!</p>
