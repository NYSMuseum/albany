<P><FONT size=+1>T</FONT size>he coming of peace in <a href="../or/or-eb.html">1783</a> signaled a rise in building construction to accommodate a <a href="../art/art-jls.html#pop">booming</a>         population and also the enhanced ambitions of the victorious <a href="../or/or-3r.html">revolutionaries</a>. Second only to its neighbor, <a href="schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a>, and also within the city's <a href="../citylimits.html">borders</a>, this elegant home was located south of the urban <a href="../lastdays.html">core</a> and was built by attorney <a href="../bios/y/pwyates.html">Peter W. Yates</a>. It sat on a ridge north of the <a href="beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. On the south side of the Beaverkill ravine was larger city estate of General <a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a>. The precise construction date for Yates Mansion is not known but it still was unfinished in 1784 when it was referenced by a young <a href="../res/visitors.html#alco">visitor</a>. During the <a href="../census1790.html#4430">1790</a>s, Yates's family of ten lived in a large house surrounded by orchards and outbuildings. A decade later, the size of his <a href="../census1800.html#4430">household</a> had shrunk to three adult members and was served by four slaves.

<p>Peter Waldron Yates <a href="../wills/willjoyates4479.html">inherited</a> the property in 1776. He paid taxes on it as early as <a href="../lists/list1779tlm.html#pwylot">1779</a> when it was shown (as a lot only) on a city assessment roll for the <a href="../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. At that time, his actual <a href="../lists/list1779tlm.html#4430">residence</a> was located closer to the city core.  

<p>"Yates Mansion" was the subject of a <a href="#sjh">painting</a> by St. John Honeywood done about 1795. It is pictured prominently on the <a href="../map/mapdewitt.html">city maps</a> made by Simeon De Witt during the same decade. It also was featured in an architectural drawing.

<p>In <a href="../lists/list1788tl.html#4430">1788</a>, his new holdings were valued substantially on the <a href="../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the real estate of Peter W. Yates was assessed at $20,790 - making it second only to neighboring Schuyler Mansion in value.

<p>In 1809, Yates is <a href="http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:fP1unkRP4j4J:www.archivesandcollections.org/archives/images/presentations/OlcottProfile_byMcClintock.pdf+%22james+kane%22+albany&cd=72&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">said</a> to have sold it to newcomer businessman <a href="../bios/k/jakane.html">James Kane</a>. Kane either rebuilt or enhanced the landmark property.<a href="http://blog.syracuse.com/entertainment/2012/05/restored_painting_kanes_walk_r.html"><img src="../images/jpg/bldg/kanemansion.jpg" align=right height=200 border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Seward Mansion Albany"></a> The "Mansion" at the corner of Westerlo and Broad Streets later was the residence of Governors Tompkins, De Witt Clinton and Seward. In 1838, Governor William H. Seward <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FTTmls3FTcMC&pg=PA381&lpg">described</a> his new Albany home in delightful detail.

<p>Growing up in Albany during the 1840s and '50s, one-time <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ixFKAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=yates+mansion&source=web&ots=xBtg2RX3-g&sig=MCsp559-_zuQKtfUGARf9DECs54#PPA8,M1">resident</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Y._Satterlee">Henry Yates Satterlee</a> later became the "first Episcopal bishop of Washington".

<p>In June 1856, "the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA621&lpg=PA621&dq=yates+mansion&source=web&ots=GwGctht1ek&sig=tQieWRj4moumPh_HL9H3t4m68fo">old Yates Mansion</a> on Broad Street" was purchased by Thomas W. Olcott for $16,000 "for the use of the principal of the Female Academy."

<p>Then by 1864, it had been sold again (to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmaus_United_Methodist_Church">Ash Grove Methodist Church</a>) and was demolished by its new owner to build a new Ash Grove Methodist Church. That building is said to have been razed in 1918.

<P>Yates Mansion was one of the landmark homes of of post-revolutionary <a href="../or/or-3r.html">war</a> Albany. The built environment of early Albany is considered more broadly in a theme essay entitled "<A href="../homes.html">Homes for the People</A>."</P>

The purpose of this offering is to locate and consider the site and building over its first decades of existence. Any unique perspectives focus on its first owner. We have not considered the architectural, material, and later history of the property. For the building itself, begin with a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&q=%22yates+mansion%22+#tbm=bks&q=%22yates+mansion%22+albany">Google.com search</a> on the subject.
