<P><A href="elmtreecorner.html#elmtree"><IMG align=right alt="Elm Tree Corner - 1814" border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 src="../images/jpg/eelmtreecrnr250.jpg" width=300></A> 
            <B>T</B>he <a href="#int">intersection</a> of State and Pearl Streets was one of early 
            Albany's principal <A href="../streets.html">crossroads</A>. During 
            the seventeenth century, it was a Van Rensselaer family property that 
            devolved to <a href="../bios/s/alschuyler95.html">Alida Schuyler Van 
            Rensselaer Livingston</a>. A well-known landmark in historical circles, it has been the <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=%22elm+tree+corner%22+albany&hl=en&prmd=imvnsb&ei=3PS3TtPBE4m02gXq24jNDQ&start=10&sa=N&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=4983e9505d3f5f2a&biw=1420&bih=564">subject</a> of much <a href="../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional lore.</P>

<P>The name commemorates a <a href="../res/ts.html">legendary</a> elm tree that reputedly was planted in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=%22elm+tree%22&source=web&ots=GvPbphu15l&sig=Dtbv0IEvNKuiVlhNYwK8ZzEHWQ8#v=onepage&q=%22elm%20tree%22&f=false">1735</a> by a young <a href="../bios/l/phlivingston86.html">Philip Livingston</a> in front of his <a href="../bios/l/rlivingston94.html">father's</a> house on the northwestern corner. In <a href="../census1756.html#115">1756</a>, the building still belonged to the Livingston family and was used as a headquarters by the British army. In the days before <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_elm_disease">D</a>utch Elm Disease all but obliterated the <a href="http://www.elmcare.com/disease/dutchelm/dutch_elm_disease.htm">species</a>, that tree grew to be an Albany landmark.

<p>By the 1780s, the northwest side was known as "Webster's Corner" as the yellow frame building was then the printery and newspaper office of <A href="../census1790.html#webster">Charles R.</a> and <a href="../census1790.html#webster">George Webster</a>. The old-style structure on the northeastern corner was the landmark Lydius House - at that time the residence of the reclusive <a href="../bios/l/blydius4620.html">Baltus Lydius</a>. North, along the western side of <a href="../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>, was the double townhouse called "<a href="vdhpalace.html">Vanderheyden Palace</a>."  This picture (probably created from the vantage point of the old <a href="schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler house</a>) shows the intersection and those landmarks in 1815 when the elm tree would have been about 90 years old.</P>

<p>Over the years, the location was the site of a number of stores and other establishments. Prior to the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">Revolution</a>, it housed the bookstore of <a href="../bios/w/stwilson.html">Stuart Wilson</a>; the "Blue Belle Tavern," last run by <a href="../bios/s/jobstafford.html">Job Stafford</a>; and, after 1837, a piano factory.

<P>Subsequent engravings and photographs documented the growth of the tree and evolution of this pivotal location. The old elm tree was removed on June 15, 1877. The choice corner location later was a bookstore (razed 1859), Tweedle Hall, then a skyscraper called the Ten Eyck Hotel (razed in 1971). Today, the corner is occupied by a bank building - where the tablet shown here is incorporated in its wall.</P>
