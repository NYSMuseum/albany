<b>T</b>he <a href="#burgiss">image shown above</a> is from a larger panorama of the city as the artist might have remembered it in about 1717. It shows the slope of the hill and the waterfront at low tide! <a href="#click">Click</a> on any feature for more information.





<p><b>T</b>he <a href="../earlycity.html">colonial city</a> of Albany was situated on the west bank of the Hudson River - on a hillside rising westward and away from the waterfront. The initial settlement - a trading post called <a href="../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>, sat on the flood plain near the water's edge, south of the subsequent urban core, was located beyond the left edge of this image. By the <a href="..//lists/list1660.html">1660s</a>, enterprising fur traders had <a href="../lists/list1650s.html">acquired</a> lots and had built a number of homes along the river to the north of the original trading post.</p>

<p>By 1660, a <a href="../map/map1676.html">wooden stockade</a> encircled the village first called <a href="../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. At that time, most of the settled area was on the flood plain with some new construction moving up the hillside - but not yet reaching today's Pearl Street to the west.</p>

<p>After 1664, the settlement - now called Albany began to expand up the hillside. The <a href="../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> built by the English in 1676 straddled a ridge above two riverbound streams and was located about halfway up the hill that ran west from the river. For most of the colonial period, the fort was situated <a href="../map/map1765.html">above</a> community settlement.</P>

<p>My favorite artist's representational diagram dated <a href="../im/im1686.html">1686</a> and an engineer's map dated at <a href="../im/imroemer.html">1698</a> 
            help illustrate community features. 
          <p>At the same time, a number of streams flowed through the city. These ran west-to-east and downhill and emptied into the Hudson River. They exist today but are buried beneath the streets. From north to south, they are <a href="../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>, the <a href="../loc/ruttenkill.html">RuttenKill</a>, and the <a href="../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. Each of these streams cut deeply into the west bank hillside - creating <a href="../art/ravines.html">ravines</a> whose banks/sides were eroded by runoff water. The high (dry and stable) ground between the ravines was considered prime building property. Albany's <a href="../streets.html">main streets</a> ran east to west along these ridges. From north to south, these main streets were Patroon (Clinton),<a href="../streets.html#state">State</a>, <a href="../streets.html#lydius">Lydius</a> (Madison Avenue), and Morton (today Avenue) Streets.</p>
