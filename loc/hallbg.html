            The Halenbeek Burial Ground
          </center>
          </font size> 
        <p>This ancient landmark, which occupied the southwest corner of <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">South 
          Pearl</a> and Hamilton streets, was removed in June, 1860, and attracted 
          such crowds of people, curious to witness the process, that the police 
          force was called in to disperse them, to enable the workmen to pursue 
          their labor. 
        <p>The ground was set apart by Hendrik Halenbeek in the middle of the 
          last century and formally dedicated to the purposes of a burial place 
          for his family. It was near the north line of his farm, which extended 
          from Plain street to the <a href="beaverkill.html">Beaver kil</a> at 
          Arch street, where it adjoined the <a href="schuylermansion.html">farm</a> 
          of Gen. Schuyler, the south line at Pearl street being designated by 
          a cannon, which remained in the ground until a few years ago, when it 
          was removed by Joseph Fry, while excavating his lots near Arch street. 
          The boundaries of this property east and west are claimed to have extended 
          from the river to <a href="../streets.html#eagle">Eagle street</a>; 
          and that South Pearl street, was laid out by the said Hendrik through 
          his property, and given by him for a street. Below <a href="../streets.html#lydius">Lydius 
          street</a>, South Peart street from the earliest time was undoubtedly 
          the <a href="../na/bethlehem.html">Bethleham</a> road, being the margin 
          of the river at high water; and as nearly all the pasture and water 
          lots below Lydius street belonged to the Dutch church, if any portion 
          of the farm ever reached the river proper. it must have been a strip 
          running down between Hudson and Lydius streets. Its western boundary 
          is uncertain, but it seems to have extended well towards Eagle &nbsp; 
          [411] &nbsp; street. Through this farm a street was laid out at an early 
          day, sixty feet wide, and called Halenbeek street. The descendants also 
          lay claim to an island as once belonging to their domain, and the extent 
          of the estate, by tradition, was 1,800 acres, in various places. This 
          was long since reduced to the narrow limits of the burial place, and 
          half of that had been taken for a street. So firmly were the heirs bound 
          to preserve this spot for the purposes to which it was set apart, that 
          for many years after it became desirable on all accounts to remove it, 
          the wisest heads were puzzled how to effect their purpose. The will 
          of Hendrik Halenbeek, hereto annexed, strictly enjoined upon those who 
          came after him not to allow any one to be buried there who refused to 
          contribute to its maintenance. The first innovation made upon it was 
          by the opening of Hamilton street. Very few interments, however, had 
          been made in it for many years previous to its removal. Among the most 
          observable were those of <a href="../bios/s/spstaff.html">Spencer Stafford</a> who married Dorothy Halenbeck, 
          and died in 1845; and William Austin, whose wife was Dorothy, daughter 
          of Anthony (mentioned in the will below) who died in 1850. The male 
          descendants were by this time so much dispersed that there were few 
          remaining in the city that bore the name; but a number of female descendants 
          who were married still resided here, of whom a few are now living. The 
          property had, therefore, become a considerable burden upon a few individuals, 
          who resolved to allow it to be sold for taxes. Application was made 
          to the legislature for that purpose, and in 1849, a report was made 
          favorable to its removal. (Sons-in-law) <a href="../bios/b/lebenedict.html">Lewis Benedict</a>, John O. Cole, William Austin 
          and Alexander Mc Hard, were appointed trustees. These had the property 
          sold for taxes, and it was purchased for them for aperiod of one thousand 
          years. They sold a portion and rented the west end to the Messrs. Bfackall, 
          from the proceeds of which they were enabled to purchase thirty-seven 
          lots in the Rural Cemetery, whither the remains of the dead were removed, 
          and a monument erected at a cost of $1,500. The city authorities ordered 
          the widening of Hamilton street, so as to take in nearly the whole ground, 
          and the passer by would not suspect that it had ever been the site of 
          a cemetery. During the cholera of 1832, some interments were made in 
          this ground, when the authorities required that the trenches should 
          be dug nine feet deep, so that no infection might arise. The original 
          dimensions of the burial place seem to have been 60 feet square. 
        <p>
        <dd>The present Grand street was laid out through this farm, and called 
          Halenbeek street. In 1829, the city surveyor presented to the common 
          council a profile of this street from Hudson to Hamilton street. Althoughh 
          it had nearly a century before been laid out and named, no vestige of 
          a street had yet been made there. That portion of it south of Lydius 
          street was used only as a lane leading to the barn of Oliver Kane (now 
          the site of Ash Grove Church), across which swung a common gate. It 
          was usually written Hallenbake, and Hallenbeck, the latter being the 
          accepted mode of writing now, although <i>bek</i> signifies beak or 
          nose, the letter <i><c></i> being rarly used in that language; hence 
          names derived from common words, like <i>ten eyk, beekman and bleeker,</i> 
          have no <i>c</i>, and the standard authorities discard the use of that 
          letter in such words. The signature to the will below, is written by 
          the testator correctly on &nbsp; [412] &nbsp; the original instrument, 
          which is still preserved, and the orthography throughout is <i>Halenbeek</i>. 
          But the signatures of his sons are various as follows: Daniel Haalen 
          Beeck, Garett Hallen Beek, James [Jacob] Hallen Bake, Barnardus Halenbake. 
          The street, however, is usually written and printed Hallenbake. It was 
          laid out by the testator sixty feet wide, as though he expected that 
          street to be a more important avenue than the one now known as Pearl 
          street, which was forty-five feet in width, and afterwards took the 
          name of Washington strteet when Gen. Washington visited the city, from 
          the circumstance of his walking up that street with Gen. Schuyler, from 
          the residence of the latter, to dine with <a href="../bios/vr/jevr5085.html">Jeremiah 
          Van Rensselaer</a> in North Pearl street. 
          <p>
        <dd>In 1838, Abram Koonz, and others petitioned the common council to 
          have the street paved from Hudson to Lydius street. Very few of the 
          dwellers on that street now, can have an idea of its aspect at that 
          time. Mr. Koonz had built the house now standing on the northeast corner 
          of Hamilton and Grand streets in 1835, which stood alone like an outpost 
          upon the wester verge of the city. 
          <p>
        <dd>Here follows the will of Hendrik Halenbeek, showing how he disposed 
          of his property, and provided for the maintenance of the family burial 
          place.

          <br>
          <p> &nbsp; [413] &nbsp; I have been unable to locate the east and west 
            lines of this bouwery; but there is a deed recorded in the county 
            clerk's office, in book D, in which Hendrik Van Rensselaer in 1695, 
            conveyed to Isaac Casperse all that lot of ground with a parcel of 
            floodland lying near Albany, abutting to ye south on ye creek commonly 
            called Beaver kil, to the west surrounded with the woods, to the north 
            with ye hills and ye plain lying in the common, and to the east with 
            the swamp, containing in breadth on ye southside 50 rods on ye north 
            36 rods, and in length 160 rods, for L 81 current money. These boundaries 
            are so indefinite, they could not be very easily traced now, but such 
            a plot of ground would inclose 24.25 acres. But there is a written 
            agreement signed by a majority of the heirs, dated 27 Nov., 1766, 
            the year in which Hendrik died, in which they agree to a division 
            of a portion of the farm, which was mapped out into eight lots on 
            each side of what is now South Pearl Street, between Hamilton and 
            Lydius, "28 rods 5 feet Rynland measure," which is supposed to extend 
            from Grand to Rose street. In 1788, another division was made into 
            8 parcels, of the ground included between Hamilton and Plain streets, 
            and from Grand to Pearl, which map included the burial ground, showing 
            that the farm extended north as far as Plain street. Near the corner 
            of Plain street was a house built and occupied by Hendrik, and long 
            after [414] wards the residence of <a href="../bios/h/anthallenbeck5247.html">Anthony</a> 
            and his family, which was taken down a few years ago, and the building 
            of Merrifield and Wooster built upon it. 
          <p>A memorandum has been preserved, signed by Isaac Vrooman, dated July 
            13, 1767, whick appears to have been prepared with a view to disputing 
            the title of Hendrik to the estate, who seems to have claimed it as 
            heir-at-law, although the will of Isaac his father intended that the 
            property he left should be equally divided among his children, and 
            in his will devised his eldest son Jacob twenty shillings to bar his 
            claim as heir-at-law; but Jacob dying before the will was proved, 
            Hendrick being then the oldest son, undoubtedly contended that he 
            was not barred by the will, or had other claims which are indicated 
            in the following stray leaf found among the family papers. 
          <p>
        <dd>"1711, the said Isack Casperse deceased and then his Eldest Son Jacob 
          Dyde Nine months after his Father, then Hendrick Halenbake being the 
          Eldest and about sixteen years of his Eadge and then he worked and took 
          care of the famyly till he was twenty-seven years of adge and then he 
          marryd and after that the said Hendrick Halenbake paid a Bond of 40 
          pounds with sixteen years Interest to Cornales Scaalynse, then after 
          he paid another Bond of 30 pounds with four years interest to Warner 
          Van Eavery and then he give both the Bonds to his mother to take care 
          of for him, and likewise they have shared and divided all the house 
          and furniture without giving notice to the said Hendrick Halenbake which 
          was Eare at law." 
          <p>The memorandum referred to puts a different construction upon the 
            matter, and throws a little light upon the family relations, as follows: 
            <br>
        <dd>"1708, Nov. 17, Isaac Casparse Halenbeek made his will, and died in 
          the month of January, 1709, without issue. The widow Dorothy Halenbeek 
          leased the estate to the second son Hendrik, and died on or about the 
          4th Feb., 1744. <br>
        <dd>"1744, on or about the 15th June, all the heirs of Isaac Casparse 
          Halenbeek went to Hendrick Halenbeek, and demanded their shares and 
          patrimonies out of their father's estate, and nominated two indifferent 
          men to apprise the estate, which Hendrik altogether refused, and said 
          that they should have nothing but what they got by the hands of the 
          lawyers, in the presence of Lambert Radley and Helmus Rykman. Whereupon 
          all the heirs impowered they brother Gerret Halenbeek and their brother-in-law 
          Wouter Vrooman, and at the same time the was was peoclaimed in Albany, 
          and soon great disturbance from the Enemy followed, and soon after conclusion 
          of the war Gerret Halenbeek died, and Wouter Vrooman being an antient 
          man, did not chuse to proced therein, and also died the 26th Oct., 1756; 
          and in the meantime Maria Halenbeek, wife of Wouter Vrooman, died on 
          or about the 19th Jan., 1748, <br>
