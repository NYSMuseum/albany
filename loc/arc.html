It is highly recommended as it truly does unlock the many mysteries of the venerable old park that is still a working cemetery. Over the years (and shamelessly on many occasions), friends, family, and associates have accompanied me there for a range of reasons - all of which had the common denominator of being a good and useful time. Or, as I am too fond of saying, "hours of fun!" I am not alone in this fascination as a simple <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22albany+rural+cemetery%22&start=70">Google search</a> will reveal that  the Albany Rural Cemetery means many many things to a wide range of people!</font size>

<p><b>W</b>ith the first burial there not until 1845, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Rural_Cemetery">Albany Rural Cemetery</a> is not the burial grounds for the <a href="../criteria.html">people</a> who founded and built the city of Albany during the 17th and 18th centuries. We have made their passing and interments the subject of a theme essay entitled <i><a href="../dead.html">Burying the Dead in Early Albany</a>.</i> Paul's comprehensive guide brings many of their stories up to date.

<p>However, gravestones and "remains" of some of the people of colonial Albany have made their ways to Albany Rural from the 1840s until just recently while present day or "new" interments continue to take place. My grandparents were buried there during the early 1960s and a drive through the rural avenues and narrow lanes almost never fails to reveal a recent or in-progress burial. At the same time, after having logged hundreds of hours there since the 1960s, I am certain that today's outdoor historical site represents a prime <a href="../victorian.html">victorianizing</a> experience. Any time there cannot help but transport one back to the nineteenth century. Grab a copy of <i>These Exalted Acres</i> (and/or your smart phone) and head to Menands whenever the mood strikes.

<p>Although I hope to refrain from just repeating the narrative history of Albany Rural, this page is a work <a href="../inprog.html">in-progress</a> and will continue to provide interpretive thoughts on the life (and hopefully not the death) of Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
