<p>This map was the first to list all Albany <a href="../streets.html">streets</a> 
          by name. With the First Federal <a href="../census1790.html#first">Census 
          of 1790</a>, we can focus on the lives of these "State Street People!" 
          At the same time, a <a href="edownstate.html">contemporary view</a> 
          from the steps of St. Peter's church permits access into the heart of 
          the Albany community.</p>  

<p>By that time, the <a href="../im/im1770.html">fort</a> which stood in the middle 
          of the street had been dismantled permitting State Street to run from 
          the river, up the hill, to Eagle street and then branch into Lion (Washington 
          Avenue) and Deer (upper State) Streets.</p>

<p>Two important community landmarks sat in the middle of the street. The large and assertive <a href="../drc.html">Dutch Reformed Church</a> at the intersection with Market Street had been at that location for 140 years and still was Albany's premier social institution. Heading up the hill, <a href="../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal (formerly Anglican) church had served Albany's English speaking congregation since 1714. Within a decade, both edifaces would be removed and relocated to other parts of the city. However, it would be many decades before the median of this wide boulevard  was cleared enough to permit easy travel up the hill.</p>

<p><a name=lower></a>Chief among the remaining landmarks was the <a href="elmtreecorner.html">Elm Tree Corner</a> (northwest corner of State and Pearl) where a young Philip Livingston was said to have planted a tree that lived for more than 150 
        years. State Street was the home of many of the community's most august 
        personages. Reclusive <a href="../bios/l/blydius4620.html">Baltus Lydius</a> 
        sitting in the window of the old family home; the old <a href="schuylerhouse.html#house">Schuyler 
        House</a> that became a landmark tavern; John Stevenson's <a href="../bios/s/jostevenson2244.html#home">modern 
        mansion</a> where Governor Van Buren later lived. The <a href="../bios/y/ryates.html#home">home</a> 
        of chief justice Robert Yates; the old Wendell house; Philip S. Van Rensselaer's 
        <a href="../bios/vr/psvr5106.html#mansion">mansion</a>; and many others</p>

<p>The two blocks between Pearl and Market were lined with the homes of Albany's business elite. On the north side, the first bank was opened at State Street in 1803. Its facade is still visible today. Several <a href="estatemkt.html">homes</a> including that of State legislator <a href="../bios/g/leogans4666.html">Leonard Gansevoort</a> were destroyed in the great <a href="../fire.html">fire</a> of 1793! On the south side, the block was divided by <a href="../streets.html#green">Green Street</a> - a long narrow path past the stage office to "Cheapside" and the pastures beyond. By 1790, future Lieutenant Governor <a href="../bios/t/jotayler.html">John Tayler</a> had taken up residence at 50 State Street.</p>

        <p>Between Market Street and the river, the lower two blocks of State Street were 
          lined with <a href="../loc/experiment.html">small shops and storehouses</a>. 
        <p>Basic layout and lot sizes are discernible on an <a href="../map/bogertmap.html">engraving</a> 
          of a map originally made by the city surveyor in 1792. Subsequent city 
          cartography as well as recent urban archeology helps us reconstruct 
          living patterns at the beginning of Albany's first great period of growth.</p>

<p>State Street was the subject of an <a href="http://www.albany.edu/museum/exhibitions/statestreet.html">exhibition</a> opened in September 2002 at the University at Albany Art Gallery!</p>

          New <b>Prison</b> shown on the map and in an inset on the full <a href="../images/jpg/map1794.jpg">engraving</a> 
          of the map of Albany made by <a href="../bios/d/sdewitt.html">Simeon 
          De Witt</a>. The building was authorized by a New York State legislative 
          enactment in 1791. However, it was not completed until 1804 or 1809 
          and replaced the <a href="jail.html">jail</a> in the old <a href="cityhall.html">city hall</a>. 
          The building (roughly 84'x 116') was bounded by State and Eagle Streets 
          and Maiden Lane. In 1831, 56 inmates were confined there. It was sold 
          at auction in 1832. The second "new jail," located  on Eagle and Howard Streets,  was opened 
          in 1834. See <a href="../sources.html#ht"><i>Bicentennial History</i></a>, 
          348-49.</p>
