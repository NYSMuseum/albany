          <p><a href="../im/imemarket.html"><img SRC="../images/jpg/emkthse.jpg" ALT="detail showing the Market House" HSPACE=8 VSPACE=4 BORDER=1 width=300 align=left></a>This 
            detail is from a <a href="../im/imemarket.html">larger painting</a> 
            made during the 1850s by <a href="../victorian.html#eights">James 
            Eights</a>. It shows the Market House as it may have appeared in the 
            early 1800s.</P>

          <p>Erected in the middle of <a href="../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> 
            about <a href="../map/map1765.html">1765</a> when it was first shown on a British army map, it served as a merchant's 
            exchange and as the official station for weighing and valuing farm 
            produce and country products. It quickly became the center of Albany 
            <a href="../econ/comec.html">business</a> life as regional farmers bartered with established merchants 
            and newly arrived entrepreneurers as well. The <a href="../doc/laws.html#markets"><i>Laws</i></a> of Albany published in 1773 regulated the sale of meat and confined those transactions to the public market house. During <a href="../lastdays.html">colonial days</a>, most Albany merchants strove to live within sight of the Market House.</p>

          <p><a href="../im/im1794.html#bottom"><img src="../images/jpg/th/1794th.jpg" width=200 height=100 align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Market House shown on 1794 map"></a>After the Revolution, the Albany business district spread out along the <a href="../loc/experiment.html">riverfront</a>, 
            up the State Street Hill, and to other parts of the city as well. 

<p>With the <a href="../albanycounty.html">regional population</a> booming, 
            the Market House was no longer adequate to serve the business needs 
            of an emerging North American entrepot. The old markethouse building 
            fell into disuse and was removed from the middle of a busy thoroughfare 
            in 1805.

<p>The public markets then were relocated around an expanding city. Today, a rotating "Farmer's Market" - held around the city on different days reminds us of the Market House of old Albany.</p>
