The building on that site may have been erected earlier. Later it was owned by <a href="../bios/g/jaglen4927.html">Jacob Glen</a>. Following his death in 1746, his <a href="../bios/c/elcuyler400.html">widow</a> lived there thru the <a href="../or/or-bh.html">era</a> of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>The building, which faced south on <a href="../streets.html#steuben">Steuben Street</a> and had a high stone cellar, survived into the nineteenth century.
