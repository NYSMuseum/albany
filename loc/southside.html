"Southside" occasionally was referenced in documents and records during the decades prior to the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">Revolution</a>.  

<p>Centering roughly on the intersection of <a href="../streets.html#beaver">Beaver</a> and <a href="../streets.html#green">Green</a> Streets - and extending for a couple blocks in all directions, by the early <a href="../lists/list1709tl.html#ss">1700s</a>, "Southside" was the home to a number of families of the members of the Albany <a href="../garrison.html">garrison</a>. These former soldiers formed the core of Albany's Anglo-<a href="../bios/irish.html">Irish</a> enclave for the next hundred years. In time, their descendants took their <a href="../econ/comec.html#pec">places</a> as craftsmen, tradesmen, and transporters. A few moved up to enter the <a href="../econ/comec.html#mer">business</a> class. Later, a number of inns and taverns provided comfort for Albany's growing English-speaking population. <a href="../bios/c/ricartwright6508.html">Richard Cartwright</a>'s "King's Arms" on Beaver Street was a centerpiece of this neighborhood and of <a href="../bios/anglo.html">Eng</a>lish-speaking culture in Albany for several decades.  

<p>More generally, Southside was bounded by <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">Pearl Street</a> on the west, the stockade line on the south, Court Street, and the houses south of State Street. It represented a second stage of <a href="../homes.html#2">building</a> (beyond the initial core centered by on the old <a href="../drc.html">D</a>utch church in the street at State and Market) in the development of colonial Albany. The Dutch church <a href="../dead.html#drc">cemetery</a> located along Hudson Street near the early stockade was a prominent landmark until after the Revolution.

<p>To the south of Southside was an extensive tract of land owned by the <a href="../bios/h/hallenbeck.html">Hallenbeck family</a>. It extended to the <a href="beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a> and was developed more intensively following the death of "yeoman" <a href="../bios/h/hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick Hallenbeck</a> in 1766. The <a href="southend.html">South End</a> (formerly the Pastures) was the predominately nineteenth century neighborhood located to the south of Southside.

<p>By the 1750s, the settled area mostly along and closer to <a href="../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> was the home of an enclave of <a href="../trades/weaver.html#1756">weavers</a>. 

<p>By the 1770s, the newly published <a href="../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> referred to landmarks in the area being "in Cheapside."

<p>By 1800, the western edge of this neighborhood was more well settled and is articulated in an <a href="../im\imspearldiag.html">image map</a>.</p>

<P><a name=sources></a><b>Sources:</b> We find little documentable evidence for the use of this term during the seventeenth and most of the eighteenth century. However, it has some utility in describing the working class area of the city south and west of State and Court <a href="../streets.html">streets</a>.</p>
