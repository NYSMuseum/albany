<p><a href="#sources">T</a>raditionally, but not without much discussion, the "South End" is a term used to describe the flood plain pasture land located south of <a href="../streets.html#lydius">Lydius Street</a>, east of <a href="../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl</a>, and bordered by the original southern <a href="../citylimits.html">boundary</a> of Albany. "The Pastures" was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pftCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=%22commonly+called+or+known+by+the+name+of+the+pasture%22&source=bl&ots=ewkn2slc1T&sig=5LD6aOcijM5rao5HyiD9IBWY05Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjC6tb6zKjOAhWj3YMKHeLXCUcQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=%22commonly%20called%20or%20known%20by%20the%20name%20of%20the%20pasture%22&f=false">identified</a> as a community landmark in the Albany <a href="../charter.html">municipal charter</a> granted in 1686. Shortly thereafter, that acreage was reserved to the 
Dutch church. As early as <a href="../im/imroemer.html">1698</a>, it was located on a city map. From then on, it frequently was referred to as "the Pastures." The entire plot was deeded from the <a href="../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> to the <a href="../corporation.html">city</a> in 1815. Today, the term "South End" is much more <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=%22south+end%22+albany&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g1&gws_rd=ssl">encompassing</a> - covering both sides of South Pearl Street (maybe almost all the way west to Delaware Avenue).

<p>The purpose of this exposition is to describe the southeastern corner of the original city of Albany in its pre-industrial context - namely the settlement and development of the area south of Lydius Street (today's Madison Avenue) and below (east of ) South Pearl Street.  We offer a <a href="../pgms/css.html">public program</a> that focuses on a particular aspect of the initial settlement of the South End!

<p>The detail shown here is from a very faint copy of <a href="../guide/histres.html#engineer">engineer's map</a> made by <a href="../bios/va/evvallen.html">Evert Van Allen</a> in 1818. You might click on key landmarks including Schuyler Mansion, the South Pearl Street residence of Captain Samuel Schuyler, Lydius Street, the Beaverkill, the ferry, the tip of Castle Island, and South Pearl Street. The <a href="../map/mapdewitt.html">maps</a> made by Surveyor General and later South End resident <a href="../bios/d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a> during the 1790s also are of interest but far less detailed. 

<p><a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> erected an elegant and grand <a hrefschuylermansion.html">mansion</a> on the side of the hill at the end of the last French & Indian War. At that time, it overlooked an unbroken expanse of pasture land that belonged to the Albany Dutch Reformed Church. The map on the right shows the so-called "Pastures" with each lot or parcel numbered and available for sale.

<p>Already in informal use as a pastureland, "the pastures" were deeded to the <a href="../corporation.html">city of Albany</a> in its municipal <a href="../charter.html">charter</a> in 1686. The following year, <a href="../bios/d/godellius.html">Domine Dellius</a> negotiated the transfer of fifty acres of the land to the church in payment for a debt. 

<p>At some tine during the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">era</a> of the American Revolution, newcomer <a href="../bios/c/wmcharles7590.html">William Charles</a> was butchering meat where the path  to Schuyler Mansion cut across the Beaverkill in the vicinity of today's Arch Street. By the end of the century, his son <a href="../bios/c/geocharles7588.html">George Charles</a> was operating a "tannery" in that <a href="../im/imspearldiag.html">locale</a>. 

<p>The first ward assessment roll of <a href="../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, showed a number of very marginal residences located east of what became South Pearl Street. <a href="../census1800.html#15">Two</a> distinct <a href="../census1800.html#17">sections</a> of the first ward census for 1800 showing concentrations of "<a href="../art/art-jls.html#fpc">all other free persons</a>" probably were living in this area as well.

<p>It appears that the actual settlement of this area began with the distribution of the <a href="../wills/willphschuyler1750.html">estate</a> of General Schuyler following his death in 1804. 

 <p>By 1810, Afro-Albanian South End pioneer Captain <a href="../bios/s/sschuyler8492.html">Samuel Schuyler</a> had settled on South Pearl Street and was acquiring adjoining lots. From then to the present, South Pearl Street was developed as the "main street" of the South End. Despite being at the mercy of the annual spring flooding of the Hudson, the area became densely inhabited by actual residents and utilized in a range of industrial applications.

<p>This offering will be expanded to cover the early years of the South End in better detail. However, <a href="#sources">much</a> has been written and posted on this neighborhood from then to today as it served as a first home to several waves of <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> groups.</p>

<p><a name=sources></a><b>Sources:</b> The reigning primer on the South End was the major ambition of the late <a href="../bios/staff/vbowers.html">Virginia Bowers</a>. She chose to focus on the <a href="../bios/ger.html">German</a> immigrant population of the neighborhood. After that, Internet sources abound: Start with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighborhoods_of_Albany,_New_York#South_End">Wikipedia</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=%22south+end%22+albany&aq=f&oq=&aqi=g1">Google it</a>.

        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like the work of Virginia Bowers, each succeeding 
        wave of <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> has considered the "South 
        End" as its own. With a number of ethnicity-oriented churches there historically, 
        those assertions have validity - but not exclusively. See: <a href="">The 
        Neighborhood that Disappeared</a>. <br>
