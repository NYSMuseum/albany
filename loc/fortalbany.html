<p><b>B</b>y the <a href="../timeline.html">time</a> of the English takeover, old <a href="fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> had been abandoned. A decade later, it was a shell of its former self. Built by the lowland Dutch as a trading post, its riverside location made it susceptible to springtime flooding and entirely unsuitable for its new purposes under the English.</p>

<p>Initially, the Duke of York sought to maintain a <a href="#detachment">detachment of soldiers</a> in Albany to uphold his rights and generally keep the peace. They may have manned a <a href="../map/map1676.html">guardhouse</a> located at the intersection of today's State and Pearl Streets. At this point, we have recovered only anecdotal information about these early English soldiers.</p>

<p><a href="#lt"><img src="../images/jpg/ltfort250.jpg" align=left border=1 hspace=4 width=200 alt="the fort in 1686"></a>After 1676, the Duke's government took a decidedly more determined approach to governing the province of New York. In Dutch-speaking Albany, that determination took the form of a new fort built above the <a href="../im/im1686.html">town</a> - near the top of             the <a href="../streets.html#state">main street</a> leading from the river and connecting with the wilderness road that <a href="kingshighway.html">ran 
            to Schenectady</a>. Not a trading post, the new Albany fort would 
            protect the settlers of the region while reminding them that now they 
            were subjects of an English overlord. By the 1680s, the fort had two 
            small buildings and was enclosed by a wooden stockade.</p>

<p>When New York became a royal colony in 1684, the British colonial (royal)  government took charge of the fort. Beginning during the 1690s, provincial records begin to document an increase in resources applied to improving the fort and provisioning its <a href="../garrison.html">garrison</a>.</p>

          <p><a name=plan></a><a href="#millerplan"><img src="../images/jpg/ftmillerplan300.jpg" border=1 width=250 align=right alt="Miller's sketch of the fort - 1695" hspace=2 vspace=0></a>In 
            1692, the Reverend <a href="../bios/m/jmiller.html">John Miller</a> was 
            sent to America to serve English-speaking populations in New York, 
            at Albany, and on the frontier - where he was empowered to minister 
            to the Indians. He also was the fort's most communicative historian. 
            His published report included a <a href="../im/immiller.html">map 
            of Albany</a> and of the fort and a description of conditions there. 
            A few years later, the military engineer Wolfgang Roemer drafted another 
            <a href="../im/imroemer.html">map</a> of the community that showed 
            natural features, marked iconographic elements, and included more 
            detailed depictions of the fort.</p>

<p>After 1713, the frontier line moved west from Albany and north almost into the Champlain Valley. In the years that followed, provincial resources were more likely to be allocated to new "British" outposts at Oswego and along the northern frontier. Also, after 1720, references to the Albany fort and its garrison become less frequent. During the <a href="../peace.html">three decades of peace</a>, the garrison at Albany seems to have declined as only a handful of British emigres became part of the Albany community - a marked contrast to the period 1680-1710 when <a href="../garrison.html#research">dozens of soldiers</a> married and settled in Albany.</p>

          <p><a name=eights>The fort at Albany was re-built during this time as part of 
            a general province-wide upgrade of fortifications. Assembly allocations 
            supported construction of stone walls, more substantial internal buildings, 
            and improved emplacements around the stockade perimeter as well. <img src="../images/jpg/efortalbany300.jpg" border=1 align=left width=290 hspace=8 vspace=4 alt="the fort at mid-century"> 
            However, the actual extent of the fort's <a href="../art/kalm.html#fort">development</a> 
            is unclear as our understanding of it is guided chiefly by <a href="#fort">cartographic 
            proposals</a> and subsequent artwork based on those plans. The watercolor 
            by <a href="../victorian.html#eights">James Eights</a> shown on the left 
            represents his mid-nineteenth century visualization of the fort taken 
            directly from a map made a hundred years earlier. The fort reached 
            its high point of grandeur</a> during the <a href="../7yw.html">Seven 
            Year's War</a> when the British army was encamped in Albany and its 
            environs. During that occupation, the British further fortified the 
            Albany structure and added external barracks, magazines, storehouses, 
            and a hospital.</p>

            <p>With the end of the "French and Indian Wars" and the widthdrawl of 
              the British troops, the Albany fort was without its intended occupants. 
              In <a href="../map/map1765.html">1765</a>, the abandoned fort, hospital, 
              barracks, and other structures were purchased by the Albany corporation. 
              No longer maintained by the provincial government, the fort fell 
              into rapid disrepair. A <a href="../im/im1770.html">map of 
              Albany</a> dated 1770 shows the fort in an outlined form that testifies 
              to its dilapitated condition. During the 1760s, local people had 
              salvaged stone, wood, and metal parts from the fort - despite the 
              admonitions of the <a href="../corporation.html">common council</a> 
              against such actions.</p>

            <p>By the time hostilities broke out in 1775, few Americans had illusions about 
              the fort's utility. Nevertheless, it was used as a jail for <a href="../friends.html">Tories</a> 
              and for storage of non critical supplies. With the end of the war 
              in 1783, the fort - now in ruins, became a definite obstacle to 
              transportation and to development as the city began to expand north 
              - up the hill. The fort was not shown on the <a href="../map/mapdewitt.html">municipal 
              maps</a> produced during the 1790s.</p>

<p>A symbol of British rule - more so for posterity than for the people of colonial Albany who appeared unintimidated and viewed it as an opportunity for profits, the fort at Albany has been part of the traditional iconography of the colonial city.</p>

<p><font size=-1><a name=detachment></a>Captain John Manning commanded the initial <a href="../garrison.html"><b>garrison</b></a>. We have compiled some information on officers and men stationed there prior to the 1690s. Admittedly, our work has focused on the soldiers who became city residents. At this point, no comprehensive records for the fort or its garrison have been recovered.

This visualization is based on the drawings of the fort accompanying the Miller and <a href="../im/imroemer.html">Roemer</a> maps. Overview diagream in the collection of Stefan Bielinski.

<p><a name=millerplan></a>This <b>diagram of the fort</b> was printed in <i>New York Considered 
          and Improved, 1695</i> by <a href="../bios/m/jmiller.html">John Miller</a> 
          ("published from the original MS. in the British Museum"). The manuscript 
          was edited by Victor Hugo Paltsits, and published by The Burrows Brothers 
          Company of Cleveland in 1903. With its descriptive text, analyses, and 
          annotated maps and diagrams, that work represents a major historical 
          and ethnographic resource for the history of New York during the 1690s.

              were made by army engineers to show <u>proposed</u> improvements

              The most comprehensible narrative on the fort is found in Paul R. 
              Huey, <i>Aspects of Continuity and Change in Colonial Dutch Material 
              Culture at Fort Orange, 1624-1664</i> (Ph.D. dissertation, University 
              of Pennsylvania, 1988). A set of British engineers' maps of colonial 
              Albany in the so-called "Crown Collection" of maps in the British 
              Public Records Office have been published as <i>A Set of Plans and
