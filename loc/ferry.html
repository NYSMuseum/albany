        <p><b>F</b>rom the beginning of settlement on the site of Albany, people 
          and cargoes were transported across the Hudson to and from Albany on 
          small watercraft generally known as "ferries." This feature begins to 
          organize our exposition on the subject. Please be patient as it is very 
          much <a href="../inprog.html"> In-progress </a> 
        <p><a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/"><img src="../images/jpg/ltferry.jpg" align=left border=1 width=300 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Fort Orange Ferry - 1643"></a> 
          This image depicts the beginnings of cross-river ferry traffic between 
          the first settlements at and around the site of Albany. 
        <p>Fortunately, the <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com">historical 
          artist</a> continues to dream creatively about watercraft around what 
          became Albany. Thus, he has produced a number of imaginative and useful 
          illustrations that we will employ to illuminate this topic. 
        <p>By the time of Albany's <a href="../charter.html">chartering</a>, the 
          ferry seems to have run from the foot of Maiden Lane to an unspecified 
          location in Greenbush. <a href="../im/im1686.html"><img src="../images/jpg/lt1686ferry.jpg" align=right width=150 hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 alt="Maiden Lane ferry landing 1686"></a> 
          At some time after that, the city corporation began to lease/license 
          the right to run the ferry. In 1751, <a href="../bios/b/bebradt4335.html">Bernardus 
          Bradt</a> and <a href="../bios/t/jotbroeck52.html">Johannes Ten Broeck</a> 
          purchased the ferry license. By the <a href="../im/im1770.html">1770s</a>, 
          a south Ferry ran from below and to the north of Philip Schuyler's <a href="schuylermansion.html">new 
          home</a> (roughly the site of the riverbank and South Ferry Street) 
          to perhaps Crailo directly across the Hudson. 
        <p>In March 1768, the Albany Common Council renewed the Ordinance for 
          regulating the ferry with the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=%22ferry%22&source=bl&ots=wyhLdRvcgt&sig=INFqtZGOARCBDwkv8RgUgreGgvs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-puLops3JAhXDGx4KHfd-CvgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22ferry%22&f=false">following 
          additions</a>: "And be it further ordained by the authority aforesaid 
          that the Person or Persons who buy the Ferry is strictly enjoyed to 
          follow the ordinance made for the regulation of the same, and upon Complaint 
          made to the Mayor, Recorder, Aldermen and Commonalty of the non performance 
          of the ferryman of the Rules by this ordinance laid down, that it shall 
          and may be Lawfull to remove the said Ferryman, he paying for the time 
          he has had the Ferry, and in such case or default to dispose of the 
          same to another person." At that time, the Greenbush ferry was under 
          contract to <a href="../bios/b/jobromley5959.html">John Bromley</a> 
          and <a href="../bios/c/jocort7709.html">John Courtney</a>. 
        <p>In 1770, <a href="../bios/t/catbroeck14.html">Widow Hansen</a> and 
          <a href="../bios/l/thlottridge414.html">Thomas Lottridge</a> were granted 
          the license to operate the ferry. Beginning in 1781, recently retired 
          army officer <a href="../bios/h/dihansen4970.html">Dirck Hansen</a> 
          (son of the aged widow) held the ferry license. Probably, Lottridge 
          lived in the ferry house on the Albany side while Hansen resided in 
          Greenbush. 
        <p>In 1773, the then newly published <a href="../doc/laws.html#ferry"><i>Laws 
          and Ordinances</i></a> defined and more closely proscribed and regulated 
          ferry use. Subsequent <a href="../im/im1794.html#bottom">maps</a> called 
          it the "Green Bush Ferry" and were showing the <a href="../map/mapdewitt.html#map1bottom">ferry 
          house</a>. 
        <p>Beginning in 1785, the city council <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false+benthuysen">contracted</a> 
          with <a href="../bios/vb/bavbt5348.html">Baltus Van Benthuysen</a> to 
          build a new ferry house. Specifications to Van Benthuysen were: a 50x40x10 
          ft. first floor and a second floor 7 feet high. Eight rooms per floor 
          and four chimneys. 
        <p>In September 1789, the city council agreed to a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=caMpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=%22ferry+house%22+slingerlandt&source=bl&ots=AcG-7xcsuR&sig=5iqGZLVRMHIZADJIs6mnIxSUnR0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result">proposal</a> 
          authorizing acquisition of the land needed to open Ferry Street from 
          the Gerry House to Washington (South Pearl) Street. 
        <p>By <a href="../art/art-jls.html">1815</a>, the city directory identified 
          two ferrymen - both of whom were Free Persons of Color. Henry Otefield 
          lived near the south ferry at 76 Church Street. Douw Rocket lived on 
          Lumber Street (north side). Musician <a href="../bios/t/jotop7750.html">John 
          Top</a> lived at the Ferry and ferryman John Hugener lived at 5 Ferry 
          Street - although he was not identified as Afro-Albanian. 
        <p><a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/"><img src="../images/jpg/ltferry1875.jpg" align=right vspace=4 hspace=4 width= 315 alt="last ferry of the day - 1875" border=1></a> 
          During the nineteenth century, a north ferry ran from the foot of North 
          Ferry Street (near the Van Rensselaer <a href="../na/vrmh.html">Manor 
          House</a>) across the Hudson to Bath (Rensselaer). 
        <p>Because so many different watercraft crossed the river during the nineteenth 
          century, we are unsure when or if the city no longer held to its right 
          to license the ferry. However, the ferries continued as the only ways 
          to cross the Hudson until <a href="http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/albbrdg.Html">bridges</a> 
          spanned the river at Albany beginning during the 1860s. Maps from that 
          period show three formal ferries connecting Albany to the east side 
          of the Hudson. </p>
