<font face="arial">
<p>By definition, the term "early Albany jail" refers to the places where prisoners were kept before the building of the "<a href="../loc/statestreet.html#jail">new Jail</a>" sometime after the War for Independence.

<p>In the beginning, our exposition on the subject is compiled from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=lang_en&q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+jail+albany">references</a> to the jail that currently appear on this website. 
    <p>First, we have found no law, ordinance, or any set of rules governing criminal 
      justice in the early Albany <a href="../guide/histres.html#cr">record</a>. From the beginning of community life 
      on the site of Albany, most offenders were not punished by imprisonment. 
      We know from court and city records and from the "<a href="..//doc/laws.html">laws 
      and ordinances</a>" published in 1773 that they were fined and sometimes 
      chastized by the public whipper. 
    <p>Until the end of the eighteenth century, the so-called jail (or gaol) seems 
      to have been in the <a href="../loc/cityhall.html#sh">city hall</a>. The 
      first city hall was a conventional building located on <a href="../loc/court.html">Court 
      Street</a>. It served as the municipal government, the court, clerk's office, 
      and as the jail from before the establishment of city government in <a href="../charter.html">1686</a> 
      until the new city hall was erected during the 1740s. 
    <p>The jail was operated by the 
    <a href="../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> (who served both city and county). A jailer 
    answered to the sheriff and presumably was paid from the fees collected by 
    the sheriff.
    <p>Working around the absence of actual sheriffs' 
      or jail records, during the second half of the eighteenth century civil 
      and criminal prisoners were held in the jail. During the <a href="../7yw.html">Seven 
      Years War</a>, some military prisoners were held there. During the War for 
      Independence, some military and Tory prisoners were held at the then <a href="fortalbany.html">old 
      fort</a>. Sick and disabled prisoners were held at the <a href="hospital.html">hospital</a>. 
      In 1776, skipper and alderman <a href="../bios/m/gymarselis720.html">Gysbert 
      G. Marselis</a> was charged with repairing the jail and supervising the 
      jailors. 

<p>During the war years, a large number of diversely deviant individuals were confined in the Albany jails in all locations. Among them was <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:5TQL7_FMdzAJ:www.shakerheritage.org/A%2520Short%2520History%2520of%2520Watervliet.doc+jail+albany+history+%22new+york%22&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=116&gl=us&lr=lang_en">Ann Lee</a> - founder of the Shakers who tried to dissuade other prisoners from taking up arms.

<p>By the end of the war for Independence, it was clear that the now booming city of Albany and its growing hinterland were in need of more substantial 
      and separate accommodations for law breakers. 

<p>In 1785, carpenter and nearby Albany resident <a href="../bios/vw/hevwie6576.html">Hendrick Van Wie</a> was identified as the jailor.
 
<p><a href="#1790s"><img src="../images/jpg/prison1794.jpg" width=100 border=1 hspace=8 vspace=4 align=right alt="new prison - 1794"></a>By 
      the 1790s, a new jail or "prison" had been build on upper State Street <a href="statestreet.html">and</a> 
      Maiden Lane near the new <a href="publicsq.html">Public Square</a>. In 1800, 
      the <a href="../census1800.html#jail">census</a> returns for the second 
      ward showed that <a href="../bios/l/jalightbody.html">James Lightbody</a> was the jailor and eighteen men, a woman, 
      and four slaves were incarcerated. Although its construction was authorized 
      by the State legislature, it is unclear whether, at that time, the jail 
      was under <a href="../corporation.html">municipal</a> or State jurisdiction.

<p>After 1800, New Englander <a href="../bios/h/nahawley.html">Nathan Hawley</a> relocated from Rensselaersville to serve as jailor. His family was said to have lived in rooms in the rear of the new jail. His <a href="../bios/s/elsears.html">wife</a> ran an inn there at 71 Maiden Lane. Hawley died in 1810.	  
	   
    <p>In 1834, a more permanent municipal jail was built along what became Eagle 
      Street at the Howard Street. 
    <p>The Albany penitentiary was built largely by prisoner labor and opened 
      as a prison in 1846. 
    <p>Today, the <a href="http://www.albanycountysheriff.com/correctionfacility.html">Albany 
      County Correctional Facility</a> (built in 1931) is under the jurisdiction 
      of the sheriff's office and sits on land near the Albany Airport and the 
      site of the original Shaker settlement.</p>
