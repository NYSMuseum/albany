            <b>T</b>he "<a href="#origins">Ruttenkill</a>" is a traditional term 
            referring to one of the <a href="#streams">three major streams</a> 
            that flowed through colonial Albany and emptied into the Hudson River.</p>

<p>The Ruttenkill rises above today's Lark Street as several feeders flow together. It was a small stream - swelled by rains and spring runoff. It runs from west to east and between Hudson and State Streets. Above South Pearl Street, the Ruttenkill created a deeply eroded ravine that inhibited development of that part of the city until the nineteenth century. On the eastern end, its banks were features of many early property lines. Historic maps show bridges over the stream as it ran across Pearl and Court Streets. It emptied into the Hudson just south of the foot of State Street.</p>

          <p>The course of the Ruttenkill is referenced on most <a href="../pcalhindex.html#map">early 
            Albany maps</a>. It is <a href="../images/jpg/map1790600.jpg">shown 
            quite clearly</a> on the first of the city maps produced during the 
            1790s by <a href="../bios/d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a>. After 
            1820, it was piped and fill deposited on top of the pipes. Joel Munsell later <a href="../sources.html#aa">noted</a> that it flowed under today's <a href="../streets.html#norton">Norton Street</a> as the stream crossed it near the first <a href="../presbyterian.html">P</a>resbyterian church.Today, the stream is entirely underground running under many modern buildings and 
            the <a href="http://www.bluffton.edu/~sullivanm/empiresp/empiresp.html">Empire 
            State Plaza</a>.</p>

<p>In recent years, redevelopment of downtown Albany caused <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/arccrspnortonst.html">survey archeology</a> to be undertaken along the course of the lower Ruttenkill.</p>

<p><a name=origins></a>We are considering a number of possible origins and meanings for the term "Ruttenkill!"</p>

          <P><a name=streams></a>From north to south, these westflowing streams 
            were the Vossenkill (<a href="foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>), the 
            <a href="ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a>, and the <a href="beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. 
            The best historical description of these streams is found in Amasa 
            J. Parker, <i>Landmarks of Albany County</i> (Syracuse, 1897), part 
            1:282-83.</p>
