<p><a href="../map/mapdewitt.html#1790img"><img src="../images/jpg/nbg1790.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200 alt="detail from the De Witt map of 1790"></a><b>T</b>he only authentic (not <a href="../res/ts.html">TS</a>) historical reference to this location encountered thus far in the <a href="../cbr.html">community-based record</a> and our ongoing sweep of <a href="../res/irs.html">Internet-based resources</a> appears on an engraving of a city <a href="../map/mapdewitt.html">map</a> attributed to State Surveyor General <a href="../bios/d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a> and dated 1790.

<p>The same engraved map also shows the first <a href="../dead.html#municipal">municipal cemetery</a> located a few hundred feet to the south. That cemetery was divided by churches and included some family plots - but none for the city's <a href="../afroalbanians.html">Afro Albanian</a> minority that, at that time, numbered almost 600 individuals.</p>

<p>Although subsequent <a href="../pcalhindex.html#map">maps</a> on our <a href="../guide/histres.html#cart">cartographic radar</a> suggest that the plot was never "gridded-out" for development, the location was not marked as a burial place on any other historical cartography. Its location appears to have been on the edge of the ridge overlooking the <a href="foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> Ravine - a steep hillside then and now with the legendary <a href="../streets.html#road">Road Street</a> running along the southern base of the hill.</p>

<p>The Washington Park cemetery opened during the early 1800s and did include a plot reserved for so-called "Colored" people. Those graves were among the stones removed to Albany Rural Cemetery and re-set in a separate part of Albany Rural as the African Methodist Episcopal Church plot. In 1866, a <a href="https://archive.org/stream/proceedingsofcom00alba#page/86/mode/2up">listing</a> was made of the remains relocated from Washington Park.</p>
