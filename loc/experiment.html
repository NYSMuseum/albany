<p>The <i><a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/shop/18th-Century/Return-of-the-Experiment/prod_32.html">Return 
        of the Experiment</a></i>, by <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/">L. 
        F. Tantillo</a>, 1994. Collection of Key Bank. Captained by Albany resident 
        <a href="../bios/d/stdean.html">Stewart Dean</a>, <i>the Experiment</i> 
        sailed from Albany to China in 1785 - the second American ship to visit 
        the Orient. This painting commemorates its return to Albany during the 
        summer of 1787. This 48 x 96 <a href="../tantillo.html">panorama</a> can 
        be seen by the public in the lobby of the Key Bank building (the bank's 
        northeast regional headquarters) at 66 South Pearl Street just outside 
        the walls of the original city stockade.
<p>The following narrative was composed by the <a href="../tantillo.html#tantillo">artist</a> and appearing in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Visions-New-York-State-Historical/dp/1885482051">published catalog</a> of an <a href="http://www.albany.edu/museum/wwwmuseum/tantillo/index.html">exhibition</a> of his historical works held at the <a href="http://www.albany.edu/museum/index.shtml">University Art Museum</a> in 1996:

<P><blockquote>It is impossible for an artist to accurately portray without existing visual material something as complex as a city of another era. In such cases I always build scale models. I
began this one by basing my layout on a 1770 map of Albany which clearly
indicated the location and arrangement of major structures. Utilizing my
earlier research I first built models of the well-known buildings which
included the Dutch Church and City Hall. They were followed by dozens of
houses, barns and outbuildings. I also modeled Experiment and other river
craft. Once I had a way to study the old city I started making sketches.
After much consideration and many color studies I decided to place the
viewer south of City Hall at about rooftop height looking north up the
Hudson River. This position placed Experiment in the lower right foreground
of the painting moving away from the viewer toward City Hall Dock. The
likelihood that Dean’s return to Albany looked anything like my painting
is small. For all we know he could have arrived in the middle of the night
or during a storm or even at a different time of year. I do believe, however,
that the Albany I painted is close to what existed at that time and that
if Captain Dean sailed up to City Hall Dock on a sunny late afternoon in
June of 1787 this is what we would have seen from our rooftop perch. After
working on this commissioned painting for one year it was finally completed
and installed in the lobby of the KeyCorp Building on South Pearl Street
in Albany.</blockquote>
