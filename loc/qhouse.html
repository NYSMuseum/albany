          The historic structure popularly known as the <a href="#sources">Quackenbush 
          House</a> is the oldest intact building still standing <a href="../citylimits.html">in</a> 
          the city of Albany! <a href="../res/ts.html">B</a>elieved to have been 
          built by a Pieter Quackenbush (probably <a href="../bios/q/piq2302.html">PWQ</a>) 
          during the 1730s, it is best known (at least in legend) as the home 
          of Revolutionary War officer <a href="../bios/q/heq2111.html">Hendrick 
          Quackenbush</a>.</p>

<p>This substantial building is perhaps typical of the city houses built by Albany's <a href="../econ/comec.html">business</a> leaders and was situated on a large block of land in old Albany's <a href="northend.html">North End</a>. It testifies to the success of its owners' enterprises which included brickmaking, distilling, <a href="../trades/tanner.html">tanning</a>, and shipping. Situated on the east side of North Market Street (today's 
Broadway) and located on the flood plain and along the road <a href="../loc/northend.html">north</a> out of Albany, it was described by a number of eighteenth century <a href="../res/visitors.html">observers</a>.</p>

<p>Located beyond the original boundaries of the city, the Quackenbush house was technically part of <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and then the town of <a href="../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. In 1812, Albany's boundary line was extended northward bringing the Quackenbush 
        house into the city of Albany.<a href="#color"><img src="../images/jpg/qhousenicoles.jpg" alt="Nicole's Bistro in the old Quackenbush House" align=right width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1></a> </P>

<p>During the twentieth century, the Quackenbush house was a gas station and restaurant. In 1954, it appears to have been known as "Bill's Tavern & Restaurant." It is <a href="http://alloveralbany.com/archive/2009/07/20/the-oldest-building-in-albany">said</a> to have been almost destroyed in 1969 to make way for a ramp that would be built off of the new riverfront highway (I-787). Located in the heart of "Quackenbush Square," under a number of proprietors it has been a fine restaurant and a cornerstone of one of Albany's premier <a href="http://www.albany.org/VisitorCenter.aspx">cultural districts</a>!</p>

<p>As one of the most important "living landmarks" of early Albany history, the early history of the Quackenbush House <a href="../inprog.html">will be explained further</a> on this page!
