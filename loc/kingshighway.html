<p><b>T</b>his overland thoroughfare connecting the Hudson and the Mohawk was in existence from the earliest days of the community and was first used by Native American hunters bringing their <a href="../furtrade.html">furs</a> to <a href="../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and, after 1664, to Albany. <a href="#map1"><img src="../images/jpg/kingshwy1.jpg" height=635 width=221 align=left border=1 hspace=6 vspace=4 alt="Albany to the Verbergh"></a> "The Kings Highway" (<font size=-1> <a href="../res/sp.html">no apostrophe</a></font size>) is a <a href="#term">legendary</a> term that has been used to describe any of the country roads out of colonial Albany that may have been built by the British army during the French and Indian War. However, it most often refers to the <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Kings_Highway_Albany_Crop.png">main route</a> through the "Pine Bush" from <a href="#albany">Albany</a> to <a href="../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</P>

<p><a href="#rittner"><img src="../images/jpg/kingshwyrittner.jpg" border=1 align=right hspace=2 vspace=1 width=180 height=119 alt="the Kings Highway"></a> Until the mid-18th century, the Kings Highway was little more than a path through the woods. It was <a href="../art/ham.html#road">described</a> by traveller Dr. Alexander Hamilton in 1744 thus: "These woods form a copse above your head almost all the way betwixt Albany and Schenectady, and you ride over a plain, level, sandy road till (sic), coming out of the covert of the woods, all att (sic) once the village strikes surprisingly (sic) your eye, which I can compare to nothing but the curtain rising in a play and displaying a beautiful scene.”

<p><a name=verbergh></a> But this path was improved dramatically by British and provincial soldiers during the last of the colonial <a href="../7yw.html">wars</a>. After the war, many new settlers  were travelling west from Albany over this road. By that time, the western parts of it were maintained under <a href="#contract">contract</a> with the Albany <a href="../corporation.html">city government</a>.

<p><a name=albany></a><a href="#photo"><img src="../images/modern/highway.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hsapce=4 width=180 alt="marker near city hall"></a>On the Albany end, the Kings Highway began at the <a  href="#gate">Schenectady gate</a> of the stockade and continued west - uphill and into the pine barrens along the route of today's Washington Avenue.

<a name=christie></a> <p>The detail shown on the left is from a <a href="#map1">map of Rensselaerswyck</a> 
            made in 1767. It clearly traces the overland route from <a href="#albany">Albany</a> 
            (according to the map's legend) - past <a href="#verbergh">Christie's</a> 
            at Sandy Hill (#64) - west to "John Ritchie's at the Kil" (#65) - 
            then to "<a href="#verbergh">the Verbergh</a>" (#66) - then west to 
            <a href="../bios/t/istruax1678.html">Isaac Truax</a>'s tavern (<a href="#truax">#69</a>) near the northern 
            border of <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, 
            and finally the last seven or so miles west to <a href="#schenectady">Schenectady</a>.</p>

<p>At Schenectady, the wildnerness path became the budding community's main street (today's State Street). At the Schenectady <a href="../na/schenectady.html#end">end</a> of the Kings Highway, cargoes and travellers would then be loaded onto boats and moved west along the Mohawk into the Iroquois country and beyond.

<p>Mostly along the road and just above the densely settled part of the eighteenth century <a href="../im/im1770.html">city</a> a number of newcomer <a href="../bios/irish.html">Scots</a> had taken up <a href="../lists/list1779tlm.html">residence</a> by the latter stages of the <a href="../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. By <a href="../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>, these highlanders had opened their homes to recently arrived boarders. Buildings began to dot the way along <a href="../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a> - the western extension of State Street above the rapidly deteoriating ruins of the <a href="fortalbany.html">fort</a> and the newly laid out <a href="publicsq.html">public square</a>. John <a href="../bios/m/jmonier.html">Monier's</a> lumber yard and <a href="../bios/b/sabromley5963.html">Bromley's</a> inn were part of this development. These properties were shown on the <a href="../im/im1794.html">maps</a> made by Simeon De Witt during the 1790s.

<p>By <a href="../census1790.html#wmmk">1790</a>, the tavern of newcomer <a href="../bios/m/wmmckown.html">William Mc Kown</a> was a fixture in the vicinity of today's Fuller Road. In 1787, the city Council authorized repairs to the road from Albany to Mc Kown's "five mile house" and from Mc Kown's to Schenectady.<p>

<b>Map</b> detail showing the road from Albany to "the Verbergh." From a map of Rensselaerswyck made by John R. Bleecker in 1767. The most frequently encountered version (and the one used here) is copied from an engraving printed in the <a href="../sources.html#dhny"><i>Documentary History</i></a> of New York, III, 916-17. An <a href="../im/im1767.html">image map</a> further articulates this important resources.</p>

<p><a name=rittner></a><b>Photo</b> of a sandy road in the Albany pine barrens probably taken during the 1970s and copied from Don Rittner, <i>Pine Bush: Albany's Last Frontier</i> (Albany, 1976).
