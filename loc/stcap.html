<br>
<p>By 1810, New York had become the most populous and dynamic state in America. As "The Empire State," it would require a statewide government able to deal with burgeoning population growth and unprecedented economic expansion. "Initially, the New York State government met at the <a href="cityhall.html">city hall</a>. Well before Albany became the <i>de facto</i> State Capital in 1797, the rapidly developing <a href="#state">State government</a> had outgrown its initial host. 

<p>As this website is dedicated to the <b>people</b> of colonial Albany and their world, this exposition will focus on the social history of the first State Capitol building designed by Yankee architect <a href="../bios/h/phhooker.html">Philip Hooker</a> and commonly dated as 1803.
