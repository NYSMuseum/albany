<p><blockquote><blockquote><i><font size=-1>&nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp &nbsp; The <b>Colonial Albany Social History Project</b> is a model
community history program of the <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov">New

<p>&nbsp &nbsp; &nbsp &nbsp; The <b>Colonial Albany Project</b> was formed in 1981 to understand pre-industrial community life by studying
the contributions of the more than 16,000 <a href="criteria.html">diverse individuals</a> who lived in the city of Albany during its formative years. The project offices closed in July 2013 following the <a href="bios/staff/sbretirement.html">retirement</a> of its <a href="bios/staff/sbbio.html">founder</a>.  <b>However</b>, all of its activities <a href="welcome.html">continue</a> toward fulfilling the core goals and objectives as listed below.

<p><br>The <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> promotes awareness and understanding
of New York's rich and complex heritage through programs and services that
address the core experiences of the diverse peoples of New York State today. 
Database biographies for each of the <a href="pcalhindex.html#biographies">16,000 people</a> who lived in early Albany make the project personally relevant to an astounding number of living Americans. Because of its inclusiveness and the depth of its inquiry, the project sets a new standard for understanding life in early American communities. <a href="roster.html">Staffed</a> primarily by students and volunteers, the <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> represents a practical example of the community approach to historical <a href="#research">research</a>, <a href="#programs">programming</a>, and <a href="#service">service</a>.

<p>Please consider the comprehensive project <a href="guide/titletable.html"><i>Guide</i></a> as it represents the latest thinking on all things related to the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> and on each of these basic elements.</p>

  <li> <a NAME="research"></a><b><font size=+1><u>Research</u>:</font></b> Database 
    <a href="pcalhindex.html#biographies">biographies</a> are in progress for 
    each of the 16,000 people who lived in the <a href="earlycity.html">city</a> 
    of Albany before the Industrial Revolution. This population represents an 
    important core element of early New York society. The life course histories 
    of the people of colonial Albany are based on an exhaustive and systematic 
    search of <a href="cbr.html">historical records</a> and literary sources. 
    The biographical profiles are supplemented with a <a href="grapharch.html">graphics 
    archive</a> of visual images of early Albany people and their material culture, 
    community maps, cityscapes, and of comparative images from other communities.</li>
  <p></p>

<p>
  <li> <a NAME="programs"></a><b><font size=+1><u>Programming</u>:</font></b> Community 
    history is shared through a range of publications, lectures and public presentations, 
    portable exhibits, and more innovative educational programs. <a href="pgms/programs.html">Programs</a> 
    interpret the early Albany experience for diverse audiences including present-day 
    community members, descendants, the residents of other communities with similar 
    experiences, students at all levels, professional historians, and those interested 
    in particular themes ranging from childhood to community economics. This <a  href="welcome.html">website</a> 
    represents the newest programming initiative and is adding <a href="newfeatures.html">new 
    features</a> on an ongoing basis!</li>
  <p></p>

<p>
<li>
<a NAME="service"></a><b><font size=+1><u>Service</u>:</font></b> The <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> has provided intensive training in social history research and practical experience in the work of the community historian for more than 300 <a href="students.html">student interns</a> and <a href="prassociates.html">volunteers</a>. A comprehensive and frequently updated <a href="pub.html#cap">project guide</a> explains the community history approach to the past in theory and practice. As a model community history program, the project has assisted numerous groups and individuals in adapting its experiences and resources to other settings. The <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> provides guidance and
networking services for those studying early American social history.
A growing number of graduate theses, monographs, and articles have utilized
the project's research resources.</li><p></p>

<p><a name=logo></a>The <b>project <a href="#top">logo</a></b> is based on the outline 
  of the <a href="im/immiller.html">map</a> of Albany in 1695 (shown in the background) 
  as drawn by Reverend <a href="bios/m/jmiller.html">John Miller</a>. The thick 
  border reminds us that the people who lived in this early American city had 
  lives <a href="econ/comec.html">substantially different</a> from the farmers 
  and foresters who inhabited surrounding <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
  and greater <a href="albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. The stick figures 
  represent the diverse peoples (men, women, and children of all backgrounds) 
  who lived in the city before the Industrial Revolution and whose lives are at 
  the heart of all <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> activities. The logo was designed 
  by State Museum artist and friend Keith Prior during the early 1980s.</p>
