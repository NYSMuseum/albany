    <p><b>Project Definition</b> <font size=-1>(12/03)</font size></P>
    <p>The <I>Colonial Albany Social History Project</I> is a model community 
      history program. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> promotes human understanding 
      by interpreting the history of the <b>people</b> of a broadly constituted and dynamic 
      community that was the center of a large and emerging region over a two-hundred-year-period. 
      The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> was formed in 1980 for the purpose of 
      reconstructing a <b>people</b>-centered portrait of life as it existed in the city 
      of Albany, New York before the Industrial Revolution. 
	  
    <p>In order to understand that experience, the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> has undertaken a comprehensive program of historical research. Information 
      recovered from a structured search of primary sources provides a basis for 
      telling the story of the <b>people</b> of colonial Albany and the world in which 
      they lived. In the process, the project has created a new and unique set 
      of resources. These resources inform comprehensive person portraits for 
      each of the people of colonial Albany and enable the project to represent 
      their life experiences to diverse audiences including heritage groups, scholars, 
      and the residents of Albany today. The project employs a range of innovative 
      programming ideas in order to reach the broadest possible range of potential 
      audiences. At the same time, project programming is experimental in that 
      new research methodologies, delivery formats, and resources are enlisted 
      in an effort to promote history consciousness, heighten interest, increase 
      understanding, and broaden participation. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> 
      is a research and field services program of the New York State Education 
      Department and is located in the New York State Museum's Historical Survey.</P>
    <P><B>History</b> (4/94)</P>
    <P>&#9;The <I>Colonial Albany Social History Project</I> was formed in response 
      to three historical problems encountered by the project director. The first 
      followed Stefan Bielinski's biography of an eighteenth century political 
      leader published in 1975 by the New York State American Revolution Bicentennial 
      Commission as <I><a href="../bios/y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> and 
      the New Political Order in Revolutionary New York</I>. The Yates study raised 
      the question of why the people of colonial Albany turned away from a way 
      of life that they had created and that seemed to work for them and became 
      <a href="../or/or.html">revolutionaries</a> and supporters of the cause 
      of American independence. During the early 1970s, Bielinski initiated research 
      on local revolutionary leaders in the hope of answering that question. In 
      the process, he assembled a comprehensive archive of document copies related 
      to Abraham Yates, Jr. and a library of relevant historical materials. Although 
      research in these sources yielded some information on the community's political 
      culture and helped him develop a perspective on individual political ideology, 
      it did not reveal why the rhetoric of spokesmen such as Yates was persuasive 
      to the ordinary people to whom they preached. Scholarship directed at leaders 
      and other elites, regardless of how tightly focused, could unravel only 
      a narrow strand of the overall community mystery. The Yates project made 
      clear that the life experiences of the rank-and-file community members themselves 
      must be considered in order to address the question of motivation. The Yates 
      study also revealed that substantial records and even literary historical 
      resources existed that had not been utilized in previous works on early 
      Albany. While often based on substantial research, all of the traditional 
      literature had ignored important historical resources. Later, these unknown, 
      untouched, or underutilized historical resources would form the backbone 
      of the research plan implemented by the <I>Colonial Albany Social History 
      Project</I>.</P>
    <P>&#9;A second historical theme concerned the supposed transformation of 
      culture in provincial New York from a "Dutch" to an "English" frame of reference 
      or the so-called process of "Anglicization" as identified by John M. Murrin 
      in an article first presented in 1973 and later popularized by Michael Kammen 
      in his survey entitled <I>Colonial New York: A History</I>. In 1978, Stefan 
      Bielinski began to study the impact made on the so-called Dutch trading 
      community of Albany by Anglo-Saxon-ancestry newcomers during the late seventeenth 
      and early eighteenth centuries. In 1979, Bielinski presented a paper entitled 
      "Urban Britons in a Dutch Village: Anglicization in Colonial Albany," at 
      the annual meetings of the New York State Studies Group and the Social Science 
      History Association. The resulting commentary prompted further inquiry which 
      revealed that, although the cultural character of the community did change 
      over time, the new way of life was neither Dutch nor English. Instead, an 
      American cultural paradigm had been evolved in response to New World conditions 
      and new needs. As time passed, the gap between British expectations and 
      the reality of the American experience caused a divergence of Old and New 
      World cultures. This evolutionary process has been a major theme in American 
      history. A broadly based understanding of the lives of the diverse settlers 
      and residents of colonial Albany will provide a laboratory for observing 
      this phenomenon over two centuries.</P>
    <P>&#9;A third more general theme addressed the status of colonial Albany 
      as a frontier outpost and commercial and transportation crossroads, and 
      included its role in the hundred years of warfare between Great Britain 
      and France. Because Albany was a garrison town and, during the colonial 
      wars - a staging area for operations against the French, soldiers in the 
      city were an ongoing reality of life. The relationship of the army to the 
      people of the community was a significant theme in Albany's development. 
      Bielinski's study of Abraham Yates, Jr., and particularly of his career 
      as county sheriff during the 1750s, brought into question the place of the 
      rights of civilians in the face of the wartime needs of the British army. 
      This inquiry was informed by Yates's manuscript journal and copybook for 
      1754-59 which offered a focused and highly illuminating look at wartime 
      activities and at civil-military relations. Yates was an extremist in his 
      feelings on the primacy of civil authority and his views are clearly articulated 
      in his journal. But how did his neighbors feel about their place in the 
      British Empire and also about the powers and responsibilities of large British 
      and colonial armies which descended on their community during the Seven 
      Years War? This issue is critical to understanding Albany's support of opposition 
      to new British colonial legislation during the 1760s and 1770s.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> crystallized at a time when historical 
      inquiry in the United States was undergoing a dramatic transformation. During 
      the 1970s, historians across the country were able to shed new light on 
      the American past by broadening their concern beyond the leadership echelon 
      of American society and beyond the great moments, documents, and institutions 
      that survive as the legacies of our so-called "founding fathers." Traditionally, 
      these had been the guiding parameters of historical research. The "new" 
      historians sought to understand the development of American civilization 
      by studying the individual and collective experiences of the ordinary people 
      - of the so-called followers rather than the leaders. Since these common 
      folk constitute the vast majority of any society, their life stories are 
      critical to understanding the character and quality of life in the past. 
      Evolving from studies focused on the dynamics of town life in seventeenth 
      and eighteenth century New England, by the mid-1980s this comprehensive 
      and personally focused approach to research and analysis had turned the 
      historical profession upside down. Over the last two decades, the "history 
      from the bottom up" approach has been employed with great success by historians 
      and has become a mainstream scholarly genre still known as the "New Social 
      History."</P>
      <P>&#9;Inspired by the more broad concerns and personal focus of the scholarship 
        of the new social historians, Stefan Bielinski continued to pursue the 
        research agenda outlined above by searching for information on the everyday 
        lives of the rank-and-file people of eighteenth century Albany. That search 
        drove him backward in time to the European origins of their ancestors 
        (Albany's so-called original settlers) and, from there, forward through 
        their experiences over the next two centuries in America. In the process, 
        he was able to identify a large volume of previously unused records relating 
        to seventeenth and eighteenth century Albany in source repositories across 
        North America and abroad. The volume and diversity of these resources 
        were staggering. After some study, it became clear that a comprehensive 
        community study of colonial Albany could yield significant revisionist 
        findings if the resources to undertake such massive research and analysis 
        could be assembled. However, after some inquiry it became clear that funding 
        support for such an undertaking would prove extremely difficult in the 
        cultural climate of Ronald Reagan's America.</P>
    <P>&#9;A cooperative approach to the research based on identifying new sources 
      of energy might mediate immense labor requirements if such an effort could 
      be comprehensively conceptualized, efficiently organized, and strategically 
      managed. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I>'s record in this area is chronicled 
      in subsequent sections describing "Resources."</P>
    <P>&#9;Because of the heterogeneity of the original settlers, constant immigration 
      and migration, and the fragmentary and dislocated nature of documentary 
      records and material legacies, no one yet had been able to implement a community 
      resources-based study of an important Middle Colonies community. Nor had 
      anyone achieved comprehensive demographics as the basis for studying the 
      community-building experiences of the people of any New York, Pennsylvania, 
      of New Jersey pre-urban center. At the same time, no one had been able to 
      place a middle-sized early American community in its appropriate place within 
      regional, provincial, and intercolonial contexts. The research objectives 
      of the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> directly address these questions.</P>
    <P>&#9;The general program of the <I>Colonial Albany Social History Project</I> 
      is modeled on features of a number of pathbreaking historical efforts in 
      operation during the 1970s and 1980s. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> 
      has moved beyond the purely scholarly goals of the Philadelphia Social History 
      Project and has incorporated some of the public programming and service 
      initiatives employed by the Queens Social History Project, the New York 
      Chinatown History Project, the Broome County Immigration History Project, 
      and other community-based programs focused on the history of Baltimore, 
      Alexandria, Virginia, and Phoenix. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> gratefully 
      acknowledges the inspiration of these programs and also the research insights 
      derived from colonial Chesapeake studies undertaken in association with 
      the St. Mary's City Commission (Maryland), the York County Project at Colonial 
      Williamsburg, and the English local history movement as embodied in <I>Local 
      History Magazine</I> and in <I>The Local Historian</I> journal published 
      by the British Association for Local History. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> 
      has fortified its program with the most appropriate elements of those pioneering 
      experiences. As a result, the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> has been able 
      to develop a new set of historical resources, share these resources while 
      the research continues, communicate new historical insights to diverse scholarly 
      and public audiences, and provide a training ground and laboratory for historians 
      and inquiries reflecting the broadest range of the historical community 
      and consciousness.</P>

    <P><B>&#9;Purpose</b> (4/94)</P>
    <P>&#9;The activities of the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> (CAP) are inspired 
      by the goal of the New Social History to foster understanding in the world 
      today by presenting a comprehensive story of the dynamics of people living 
      together in the past. Specific project goals are:</P>
    <P><B>&#9;1.</b> To comprehend a full range of life experiences (from birth 
      to death - or the lifecourse) for all of the people who lived in the city 
      of Albany prior to its period of industrialization (generally involving 
      those born prior to 1800). These comprehensive lifecourse biographies for 
      all community members are based on an exhaustive search of documentary and 
      material resources.</P>
    <P><B>&#9;2.</b> To instill an appreciation of their historical experiences 
      broadly across society today by raising issues relating to important life 
      themes, to the roles of kinship, community, ambitions and interests, and 
      the impact of attitudes and emotions through the use of learner-based programming 
      ideas and innovative presentation formats.</P>
    <P><B>&#9;3.</b> To establish new professional standards for community history 
      research, programming, and community involvement.</P>
    <P><B>&#9;4.</b> To provide training and a range of historical services for 
      the people of Albany today, the residents of New York State, and beyond 
      by serving as a model community history program.</P><a name=aud></a>
    <P><B>&#9;Audiences</b> (4/94; revised 9/15)</P>
 <P>&#9;The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> directs its programming across a broad audience spectrum by including all members of the early Albany 
        community in its inquiry and by making its resources and services readily 
        available and widely accessible. Project programming and services are 
        dedicated to providing a personally relevant past for diverse audiences. 
        CAP programs and services are intended to benefit a wide range of people 
        both individually and in groups. In support of the State history office's 
        mission to promote history consciousness and to provide historical services 
        for the people of New York State, four specific audience groups receive 
        particular emphasis in the development of CAP resources, programs, and 
        services. These are the scholarly community of professional historians, 
        locally appointed historians across New York State, teachers of history 
        and social studies, and the people of Albany and of New York State today. 
        Beyond those core audience groups, the project has a special relevance 
        for descendants of the people of colonial Albany - who represent a population 
        today of staggering dimensions; and to the members of diverse heritage 
        groups including fraternal, religious, and activity organizations, sons 
        and daughters of antiquity, youth organizations, and centers for the elderly 
        and disabled - to name only a few. The absence of the term "minorities" 
        should not be surprising as we understand that the majority experience 
        of any larger social group is based on the melding of maybe countless 
        minority groups. In short, all people are different in some significant 
        way. To call them simply "<a href="../nnd.html">D</a>utch," "<a href="../afroalbanians.html">B</a>lack," "Patriots <a href="../or/or-3r.html">or</a> Tories" - and 
        an almost endless list of tags and/or labels, is to grossly oversimplify 
        their heritage, abilities, experience, and maybe countless additional 
        variables. This premise enjoins (or at least cautions) us from using 
        those labels beginning with "Majority." [ <b><a href="../bios/qqqq.html">?</a></b>  ]. </P>
	  
	  
    <P>&#9;Scholarly concerns share center stage with the promotion of humanism 
      in all <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> activities. An understanding and appreciation 
      of the life experiences of the people of colonial Albany is the central 
      focus of all project operations. The CAP is a manifestation of the State 
      Museum's commitment to advancing new understanding of the diverse people 
      of New York State in historical perspective. Because its most substantial 
      historical resources are comprehensive biographical profiles of each person 
      who lived in the community accompanied by material perspectives on their 
      lives, the CAP has created a historical resource that is unique in the United 
      States today and is frequently consulted by scholars, institutions, descendants, 
      and enthusiasts. To know and to appreciate the lives of all of the people 
      of seventeenth and eighteenth century Albany is the project's primary research 
      goal. To understand the world in which they lived and to set the people 
      of colonial Albany in appropriate historical contexts constitute close corollaries. 
      As a result of completed and projected research and analysis, no complex 
      early American community will have a more comprehensively defined socioeconomic 
      character or well-articulated cultural identity. Project resources and programs 
      provide scholars with new perspectives on the roles of local institutions, 
      kinship and other social networks, on interpersonal relationships among 
      community residents, and between people and their environments.</P>
    <P>&#9;Sponsored by the State Museum as a model community history program, 
      the <I>Colonial Albany Social History Project</I> provides direct service 
      in support of a provision in the State Education Law that empowers the State 
      Historian to provide guidance and training for the more than 1,600 locally 
      appointed county and municipal historians in New York State. The operations 
      of the CAP provide working models for community-based activities in project 
      conceptualization and organization, research design and methodologies, information 
      management, interpretive programming, community outreach, and public service. 
      The ongoing success of the CAP demonstrates the validity of community-based 
      history programs and documents the vital role that historians can play in 
      any community. These models also can benefit other family, community, and 
      local historians - whether they are motivated by professional interests, 
      heritage, or personal curiosity. The CAP is committed to training community 
      historians and provides educational services and support whenever possible. 
      Social studies teachers are advised how to adapt the community history framework 
      to their classroom situations. The operations of the CAP are directly applicable 
      to the programs of historical societies, to other history and heritage groups, 
      and to more general membership organizations as well.</P>
      <P>&#9;In addition to scholars, teachers, and organized history and historical 
        organizations, the CAP presents programs intended directly for individuals 
        with a wide range of needs. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> serves 
        residents of New York State today and also those with personal, professional, 
        and recreational interests in the region. The CAP provides people living 
        in Albany today with a historical perspective on their home place and 
        particularly on the way of life that evolved in one of the oldest American 
        cities. The insights CAP programs offer on life and on community dynamics 
        provide an essential substance for understanding personal heritage and 
        community identity. Albany's modern character as a center of government, 
        services, and communications is the product of over 300 years of community 
        life. The social fabric of the city has undergone dramatic changes since 
        the seventeenth century and continues to evolve as more people have begun 
        to seek out urban residences and as public and private sector enterprises 
        are becoming reestablished in a revitalized city. The project helps provide 
        a useable past for all those living in today's community. An appreciation 
        of Albany's early history provides sources for community identity and 
        helps instill a positive community image among residents of Albany today.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> has great potential as a resource 
      for presenting the complex and dramatic story of the people of colonial 
      Albany for the benefit of a larger world. An appreciation of that past helps 
      convey a positive and attractive image of New York State's capital city 
      to visitors and outsiders. The commercial and public relations potentials 
      of project resources, programs, and services make the CAP a valuable resource 
      for every community group.</P>
    <P><B>&#9;Operations</b> (4/94)</P>
    <P>&#9;Project operations are organized around and structured by three interrelated 
      activities. These elements are summarized below and are described in detail 
      in subsequent sections. Briefly, these elements are:</P>
      <P>&#9;1. <B>Resources:</B> New historical resources have been created based 
        on a comprehensive program of research and analysis. The principal research 
        objective of the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> is to develop a comprehensive 
        data base of information on the life of every person who lived in the 
        community before 1800. The biographical (or lifecourse) data base is supplemented 
        by archives of qualitative resources. All CAP programs rely on the lifecourse 
        biographies. The compilation and creation of the documentary, archival, 
        graphic, and artifactual resources which place those life stories in historical 
        and cultural contexts are integral parts of the research process. A data 
        base of information consisting of lifecourse biographies, an archive of 
        graphics materials, a calendar of historic events, property and estate 
        inventories, and a comparative research resource library are the products 
        of an exhaustive and open-ended search of relevant historical resources. 
        Each data base is organized to permit efficient access and updating of 
        information during the ongoing research process. The information organized 
        and stored as data then can be analyzed using social science research 
        techniques. Analysis is an ongoing feature of project operations.</P>
      <a name=pgm></a>
    <P>&#9;2. <B>Programming:</B> Images of life in an early American community 
      have emerged from analysis of the project's historical resources. Historical 
      themes are interpreted for general and specific audiences in programs using 
      popular and innovative delivery systems as well as traditional expository 
      forms. In an effort to improve accessibility, all CAP programs are experimental 
      and address specific audiences. Topics and program formats are chosen on 
      the basis of audience needs and abilities. Generally, programs conceived 
      for targeted audiences and are classified according to delivery format as 
      either publications, visual programs, media expositions, or dramatic presentations. 
      Programming is the most significant element of project activities because 
      it represents the most informed conception of the story of the people of 
      colonial Albany and of how it is most effectively presented to particular 
      audiences. A comprehensive exposition on project programming from subsequent chapters of  this <i>Guide</i><a href="../inprog.html"> will appear</a> online before too long.</P>

    <P>&#9;3. <B>Services:</B> <I>The Colonial Albany Project</I> has developed 
      a data base of historical resources that inform and enrich the lives of 
      people living today. Project programs represent the most regular and obvious 
      services. The project also tries to make its more basic resources available 
      whenever appropriate. Service is the most important element of CAP operations 
      because it builds bridges to today's communities. The project seeks and 
      also welcomes opportunities to make the early Albany story and the community 
      history approach a part of the educational programs of other institutions 
      and organizations. Project resources must remain accessible to all. However, 
      in providing project services, the four basic target audiences - scholars, 
      local historians and historical agencies, teachers and their students, and 
      the people of Albany today - have been accorded highest priority. Cooperative 
      programming is an efficient and desirable way to provide services.</P>

    <P><B>&#9;<a href="histres.html">Historical Resources</a></b> (4/94)</P>
    <P>&#9;The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> has none of the archival or artifactual 
      resources that are the traditional collections of historical organizations 
      and institutions. However, the CAP has developed a substantial body of historical 
      resource material. The project's historical resources consist of a data 
      base of information that in final form will be comprehensive biographies 
      of every person who lived in Albany during its first two hundred years; 
      an archive of copies of cartographic works, historic visuals, images of 
      material objects, and modern graphics materials that document their lives; 
      a data base calendar of community and related historical events; a data 
      base of real estate and other property information; an archive of documentary 
      and research resources relating to early Albany and to people in general 
      living in pre-industrial communities; and a library of materials on community 
      history in theory and in practice. These historical resources constitute 
      the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> "Collections" and are described in more 
      detail in the sections that follow. The project strives to make a unique 
      service contribution by adapting its resources to the specific needs of 
      individual clients and client groups.</P>
    <P>&#9;Functional resources enable the CAP to identify, assemble, organize, 
      develop, and interpret these historical resources. These resources are human 
      (staff and other personnel); institutional (the project facilities, collections, 
      and technological support provided by sponsoring agencies); and fiscal (central 
      funding, cooperative support, grants, and contractual incomes).</P>
    <P><B>&#9;Human Resources</b> (4/94)</P>
    <P>&#9;Given its humanistic goals and the social history focus of its research, 
      programming, and services, it is fitting that the <I>Colonial Albany Social 
      History Project</I> considers the contributions of those people who participate 
      in its operations as its chief functional resource. Because of its cooperative 
      nature, the project's ideal staff roster brings together humanists from 
      diverse backgrounds and must derive support from varied sources. Project 
      personnel are categorized as central staff, associated staff, volunteers, 
      and students.</P>
    <P>&#9;The central staff is headed by the <B>Project Director</B>, who is 
      responsible for the development and implementation of the <I>Guide</I> and 
      for the planning and direction of future operations. The director is the 
      project's senior scholar with training in the history of pre-industrial 
      society, experience in public and community history, and a strong commitment 
      to programming and service. The project director determines priorities, 
      provides program and service leadership, focuses the activities of other 
      staff members, and serves as the general project administrator. The director 
      is responsible for revision of the project <I>Guide</I> and also manages 
      the computerization of all data bases. The project director serves as coordinator 
      of the editorial committee and the project Advisory Group.</P>
    <P>&#9;Stefan Bielinski, historian, writer, teacher, a long-time advocate 
      of community history, and founder of the <I>Colonial Albany Social History 
      Project</I>, is its director. As a long-time employee of the State Education 
      Department and the State Museum, Stefan Bielinski has taken the lead in 
      sustaining institutional support and for adapting project initiatives to 
      SED and State Museum goals and objectives.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <B>Project Assistant</B> supports all activities. In 1989, Joyce 
      Patterson, a library clerk, was transferred to us from the New York State 
      Library. Her arrival was extremely fortuitous. After completing basic training, 
      her full-time dedication made an immediate and substantial impact on the 
      development of CAP research resources. Since then she has performed every 
      task in our research program and has escalated the pace of information retrieval 
      and processing in all areas. She serves as our liaison with the State Library, 
      prepares archival resources for processing, organizes information collected 
      by interns and associates, assists in program production and staging, and 
      maintains necessary supplies. She also provides internal support for interns 
      and other staff associates. As a result, project resources are much better 
      organized and much more accessible. Her presence in the office has enabled 
      the project to welcome phone and walk-in inquiries at all times. In addition, 
      Ms. Patterson's kindness and overall good humor have made a tremendous, 
      positive difference in the way the project actually functions.</P>
    <P>&#9;Over the past decade, the CAP has been able to support and/or staff 
      a number of other central staff positions. At present, none of those described 
      below are funded and their functions have fallen to the project director 
      and assistant and to some extent to project research associates. Filling 
      any of them on any basis would make a tremendous impact on project productivity.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <B>Research Coordinator</B> implements the research design by supervising 
      the collecting and recording activities of interns and volunteers. The coordinator 
      is responsible for the maintenance of research standards, consolidation 
      of data, and direction of program research on a project basis. The coordinator 
      is thoroughly familiar with all elements of the data collection process 
      and works closely with those engaged in collecting activities. The coordinator 
      oversees the development of all resource data bases - insuring that information 
      conforms to project standards. The coordinator supervises the internship 
      and Associates training program. Like the director, the coordinator plays 
      a major role in project programming and service activities.</P>
    <a name=burke></a> 
    <P>&#9;Bethany Newman Schroeder first defined the coordinator's position as 
      the project's first staff member during 1982-83. Thomas E. Burke, a teacher 
      of American History, the author of a <a href="../books.html#burke">book</a> 
      and several articles on Dutch Schenectady, and a graduate of the Associates 
      program, served as research coordinator from 1984 thru 1986. His wisdom 
      and dedication were critical to the accomplishments of our early years. 
      Since 1987, the coordinator's responsibilities have passed to the project 
      director although Tom Burke continues to uncover new sources that are placed 
      on the research agenda. His ongoing contributions and concern have more 
      than justified his designation as CAP <B>Research Fellow</B>.</P>
    <P>&#9;The title of <B>Research Historian</B> was created to recognize the 
      strong overall contribution made by Shirley Johnson Rice. After completing 
      the Associates training program in 1984, Ms. Rice's full time support dramatically 
      accelerated the pace of collecting and analysis activities. Ms. Rice's critical 
      role in the production of the <I>Women of Colonial Albany</I> community 
      history calendars for 1986 and 1987 and her contributions to our service 
      programs demonstrated the potential value of additional, trained staff. 
      Clearly, additional full-time historians would enhance the project's ability 
      to produce programs and provide more extensive services.</P>
    <P>&#9;Research Historians are experienced in all phases of project research 
      and analysis and work independently on elements of the information retrieval, 
      analysis, and data entry programs. Historians accept responsibility for 
      a particular historical resource area and participate and/or support programming 
      and service activities. Such staff activities make it possible for the project 
      director and research coordinator to focus on research, programming, and 
      services, and on development activities. One or more research historians 
      would make a substantial difference. These are recruited through the Associates 
      program described below. At present, Research Historians Jan Ghee and Tricia 
      Barbagallo, both graduates of the Associates training program, provide substantial 
      services in these areas on a part-time, volunteer basis.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <B>Graphics Coordinator</B> manages the Graphics Archive and is 
      responsible for providing artistic, photographic, and cartographic services 
      for all CAP operations. General graphics responsibilities include development 
      and maintenance of the project's Graphics Archive; supervision of the production 
      of publications; development (drafting, adapting, and revising) of creative 
      renderings of portraits, views, and maps; photographic services; and the 
      production of graphics materials to support project programs and services. 
      This staff member services requests from the history community and the public 
      in accordance with CAP objectives. The graphics coordinator plays a leadership 
      role in exhibit design, development, and implementation and integrates the 
      contributions of associated photographers, artists, designers, cartographers, 
      and curators. Ideally, this position is administrative and manages the activities 
      of students, associates, and consultants.</P>
    <P>&#9;Karen Phillips, an art historian and educator, defined the position 
      during her tenure from 1984 to 1987. At present, the project director has 
      assumed responsibility for development of the graphics archive.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <B>City Property Historian</B> is responsible for the development 
      of the City Property Program through the integration of information recovered 
      by interns and as a result of focused research on individual units of real 
      estate. This information manager organizes research materials according 
      to real estate unit (street and street address) files; chronicles improvements 
      to each unit over time; oversees the integration of real property information 
      into the life course biographies; maintains a map archive; and supports 
      programming by providing a spatial perspective on community lives.</P>
    <P>&#9;R. Beth Klopott, author of a doctoral dissertation on rural Schaghticoke, 
      was the Property Program historian from 1985 to 1987. At present, this area 
      has fallen to a lower priority although each new intern/trainee recovers 
      real property information and researches space use.</P>
    <P>&#9;The positions defined above for the Project Director, Project Assistant, 
      Research Coordinator, Project Historians - including the Graphics Coordinator 
      and Real Property Historian, constitute an ideal central staff. The funding 
      of these staff positions during 1986 enabled the project to play a major 
      role in the Albany "Tricentennial" celebration.</P>
    <P>&#9;Because of its location in the State Museum and the Cultural Education 
      Center, the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> has been able to call on a number 
      of talented and generous individuals to help achieve its research, programming, 
      and service objectives. Their specific contributions enable the project 
      to serve as a model community history program.</P>
    <P>&#9;Support staff are required to provide necessary technical skills. The 
      role of the <B>Graphic Artist</B> was defined by the contributions made 
      by Keith Prior, a member of the State Museum staff. He designed the project 
      logo, drew maps, adapted historic visuals, designed flyers and other publications, 
      and provided artistic advice and more miscellaneous services. Although he 
      has been reassigned, his talent and overall willingness during the 1980s 
      enabled the project to begin implementing its programming ideas. Since then, 
      Tricia Barbagallo has provided artistic support in these areas. Computer-driven 
      art seems to represent the most efficient direction in this area for the 
      future.</P>
    <P>&#9;Chris Supkis, a <B>photographer</B> on the staff of the Museum's Geological 
      Survey has provided significant photographic/artistic support since 1988. 
      He has produced more than 10,000 slides of historic and modern subjects 
      for use in project research, programming, and service activities. His ability 
      to provide slides and prints of features of portraits, scenes, maps, documents, 
      and other types of visuals uncovered by project staff has greatly enhanced 
      our scholarly and public programs. In addition, his creativity in production 
      work with colors and text and more recent videographic support makes him 
      a key member of the CAP team.</P>
      <P>&#9;An <B>Information Manager</B> services the data base information held 
        in computer memory and file facilities. This person advises on the design 
        of the data entry plan, supervises the coding and entry of data into CAP 
        data base, and provides technical support in the analysis of project data. 
        A humanist with computer skills who has been involved with the CAP on 
        a long-term basis is an ideal person for this position. Craig Williams, 
        a history curator at the State Museum, developed the initial computer 
        format and has provided critical technical support. His contributions 
        are gratefully acknowledged. As data is converted from mainframe to microcomputer 
        storage, new data processing skills will be required.</P>
    <P>&#9;A staff initiative in the areas of <B>Development </B>and<B> Programming</B> 
      would explore funding potentials; seek institutional and individual cooperative 
      support; establish and maintain a membership program; schedule programs 
      and service activities; and promote project resources, internally, among 
      potential external audiences, and to the public in general. This staff member 
      would solicit new resources, investigate programming and service opportunities, 
      and help coordinate activities in support of project goals and objectives. 
      The project director and other staff personnel must provide active support 
      in development activities. This is a critical activity area. Securing new 
      resources is basic to enhancing the project's success and strategic value.</P>
    <P>&#9;Ideally, "Development" and "Programming" are undertaken by different 
      individuals who might work together to achieve their individual goals of 
      adequate resources and optimal audience coverage. The functions of development 
      and programming/publicity should be the concerns of two salaried staff members. 
      It may be possible for a volunteer to raise funds to implement these critical 
      staff positions. The success of Shirley Rice in securing sponsorship for 
      the <I>Women of Colonial Albany</I> calendars suggests that resources will 
      follow marketable programs. Soliciting funds to support specific programs 
      is an approach the CAP continues to follow. The importance of development 
      and public relations activities cannot be overstated. More energy must be 
      devoted to these needs in the future.</P>
    <P>&#9;Because of the volume of human energy required in each operational 
      area, central staff members must focus on supervising data collection and 
      program development. The actual compilation and production should be accomplished 
      by project associates, interns, and colleagues. These individuals are the 
      miners who dig out and clean historical nuggets buried in the broadly defined 
      mountainous record of the past. They form the backbone of the CAP work force. 
      Workers fall into three general descriptive categories:</P>
    <P>&#9;1. Student <B>Interns</B> support <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> operations 
      under the auspices of a university or college-sponsored course or program 
      of study. Each intern participates in a program of basic training in social 
      history research. This exercise is designed to provide each project member 
      with a common body of knowledge and pool of historical skills. At the start 
      of the internship, students agree to support specific project objectives 
      for a defined duration. Each intern participates in an intake interview. 
      Interns are asked to study this <I>Guide</I>, read a number of historical 
      items, and are given a printed menu structuring their semester-long program. 
      They also receive supplementary instructional materials. The intern is introduced 
      to project operations, receives training in social history research, gains 
      practical experience and is encouraged to think historically, produces a 
      body of research material that becomes part of one or more CAP data bases, 
      documents all activities, and submits a summary paper. Interns are closely 
      supervised and are evaluated as a requisite for receiving course credit. 
      Evaluation sheets are shared with the students and their faculty mentor 
      and become part of the project's personnel file. Because project staff work 
      closely with each intern, the project is able to prepare informative letters 
      of recommendations and reference. Graduate schools and employers often solicit 
      evidence of an applicant's ability to perform in an applied environment. 
      Each year, the project director is asked to write several dozen recommendations 
      for current and former interns. All evaluation materials are shared with 
      the intern. Potential interns learn about the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> 
      through the project brochure and from the teaching and public presentations 
      of project staff members. Through these and other cooperative activities, 
      the CAP has developed linkages with members of the education community. 
      The continued support of educators and program administrators is critical 
      to the success of the internship program.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> is committed to excellence in historical 
      scholarship and to the training of community historians. Its record of service 
      as an educational facility is characterized by flexibility in accommodating 
      students from diverse backgrounds and varied needs. The project is a unique 
      resource for the training and focusing of interests of fledgling historians. 
      Since 1980, the CAP has cooperated with the "Special Projects in History" 
      (History 499 and 599) and Community Service programs of the State University 
      of New York at Albany. The long-term support and goodwill of Professor Ivan 
      Steen, director of Public History at SUNYA, has enabled the project to make 
      great strides in its research program and in the training of students. To 
      date, most of our interns have been students at SUNY Albany - typically, 
      graduating senior history majors.</P>
      <P>&#9;The semester-long, full-time research internship sponsored by the History 
        Department of the State University College at New Paltz; the "Albany Semester 
        Program" administered through Empire State College; the field placement 
        program at the College of St. Rose directed by Professor Honora Kinney; 
        the internship program at Sage Junior College of Albany mentored by Professor 
        Harvey Strum; the Skidmore College "University Without Walls"; the Union 
        College "Senior Honors Thesis" program; and a number of SUNY Albany programs 
        have enabled the CAP to provide a substantial training experience for 
        more than 200 students. A number of these interns have continued their 
        project connection in the Associates program, others have gone on to graduate 
        study in history, and still others have been able to utilize their CAP 
        experience as a recommendation for their employment in the history field. 
        A roster of CAP interns is included as an appendix.</P>
      <P>&#9;When consistent with the guidelines established by their college or 
        university, students have elected to take a second or even a third internship 
        program for course credit. The returning intern is employed in the advanced 
        research, programming, or services phases of project operations and is 
        not reassigned to the collection of basic information. As a graduate of 
        the basic training program, returning interns explore topics for specific 
        programs; learn how to present the past in publications, scripts, and 
        promotional material; and are involved in the production and staging of 
        programs. They also gain experience in the computerized elements of CAP 
        operations. Returning interns have compiled bibliographic aids and functional 
        guides, have conducted topical research, and have supported publications, 
        exhibits, and service activities with specialized research and production 
        support.</P>
    <P>&#9;The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> offers advanced training, guidance, 
      research opportunities, and a support network to further the education of 
      graduate students. More than two dozen graduate students from SUNY Albany 
      and other universities have conducted substantial research in CAP resources. 
      Graduate students must first complete the basic internship. Ideally, that 
      requirement is fulfilled as an undergraduate. In addition, former interns 
      have entered the Associates program after completion of course requirements. 
      A bibliography of project-sponsored graduate research topics is included 
      in an appendix.</P>
    <P>&#9;2. An <B>Associates Program </B>enables the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> 
      to recruit and train potential staff members and also provides an organizational 
      umbrella for those more generally interested in historical research. In 
      today's employment climate, volunteers have become an extremely important 
      human resource. Potential volunteers are given an initial orientation and 
      assessment, are asked to study the <I>Guide</I>, and are encouraged to enter 
      the Associates Program leading to the formal designations of "Associate" 
      and "Research Associate." Because the project must develop a core of well-trained 
      and dedicated individuals, the support of volunteers is critical to its 
      success. Recruiting interested volunteers, guiding them toward Research 
      Associate status, and then working toward their economic viability is a 
      priority concern of the project director and is supported by all other staff 
      members.</P>
    <P>&#9;All those who choose to take part in CAP activities as interns and 
      volunteers are asked first to complete the internship training program. 
      The training program is designed to acquaint the newcomer with the community 
      history approach to the past; make them aware issues in and of the state 
      of the practice of early American history; familiarize them with the <I>Colonial 
      Albany Project</I> and its operations; and provide practical experience 
      in using a variety of historical resources. A standard basic training program 
      provides a common core of useful knowledge for all of those associated with 
      the project. After completion of the one hundred hour basic training program, 
      the trainee is designated an "<B>Associate</B>" and is assigned to more 
      complex research and analysis duties.</P>
    <a name=resass></a> 
    <P>&#9;3. <B>Research Associates</B> are those non-student volunteers who 
      contribute substantially to project operations on a long-term basis. Research 
      Associates have completed the basic CAP orientation and internship programs. 
      They collect information, conduct complex research, and monitor the activities 
      of interns and newer volunteer historians. At that point, they have become 
      well-trained and experienced social historians. "Research Associate" status 
      is a formal designation and is conferred after 250 hours of contributed 
      services and the expression of willingness to support project operations 
      in the future. Research Associates maintain their active status by contributing 
      one hundred or more hours each year. Research Associates are acknowledged 
      in all attributed programs and are preferred as salaried staff in all funded 
      activities. This designation is intended to recognize substantial contributions 
      and is awarded with gratitude and admiration. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> 
      values its Associates and has enjoyed surprising success in supporting their 
      employment in the history field. A roster of Research Associates is included 
      in the appendix.</P>
    <P>&#9;4. <B>Resource Associates</B> are those professionals who bring a necessary 
      expertise to project activities. They are asked to serve as advisors, cooperate 
      in project operations, participate in the development and implementation 
      of grant-funded activities, and bring their special perspectives to the 
      overall climate of the program. Resource Associates are formally designated 
      to recognize substantial contributions to CAP activities. Charles T. Gehring, 
      translator and editor of Dutch manuscripts and director of the New Netherland 
      Project of the New York State Library, has been a valuable source of information 
      on the New Netherland Dutch, Dutch culture, and on Dutch language problems. 
      He is the first CAP Resource Associate and his support is critical to our 
      program. Leonard F. Tantillo, a historical artist specializing in the historic 
      Hudson Valley, has provided unparalleled visual perspectives through his 
      paintings and drawings of early Albany. His recreations of life in Albany 
      in 1686 have made central contributions to CAP programs. His knowledge of 
      spatial relationships and architecture has focused our perceptions of the 
      pre-urban cityscape. His work is described in the sections that follow. 
      Other potential Resource Associates may include cultural geographers, historical 
      archeologists, demographers, architectural historians; prints, maps, and 
      artifacts curators; manuscript librarians, curriculum development specialists, 
      and also videographers, cartographers, and other production specialists. 
      Resource Associates may be asked to serve as members of the Project Advisory 
      Group and are encouraged to counsel the director on operational matters.</P>
    <P>&#9;5. An <B>Advisory Group</B> representing professional interests and 
      constituents will help balance the course of project operations. This body 
      should consist of scholars, educators, representative of Albany-area educational, 
      service, and corporate institutions, and others with a relevant expertise 
      and interest in the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I>. Advisory Group members 
      offer advice on project operations and support project activities by cooperating 
      with educational and community groups and for specialized audiences. An 
      ideal Advisory Group would include the Chief of the State Museum's History 
      Survey, representatives of the academic community, the appointed Albany 
      city and county historians, and representatives from the Albany Public Library, 
      the Albany Public Schools, the Capital District Genealogical Society, Albany 
      Institute of History and Art, Albany County Historical Association, Schuyler 
      Mansion, Historic Cherry Hill, and the Urban Cultural Park. Members from 
      the larger public history and research fields also should be considered. 
      Twelve members would make an effective group. Formation of the advisory 
      group would represent an important step forward and should be done as soon 
      as any two more central staff positions are filled.</P>
    <P><B>&#9;Institutional Resources</b> (4/94)</P>
    <P>&#9;These are facilities and funding provided by the State Education Department/New 
      York State Museum; by other cultural and educational institutions; and by 
      membership, service, and private organizations.</P>
    <P>&#9;The History office at the New York State Museum in the State Education 
      Department provides the administrative umbrella for the <I>Colonial Albany 
      Social History Project</I>. The State Education Department is the institutional 
      sponsor and the State Museum is the operational home of the <I>Colonial 
      Albany Project</I>. The State Education Department provides office space 
      at the Cultural Education Center in Albany; office furniture, supplies, 
      and storage facilities; data processing, photographic, and printing support; 
      telephone and mailing services; funding for the project director and project 
      assistant; administrative and cooperative staff support; and additional 
      resources when feasible. These basic resources and sponsoring umbrella have 
      enabled the project to concentrate on its research, programming, and service 
      goals and not commit it best resources toward the fundraising activities 
      incumbent on most other similar programs. In return, the CAP is an active 
      participant in Museum and SED-sponsored programs and is generous in sharing 
      its resources with institutional client groups.</P>
    <P>&#9;At the same time, the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> must actively 
      solicit support from cooperating institutions. Cooperative support takes 
      the form of shared sponsorship (a formal designation entailing a substantive 
      allocation of resources); shared staff participation (staff time); program 
      funding (either directly, on contract, or in cooperative ventures); special 
      research and program development considerations (such as special access 
      to research collections, technical, production, and publishing support); 
      use of facilities for staging of programs; or flexibility in modifying existing 
      programs and courses to embrace CAP research or program objectives. Institutional 
      linkages are sought with public service agencies (governmental and private); 
      educational institutions (colleges, schools, and libraries); cultural institutions 
      (historical agencies and museums); and community organizations (heritage, 
      social, service, or other special interest groups).</P>
    <P>&#9;The comprehensive nature of the project research design requires a 
      substantial commitment to the development of research resources. The <I>Colonial 
      Albany Project</I> will seek research sponsors in the Albany area to support 
      information recovery and analysis. Obvious potential sponsors include the 
      Albany Institute of History and Art, Historic Cherry Hill, the Albany County 
      Historical Association, the Capital District Genealogical Society, the Dutch 
      Settlers Society, and history clubs and groups in local schools, family 
      and social organizations, and in the present-day incarnations of early Albany's 
      churches. A plan for investigating the potential of senior citizens (as 
      individuals and through their membership organizations) must be developed.</P>
    <P>&#9;Research sponsorship is a formal designation and requires an organization 
      or group to make a CAP research initiative (for example, the exhaustive 
      search of property records, church records, newspapers, family history resources, 
      sites, or artifacts) the scheduled activity of an organization's research 
      group. Project staff will organize individual projects, train participants, 
      and monitor results. Upon completing the requirements specified above for 
      Research Associate status, research sponsors will be designated as institutional 
      associates and will be acknowledged in program credits.</P>
    <P><B>&#9;Fiscal Resources</b> (4/94)</P>
    <P>&#9;Fiscal resources are required to support all project activities and 
      are categorized as follows:</P>
    <P>&#9;1. Central funding - the salary and benefits of the project director 
      and project assistant; office space, materials, and supplies; and travel 
      funds. These are drawn from the resources allocated thru the annual State 
      appropriation to the History office at the State Museum in support of its 
      programming and field services initiatives. The <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> 
      first became a regular budget item during the 1987-88 fiscal year when funding 
      was dedicated to personal services, travel, and equipment and supplies. 
      Maintaining adequate central funding is critical to project well-being. 
      However, experience has taught us about the limits of State support. More 
      visible broadly based fiscal resources would lift the project to a new level 
      of viability.</P>
    <P>&#9;2. Cooperative and In-Kind support - staff time, facilities, and supplies 
      provided by other units of the State Museum and by other organizations either 
      in formal cooperative arrangements or through the service programs of other 
      agencies. The resources contributed by interns, Associates, and other benefactors 
      also are accounted for in this category. At present, the CAP does not accept 
      monetary contributions nor does it have a "Friends" support group. Those 
      conditions could change in the future.</P>
    <P>&#9;3. Grants - direct funding awarded by granting institutions or received 
      as a result of fundraising activities. Funding is used in accordance with 
      the conditions of receipt to support the activities of central staff members, 
      Associates, and contractors. Grants also are used for operational purposes, 
      particularly to offset research costs or in the development and implementation 
      of programs. The project must establish a record of achievement in this 
      area.</P>
    <P>&#9;Funding for the Research Coordinator position became a priority concern 
      after central funding support was withdrawn in 1987. Thomas Burke's training, 
      experience, and personal commitment to the project made him an ideal person 
      for the coordinator's position. Toward this end, the CAP assisted him in 
      applying for grants to support specific elements of the overall research 
      design. In 1984 and 1985, Tom Burke submitted funding proposals for research 
      grants sponsored by the American Association for State and Local History, 
      and the American Council of Learned Societies. In 1988, Burke applied to 
      the National Endowment for the Humanities for three years of support to 
      produce an edited volume of a previously unpublished segment of the Albany 
      "City Records." Although none of those proposals were successful, we believe 
      such proposals are viable. The project will continue to seek research support 
      from traditional funding agencies such as the National Endowment for the 
      Humanities and the National Historical Publications and Records Commission.</P>
    <P>&#9;In addition, the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I> has applied for funding 
      for project research through grants submitted by Research Associates Beth 
      Klopott to the New York State Archives and Gerard Johnson to the New York 
      State Library. Neither of those proposals was successful - like Burke's, 
      chiefly due to a large number of applicants for a few grant awards.</P>
    <P>&#9;We understand that securing funding for research must become a focal 
      point of Development activities in the immediate future. Paid internships 
      and foundation, corporate, and other potential sources of support must be 
      investigated. The project needs help in this area.</P>
    <P>&#9;4. Revenues: These are funds derived from the sale of externally produced 
      publications and other CAP program items. At present, the CAP does not perform 
      research for clients on demand - preferring instead to share its resources 
      whenever possible. Numerous requests in this area and constant offers of 
      monetary compensation may change this condition in the future.</P>
    <P>&#9;5. Contract service fees: These are derived from teaching, the delivery 
      of programs, from invited participation in conferences and other programming, 
      and from consultations. These are applied to the CAP revenue account.</P>
