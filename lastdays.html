      <p><a href="#edge"><sup><b>*</b></sup></a><font size=+1> During the summer of 1770, local lawyer and sometime surveyor 
        <a href="bios/y/ryates.html">Robert Yates</a> made a map to help the Albany 
        <a href="corporation.html">common council</a> resolve a dispute over the 
        city's northern and southern <a href="citylimits.html">boundaries</a>. 
        Although it encompassed virtually the same terrain as previous city maps, 
        this "Plan of the City of Albany" represented a striking departure from 
        <a href="pcalhindex.html#map">those</a> made by British army engineers 
        during the seventy years past. The Robert Yates map documented changes 
        in the community since the end of the <a href="7yw.html">Great War for 
        Empire</A> and also serves as a canvas for illustrating Albany's evolution 
        during the <a href="or/or.html">critical decades</a> that followed.</p>

      <p>Like earlier representations,the Yates map featured a street grid set 
        against the hillside on the western bank of the Hudson. A shaded core 
        area covered nine blocks along the river and reached about six blocks 
        up the hill to the west. Outstanding features included the <a href="loc/cityhall.html">city 
        hall</a>, <a href="loc/markethouse.html">market house</a>, <a href="churches.html">churches</a>, 
        and other newfeatures. But missing from this version was the log stockade 
        that had encircled the central city for more than a hundred years and 
        was the most prominent feature of all previous cartography. The disappearance 
        of that proscriptive palisade was significant for it depicted an <a href="earlycity.html">emerging 
        city</a> for the first time without its military makeup.</p>

<p>The Yates map unveiled a budding urban center and clarified the fact that Albany's <a href="streets.html">streets</a> had been laid out for access to the river. On a typical day, more than two dozen sloops moored at the docks or riding at anchor and many more lesser craft tied-up or beached along the shoreline underscored the fact that the Hudson River was Albany's lifeline and that its economic vitality was closely connected to commerce and trade. In 1766, the city <a href="corporation.html">government</a> had underwritten construction of three large, earth-filled docks and the beginnings of a seawall. Those improvements were the first municipal commitments to reclaiming the muddy riverbank that had severely inhibited commerce in days past.</p>

<p><font size=+1> The <a href="loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>, first built by the English in the 1670s and <a href="garrison.html">garrisoned</a> by European-born soldiers for many decades after, was drawn by Yates but in an outlined 
        form that made it appear much less ominous than in earlier cartography 
        where its presence dominated the community. Erected two-thirds of the 
        way up the hill and in the middle of the <a href="streets.html#state">main 
        street</a>, the now obsolete stone and wooden structure stood as an impediment 
        to the development of the western parts of the city. In 1770, the fort 
        had no garrison, needed work, and was being vandalized for its stones, 
        lumber, and furnishings. The large <a href="loc/hospital.html">hospital</a> and barracks, built on the bluff north of the fort, still had some utility and were the last remnants 
        of the substantial alterations made by the British army just a decade 
        before. But they too had fallen into severe disrepair!</p>
