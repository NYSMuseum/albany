<p>The <i>Colonial Albany Project's</i> guiding premise is that a <a href="art/art-bbpast.html">community's 
  history</a> rests on the unique lives of every one of its diverse peoples. <A href="#portrait"> 
  <IMG align=left alt="Portrait of Anna Cuyler" border=1 height=245 
hspace=8 src="images/jpg/anna.jpg" vspace=8 width=181></A>Our basic unit of study 
  is an individual person's life. Our primary objective is to comprehend and integrate 
  the stories and contributions of every man, woman, and child who lived in the 
  city before the Industrial Revolution. All project <a href="pub.html">publications</a> 
  and <a href="pgms/programs.html">public programming</a> are based on the stories 
  of individual and groups of early Albany people during the first 200 years of 
  city life.</p>
 
<P>Since 1981, the project has conducted a focused program of <a href="art/art-welcome.html">historical 
  research</a> with the goal of constructing a detailed biographical portrait 
  of each of the <a href="criteria.html">16,000 different people</a> who lived 
  in the city of Albany during its formative years. Guided by an overall <a href="famrecon.html">research 
  plan</a> and supplemented by an almost-daily infusion of new information, many 
  of the profiles are <a href="bios/d/sdewitt.html">well-developed</a> 
  while others include only a <a href="bios/f/ifife.html">few 
  bits</a> of defining information. These lifecourse biographies are intended 
  to be comprehensive and to include every bit of relevant information on an individual's 
  life that can be recovered from a broadly defined historical record. We recognize 
  that goal may be unattainable but it has helped remind us never to give up in 
  the search for information!</p>
 
<P>In the quest for defining information, locating a likeness of each early Albany 
  person is among the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I>'s primary research objectives. 
  From an initial sweep of publications, we identified more than 300 images (formal 
  portraits, drawings, photographs, and renderings) of individuals in our study 
  population. At that point, research was begun on each of the images and on their 
  creators. Since then, more than 200 additional images have come to our attention 
  during the course of project research and through our information network. Copies 
  of each likeness were made and stored on slides. Today, these images still exist 
  in slide form and increasingly as digital files within the project's <a href="grapharch.html">Graphics 
  Archive</a>.</p>
 
      <P>Many original images such as <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/womenshistory/anna.html">Henrietta 
        Dering Johnston's</a> portrait of <a href="bios/c/annacuyler367.html">Anna 
        Cuyler Van Schaick</a> are found in well-known repositories including 
        the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org">Albany Institute of History 
        and Art</a> and the <A href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/">New York State 
        Museum</A>. Some reside in <a href="bios/s/pischuyler61.html#portrait">lesser-known 
        public places</a>. Others are in private hands. Still others that have 
        appeared in publications or have been described in the written record 
        have not yet been found by the <I>Colonial Albany Project</I>. However, 
        a surprising number of "new" likenesses have come to our attention. Optimistic 
        by nature, the project believes many, many others wait to be rediscovered!</p>

<p><font size=-1><a name="portrait"></a>This beautiful pastel <b>portrait</b> of <a href="bios/c/annacuyler367.html">Anna Cuyler Van Schaick</a> is part of the collection of the New York State Museum and hangs in the New York Metropolis hall. It is typical of the work of Henrietta Dering Johnston and was commissioned during the 1720s when the artist was working in New York. You might have noticed that the smaller image of this portrait has been reversed for effect on the <a href="gallery.html">gallery page</a> of this website!</font></p>
