<p>After almost two decades of searching and scrutinizing, we know that 
        <a href="criteria.html">16,000</a> different men, women, and children 
        lived in the <a href="earlycity.html">city of Albany</a> before the Industrial 
        Revolution. Although we have been counting them constantly for many years, 
        we know that total is only an estimate. But it is off only by a few hundred 
        "missing persons" who thus far have escaped identification and classification!</p>
      <p>But who were the people of colonial Albany? What were their <a href="familynames.html">names</a>? 
        Where did they <a href="newcomers.html">come from</a>? And <a href="homes.html">how 
        did they live</a>? These are the basic questions asked by the historians 
        at the <a href="whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a> 
        each and every day!</p>
      <p>The simple answer to these questions is that we conduct <a href="art/art-bbpast.html">historical 
        research</a> to identify early Albany people and to uncover, recover, 
        decode, and interpret the stories of their lives, of how they interacted 
        with each other, and how they reacted to the flow of history through the 
        outside world.</p>
      <p>Our basic plan has been to seek out and examine closely every historical 
        <a href="cbr.html">resource</a> that might yield information on early 
        Albany people. The volume and diversity of materials so far encountered 
        is, to say the least, staggering! As one might imagine, researching the 
        lives of so many people to the end of being able to answer more than a 
        hundred basic questions about each of their lives has proven to be a monumental 
        task that cannot be completed!</p>
      <p>Early on, we implemented a strategy for confronting the past that would 
        enable us to develop the individual biographies in a way that would make 
        them increasingly useful. Four overall research objectives: to identify 
        each person <a href="db.html">by name</a>, to set each person in time 
        (birth and death), to fill-out their lives, and to place each individual 
        on the <a href="timeline.html">historic community landscape</a>, have 
        structured our cooperative effort since 1981.<a name=1697></a></p>
      <p>Guided by the logic of considering the most comprehensive and accessible 
        resources first (beginning with the seemingly most obvious and the most 
        easily understood), we sought the oldest historical document that claimed 
        to identify every member of the community at a particular point in time. 
        Of course, no single document could do that! But closest to a baseline 
        list was the <a href="census1697.html">census of households</a> taken 
        in June 1697 as part of a colony-wide survey ordered by Benjamin Fletcher, 
        the royal governor of New York.</p>

<p>Sheriff <a href="bios/y/syoung6901.html">Simeon Young</a> and his deputies 
  scoured immense <a href="albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> and returned lists 
  of men, women, and children for each of the political jurisdictions. The list 
  for the City of Albany identified 174 different households accounting for a 
  total of 714 people. Although that document did not include slaves, missed most 
  of the soldiers who garrisoned the <a href="loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>, and 
  omitted several <a href="#omitted">prominent residents</a> and Sheriff Young 
  himself, the "Census of 1697" was the first historical document to account systematically 
  for the people living in the city of Albany. Although it actually named only 
  heads of households, we call that document a "Comprehensive Survey" because 
  it was represented as a complete enumeration of the city's inhabitants, giving 
  a total population, gender, and age breakdowns. Despite its omissions, that 
  document has provided a basic list of city people at the end of the seventeenth-century.</p>

<p>Using church records and other <a href="famrecon.html">reconstitution resources</a>, we were able to identify most of the spouses, other adults in the household, and many of the 386 children enumerated but not named in the census. These individuals provided a substantial base population for the pre-industrial city. An <a href="pub.html#guide">article</a> that closely examines the Census of 1697 was published in 1991 in a scholarly volume entitled <i>The American Family</i>.</p>

<p>To grossly oversimplify a process that continues to occupy all of our research resources, we then sought to fill-out some of the rest of the city's population by tracing the householders of 1697 back to identify the "original settler" or first family member in America. Then we moved forward in time to <a href="criteria.html">include</a> all of their descendants through the eighteenth-century who were born to Albany parents, became Albany residents themselves, or married city residents.</p>

<p>Because people entered and left the community from the time <a href="beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> became Albany in 1664 to the 1800s, we identified four additional and purportedly "comprehensive surveys" for <a href="census1679.html">1679</a>, <a href="census1756.html">1756</a>, <a href="census1790.html">1790</a>, and <a href="census1800.html">1800</a>, sought-out spouses, children, and descendants, and began biographical studies on each of those lives as well. That overarching reconstitution initiative yielded the names of more than 14,000 individual city people.</p>

<p>The remaining 2,000 early Albany people have been the subjects of more intensive individual study. These "special cases" were primarily of <a href="afroalbanians.html">African-ancestry</a> - slave and free, people of European background who lived in Albany but were not counted when those particular surveys were taken, or individuals so transient or so marginal that they did not connect in a historically visible way with the activities of the more mainline city population.</p>

<p>The <a href="whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a> is dedicated to presenting the story of an important early American <a href="art/art-ote.html">community</a> based on the contributions of all of its people. Inclusion <a href="criteria.html">criteria</a> have been established. A <a href="res/bios.html">research design</a> is in place. And every day we learn new details about the people of colonial Albany and their world. And almost that frequently, we can apply new learning toward understanding their lives more fully. The "People of Colonial Albany Live Here <a href="newfeatures.html">Website</a>" is the most public manifestation of our overall program!</p>

<p><a name=source></a>The "List of the Heads of Families and the number of men, women and children in each household in the City and County of Albany, the 16th of June, 1697" is found in volume 42 (beginning on page 34) of the "New York Colonial Manuscripts" at the New York State Archives. The  Albany, <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, and <a href="na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> returns have been transcribed and printed in <a href="sources.html#aa"><i>Annals of Albany</i></a>, volume 9, pp. 81-89. The Rensselaerswyck census is <a href="census1697.html#rw">now online</a>. The Schenectady portion of this survey also is available <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/census/1697sch.html">online</a>.

<p><a name=omitted></a>The houses of city fathers <a href="bios/a/jabeel124.html">Johannes 
  Abeel</a>, <a href="bios/b/ebancker6454.html">Evert Bancker</a>, and <a href="bios/d/jodewan6162.html">Johannes De Wandelaer</a> were omitted 
  from the 1697 Albany census - probabaly because they also were residents of New York City at that time.</p>

<p><a name=1800></a>The <b>Federal Censuses</b> for <a href="census1800.html">1800</a> and <a href="guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> were organized under heads of households but were expanded to include twelve categories of enumeration. They were: White boys under 10; boys 10-16; males 16-25; men 26-45; men over 45. White women were broken down under the same five categories. The final two columns counted other free people (Free Blacks) and slaves. For Albany <a href="wards.html">city</a>, the 1800 census was arranged by ward. But the 1810 census included no ward designations.</p>
