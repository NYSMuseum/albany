          <P><FONT size=+1><B>T</B></FONT>he so-called <a href="charter.html">Dongan 
            Charter</a> of 1686 established Albany as a corporate entity. From 
            that time on, the city's municipal rights and privileges have made 
            its growth and development substantially different from that of the 
            settlers and settlements of the surrounding countryside known as greater 
            <A href="albanycounty.html">Albany County</A>.</P>
          <P><a name=fathers></a><a href="commoncouncil.html"><img src="images/commoncouncil.jpg" align=left width=140 border=2 vspace=1 hspace=4 alt="first meeting of the Common Council - 1686"></a> 
            The city's governing <a href="org/cc.html">body</a> consisting of 
            the mayor, aldermen, and assistants, was commonly referred to as the 
            Albany Corporation. As time passed, these <A href="cityfathers.html">city 
            fathers</A> were more often called the Common Council. The <A href="mayors.html">mayor</A> 
            and recorder (deputy mayor) were appointed by the governor. The <A href="sheriffs.html">sheriff</A> 
            and the <a href="#clerk">clerk</a> (both of whom served the city and 
            the county) also were appointed by the governor. After those provincial 
            appointees, the <a href="org/cc.html">officers</a> of Albany's municipal 
            government were chosen locally.<a name=offices></a></P>
          <P><a name=council></a>Two aldermen and two assistants were elected 
            annually on September 29 by the principal (male and propertied) residents 
            of each of the city's three <a href="wards.html">wards</a>. Aldermen 
            usually were prominent and active merchants - most often under the 
            age of fifty. These important personages attended regular meetings 
            at <a href="loc/cityhall.html">city hall</a>, served on functional 
            committees, sat as magistrates, and served as <a href="cia.html">Commissioners 
            of Indian Affairs</a>. These Albany mainliners represented the <a href="familynames.html">major 
            families</a> and constituted the functional backbone of "home rule" 
            from 1686 on.<a name=treas></a></P>
          <p>A <a href="#cham">chamberlain</a> or treasurer was elected annually 
            by the members of the council (usually on September 29). The chamberlain 
            was the city and county's chief fiscal officer, handled all public 
            funds and was bonded. He was charged with keeping <a href="res/achorcr.html#treas">records</a> 
            of all financial transactions. His duties were proscribed in the <a href="doc/laws.html#treas"><i>Laws</i></a> 
            of the city published in 1773. <a href="bios/b/anbbradt4197.html">Anthony 
            B. Bradt</a> served as treasurer from 1698 until his death in 1722.
			<a name=marshall></a> 
<p><a href="bios/p/japarker5308.html">James Parker</a> was confirmed as the first city marshall in 1686. That office was salaried and functioned as the council's sergeant-at-arms, services administrator, supply chief, and also as its messenger. <a href="bios/s/joseeger7002.html">Johannes Seeger</a> held that post over four decades from 1730 to 1768 and was succeeded by his <a href="bios/s/thseeger.html">son</a>. <a href="bios/o/joost1478.html">John Ostrander</a> served as marshall during the early 1770s and into the first years of the Revolutionary struggle. <a href="bios/s/thseeger.html">Thomas Seeger</a> (son of Johannes) served again from 1778 probably to 1784. Beginning in 1784, newcomer <a href="bios/e/jaell7941.html">James Elliot</a> held the office - at least thru 1792. Like most of his predecessors, he was paid twice a year in a number of ways.</p>

<p><a name=retainers></a>Each year, the council appointed <a href="firemasters.html">firemasters</A>, 
            constables, assessors, porters, a cryer (perhaps also called "bellman"), 
            and other resident civil servants including watchmen, gatekeepers, 
            and whippers. It also licensed cartmen, <a href="loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>men, 
            and other contractors to perform specified services for fees. These 
            "city retainers" were the predecessors of today's civil servants. 
            In that way, several dozen additional Albany <a href="familynames.html">families</a> 
            were tied directly to <a href="loc/cityhall.html">city hall</a>. </p>
          <p><a name=freedom></a>Adult men born within the city of Albany were 
            accorded the right to vote and to participate in business, production, 
            and service <a href="econ/comec.html">activities</a>. This right was 
            called the "<b>Freedom</b>" of Albany. Newcomers also were required 
            to possess the "Freedom" or else could be fined for ilegal trading. 
            "Freedoms" were <a href="lists/list1781.html">purchased</a> or otherwise 
            attained from the city council. This <a href="art/mt.html#freedom">provision</a>, 
            however, seems to have been selectively enforced! 
          <p>Early Albany's municipal government was participatory and ran without 
            additional paid employees until the era of the <a href="or/or.html">American 
            Revolution</a>. Between 1775 and 1778, the incorporated city government 
            suspended itself. The extra-legal <a href="coc.html">Committee of 
            Correspondence</a> functioned in its place! Upon resuming operations 
            in 1778, the corporation addressed an expanded municipal agenda with 
            a more Albany city-based agenda.</p>

<p><a name=clerk></a>The <b>clerk</b> was the official records keeper for the city of Albany and for <a href="albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> as well for the most part throughout the eighteenth century or until the county was partitioned and new towns added - mostly following the War for Independence. The clerk was responsible for taking and keeping the minutes of the city government. At least some parts of those <a href="guide/histres.html#cr">records</a> have been printed in a number of sources and the manuscripts held at the ACHOR have been microfilmed. The clerk also issued legal writs and warrants, approved and filed (registered) <a href="res/realestate.html">deeds</a>, and was a key operative in the public business of Albany and its hinterland. Thus, the appointment was targeted and sought after by local and provincial authorities and by businessmen as well. <a href="bios/l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a> was the first and long-time Albany clerk. The office passed to his son <a href="bios/l/phlivingston86.html">Philip</a> in 1721. Upon his death in 1749, the office was bestowed on young <a href="bios/c/jocolden.html">John Colden</a>. 

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Today, The city of Albany has a <a href="http://www.albanyny.org/Government/Departments/CityClerk.aspx">dedicated clerk's office</a>. The Albany County clerk's office  <a href="http://www.albanycounty.com/Government/Departments/CountyClerk.aspx">serves</a> the entire county - especially those jurisdictions that do not have their own clerk.
