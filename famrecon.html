      <P><b>E</b>ach of the 16,000 individuals who lived in the city of Albany before 
        the Industrial Revolution has been the subject of <a href="art/art-bbpast.html">intensive 
        historical research</a> conducted over the past two decades as the core 
        activity of the <A 
href="whoarewe.html"><I>Colonial Albany Social History Project</I></A>.</p>

      <p>We are dedicated to learning all that we can about life in the past by studying 
        the individual lives of all of early Albany's diverse peoples. The stories 
        of these historical characters are basic to all project presentations. 
        <a href="pcalhindex.html#biographies">Biographical portraits</a> figure 
        prominently in project <A href="pub.html">publications</A>, <A href="pgms/programs.html">public 
        programs</A>, and, most directly, in the <a href="#exposition">expositions</a> 
        that appear on this <A href="welcome.html">website</A>.</p>

<p>A general understanding of biography-driven project research and research priorities is best gained by reading the web page entitled "<a href="stateoftheart.html">state of the art</a>" and by checking for research updates posted in the "<a href="newfeatures.html">New Features</a>" section.</P>

<P>As many as three-quarters of the historical characters in our study population belong to the <a href="familynames.html">150 families</a> residing in the city of Albany for more than two generations before 1800. Some of these families were found in Albany over seven or eight generations prior to 1800 while others were in Albany barely three. This core population represents the heart of our research program. Over the years, we have compiled extensive information on the members of each of these early Albany families and on each family in general. With the help of project members, associates, and benefactors, we continue to articulate and refine our archive on each of these families in their early Albany context.</p>

<p>To help structure family-based learning, ensure that the project has not overlooked legitimate study population candidates, and also that we have not included individuals who really do not meet the <a href="criteria.html">criteria for inclusion</a>, the <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> has adopted a research strategy we refer to as <b>"Family Reconstitution."</b></p>

<p>The goal of our family reconstitution program is to reconstruct the structure of each early Albany family by identifying (by name and life dates) each family member either born to Albany parents or who lived in the city before 1800; establish clear kinship lines for each family member; and then integrate all known information on an individual's life into the appropriate biographical file.</p>
 
      <p>Over the past decade, <a href="#reconstitutions">a number</a> of these major 
        families have been the subject of an increasingly structured reconstitution 
        procedure. These inquiries have been conducted by new interns as part 
        of their <a href="art/art-welcome.html">basic training experience</a>. 
        For each "reconstituted" family, our family files now contain an annotated 
        list of documented family members, one or more "family trees," an essay 
        on the particular family, a cache of printed family-based resources, and 
        other pertainent materials. Based on these resources, each person's biography 
        is further articulated and enhanced.</p>

<p>The reconstitution program continues with the arrival of each new project member. It is a basic experience that all project associates share. It provides hands-on contact with a wide range of historical resources, requires critical thinking and problem-solving, and provides the budding  community historian with the basic tools for developing a biographical profile for a range of early Americans.</p>
