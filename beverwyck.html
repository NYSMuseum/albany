            is the popular and <a href="res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional name given to the community of <a href="furtrade.html">fur 
            traders</a> that first emerged (perhaps as early as the 1640s) along 
            the river to the north of <a href="loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>. 
            That community of interest soon superseded the "fort" as settlers 
            set down permanent roots. The name came into official use in 1652 
            when the Dutch West India Company established a judicial jurisdiction 
            for the land north of the trading post/fort. That act began a legacy 
            of home rule for Albany that was primarily responsible for its development 
            into a pre-urban center. Immediately following, the first houselots 
            were <a href="#lots">parceled out</a>. By the end of the decade, a 
            log <a href="map/map1676.html">palisade</a> had enclosed the settlement.</P>

          <p>Anchored by an increasingly broad range of issues that were considered by the 
            Beverwyck court, by 1660 that community had achieved a commercial, 
            production, and services identity that would make it increasingly 
            different from surrounding <a  href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
            - basically a plantation of small farms and budding processing operations. 
            Although the Indian fur trade was at the heart of the <a href="econ/comec.html">community 
            economy</a>, a diversity of functions characterized the settlement 
            from its earliest days. During the 1650s, Beverwyck couples began 
            to raise large families that would give the growing settlement its 
            <a href="nnd.html">cultural character</a> for much of the next century.</p>

          <p>By 1660, the fur trade had become so competitive that <a href="lists/list1660.html">groups 
            of traders</a> were petitioning the court regarding conflicting visions 
            of the fur trading process.</p>

<p>In 1664, New Netherland fell to the English and Beverwyck was renamed "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_New_York">Albany</a>." The Beverwyck court was continued as the <a href="sources.html#cma">court</a> of Albany, Rensselaerswyck, and Schenectady. In 1673, New York was retaken by the Dutch and Albany was called "Willemstadt." The English regained jurisdiction in 1674 and the community has been called Albany ever since!</P>

<p>Today, the names of many Albany-area places, organizations, and things recall the community's <a href="timeline.html">earliest</a> incarnation. In 2002, a year-long <a href="http://www.albany.edu/mumford/heritage/">commemoration</a> marked the 350th anniversary of Beverwyck's formal establishment.</p>

These may be considered here in the future. The name of the place also has been <a href="res/sp.html">var</a>iously spelled. The <a href="whoarewe.html"><i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i></a> has adopted the <a href="res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional spelling used on this page for the sake of accessibility and because it is the spelling most frequently encountered in historical resources!</P>

<p><b>Sources:</b> The comprehensive and most readable source on the community is the <a href="books.html#jv">book by Janny Venema</a> entitled <i>Beverwijck: A Dutch Village on the American Frontier, 1652-1664</i> - a must read for all students and comparable to the most ambitious work on other <a href="earlycity.html">early American communities</a>. Thankfully, it is destined to serve as a primer for our subsequent work on Albany's ancestor! Also accessible in print is Janny Venema, "Poverty and Charity in Seventeenth-Century Beverwijck/Albany, 1652-1700," <i>New York History</i> (October 1999). Beverwyck pre-history is the subject of a recent and well illustrated archeological study by <a href="books.html#ba">James W. Bradley</a>.</p>

          <p><a name=lots></a>The <b>distribution of lots</b> within Beverwyck is considered 
            in detail by Venema in <a href="books.html#jv"><i>Beverwijck</i></a>. 
            Her exposition is aided and supported by several diagram maps. We 
            have just <a href="lists/list1650s.html">begun</a> to come to terms 
            with these initial settlers of the Albany community. However, that 
            monumental task cannot be a prime concern of the PCALHW initiative. 
            We do better with our official starting point for serious enquiry 
            = the people in the "city" <a href="census1697.html">1697</a> or maybe 
            (but not seriously) <a href="census1679.html">1679</a>.</p>
