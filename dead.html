<p><font size=+1> When <a href="bios/f/alforsyth5904.html">Alexander Forsight</a> died in 1818, he was buried in the <a href="presbyterian.html#upc">United Presbyterian Church</a> plot of the Albany municipal cemetery that was located in what is today's Washington Park.</font></p><font size=+1>

      <p>After <a href="loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a> opened in 
        1845, subsequent interments were made in the spacious new graveyard located in 
        the countryside about three miles north of Albany. By the 1860s, the old 
        cemetery in Washington Park had fallen into disrepair and the <a href="cityfathers.html">city fathers</a> 
        took steps to <a href="#relocate">relocate</a> the existing graves to Albany Rural.</p>

      <p><a href="#stone"><img SRC="images/jpg/tombstone.jpg" ALT="Forsyth Tombstone" HSPACE=8 VSPACE=4 BORDER=1 height=280 width=180 align=LEFT></a>Tradition 
        holds that the remains were loaded on wagons and carried out Northern 
        Boulevard to their present location in Menands. Although listed in the 
        official report as one of those removed to Menands, Forsyth's stone was 
        not among those that had been set in the old cemetery plot at <a href="loc/arc.html">Albany Rural</a>. 
        Until recently, it seemed to have vanished!</p>
 

      <p>Albany has a long and complicated history of caring for its dead. Births were 
        a frequent occurrence in early Albany households. Death was a constant 
        reminder of the frailty of life as almost half of those born to early 
        Albany parents did not live long enough to marry. Infants, children, adults, 
        and the aged were buried in church cemeteries located in various parts 
        of the old city and in <a href="loc/hallbg.html">family plots</a> located near city homesteads and in 
        the countryside. <a href="garrison.html">Garrison soldiers</a> were buried 
        in a plot located north of the <a href="loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>.</p>

<p><a name=drc></a>The first <a href="drc.html">Dutch Reformed</a> cemetery was located near the southern side of the city stockade - between today's Beaver and Hudson Streets. Previously, notable members were buried beneath the church. The other denominations initially utilized <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA160&lpg#PPA154,M1">plots</a> located adjacent or nearby the respective <a href="churches.html">churches</a>.</p>

        By the 1780s, the church cemeteries were full and burial places were no 
        longer appropriate for the heart of a developing urban center. At that 
        time, the Albany common council designated a block of land bounded by 
        today's <a href="streets.html#eagle">Eagle</a>, Hawk, Lancaster, and <a href="loc/statestreet.html">State</a> 
        Streets as the city's municipal cemetery. The <a href="http://albanynyhistory.blogspot.com/2011/10/state-street-burying-grounds.html">city plot</a> was apportioned 
        to the <a href="churches.html">four churches</a> and to leading Albany 
        families. At that time, <a href="afroalbanians.html">Afro Albanians</a> 
        were interred in a separate <a href="loc/nbg.html">burying grounds</a> located on a ridge above the Foxes Creek ravine.</p>

<p>With the rapid growth of Albany's <a href="population.html">population</a> following the American Revolution, the first city plot soon proved inadequate. By 1801, a new cemetery had been opened on public land near the western edge of the settlement just above newly laid-out <a href="loc/publicsq.html">Washington Square</a>. A few years later, the Eagle Street block was <a href="loc/publicsq.html">subdivided</a> into lots for development.</p>

<p>Four times as large as its predecessor, the Washington Park Cemetery was bounded by State, Robin, Hudson, and Knox Streets and also was divided into discreet church and family plots.
Unlike its predecessor, it included a section for Negroes and another for strangers. Many new graves were created to accommodate the needs of a booming city and to bury those who died during the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&biw=1418&bih=595&q=cholera+albany+new+york+1832&oq=cholera+albany+new+york+1832&gs_l=serp.3...3013.4596.0.5878.9.9.0.0.0.0.74.555.9.9.0.eprnk%2Cfr%3Dtrue%2Cfrlen%3D1...0...1.1.32.serp..8.1.65.mMLccHqkbAE">Cholera Epidemic</a> that swept Albany (as many other populated migration destinations in the United States) in 1832.</p>

        <p>Fueled by constant immigration, the city of Albany continued to grow and to 
          <a href="citylimits.html">expand</a>. By 1818, building lots had been 
          laid out facing Washington Square and now surrounded the cemetery on 
          three sides. By the 1840s, houses were built on those lots. Snipe Street 
          also was extended through the heart of the cemetery. However, the Washington 
          Park Cemetery was used until 1868 when the last remains were relocated 
          to <a href="loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>. A few years later, 
          the one-time city cemetery was transformed into part of Washington Park.</p>

<p><a name=relocate></a><b>Removal of graves:</b> In 1866, the city council published a listing of the graves removed entitled <i>Report of a Special Committee on Burial Grounds</i>. Over the years, we  have spent many hours at Albany Rural Cemetery attempting to locate the removed stones. <a href="res/ts.html">Tr</a>adition holds that the relocation of remains took place in 1868. That old publication has been transformed into an <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/StateStintro.htm">online resource</a>.

<p><font size=-1>This picture of <a href="bios/f/alforsyth5904.html">Alexander Forsyth</a>'s gravestone was taken by photographer James Goolsby and brought into our office for identification in 1988. He had encountered the stone in the backyard of a friend's home on the first block of Northern Boulevard a few hundred feet from the Washington Park cemetery. Perhaps it had been vandalized or had fallen off a wagon carrying remains out to Albany Rural cemetery more than a century earlier.
