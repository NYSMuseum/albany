<p>Established in 1771, the <b><i><a href="#sources">Albany Gazette</a></i></b> was Albany's first newspaper.</p>

<p>The <i>Gazette</i> was founded by Scottish-born printers <a href="bios/r/alrobertson1495.html">Alexander</a> and <a href="bios/r/jarobertson481.html">James Robertson</a> who reputedly came to Albany at the request of Sir <a href="bios/j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>.  Their printing office was on <a href="streets.html#court">Court Street</a>. Beginning on November 25, 1771, they issued a four-page weekly paper for about eleven months. No issues of the paper have survived after November 1772.</p>

<p>The Robertsons continued to produce contract printing in Albany for several more years. Ironically, one of their last clients was the Albany <a href="coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. The Robertsons were royalists and fled to New York City in 1776 where they opened a Tory newspaper.</p>

          <p>No newspaper was published in Albany during the American Revolution. The <i>Gazette</i> 
            was resurrected in 1784 by the <a href="census1790.html#webster">Webster 
            brothers</a>. The Websters' printing office was at the <a href="loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm 
            Tree Corner</a>.</p>

<p>The <i>Albany Gazette</i> ceased publication in 1845.</p>

<P><a name=sources>The most comprehensive source on Albany's <a href="ag.html">first newspaper</a> is Denis P.  Brennan, "Open to All Parties: Alexander and James Robertson, Albany Printers, 1771-1777," <a href="http://www.bard.edu/hvrr/"><i>The Hudson Valley Regional Review</i></a> (March 1993), 25-39.</p>

<p>We hope to chronicle the surviving <b>copies</b>. About twenty years ago, we encountered photostats of a nice run from 1771-72 at the <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/mssdesc.htm">Manuscripts and Special Collections</a> section of the New York State Library. The <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/">New York State Newspaper Project</a> has <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/nysnp/101.htm">microfilmed</a> the library's holdings from 1784 to 1817. Joel Munsell <a href="guide/histres.html#nn">excerpted</a> items from those papers and included them in his multi-volumed <a href="../../sources.html#aa">works</a>.</p>
