<P><font size=+1><b>T</b></font size>his initiative was launched in 1991 to address basic questions and issues related to why the people of Albany, New York would jeopardize an advantaged way of life that set them apart from most settlers living in the upper Hudson region, risk everything to oppose British restrictions, drive them to open rebellion, and then to the founding of a new state and nation. "The Other Revolutionaries" focuses on the experiences of six discreet groups of early Albany people during the two decades following the end of the colonial <a href="../7yw.html">wars</a> in 1763.</p>

<p>By the mid-1990s, "The Other Revolutionaries" had become the author's principal writing activity with supporting <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> research focused on the lives of the 3,000 early Albany people who lived through the so-called "Revolutionary era." By 1997, perhaps two-thirds of a draft manuscript had been produced and several conference papers were presented based on individual chapters. Several public programs also focused on themes then being explored under the "Other Revolutionaries" umbrella.</p>

   <p>"The Other Revolutionaries" predated any thought of the Internet as a major  programming  medium. It was conceived as a monograph-driven exposition  which would then be the basis for exhibitry and public programming. Articles would anticipate and also supplement the book publication.</p>

<p>But all that has changed as the book initiative has suffered greatly from the emergence of the "<b>People of Colonial Albany Live Here <a href="../welcome.html">Website</a></b>" as the project's principal programming pre-occupation. You might have noticed that the author has put aside almost everything else to <a href="../newfeatures.html">produce webpages</a>!</p>

<p>Parts of a couple of the chapters have found their ways into website expositions. These concern the <a href="../lastdays.html">last days of colonial Albany</a> and the group of early Albany people who <a href="../friends.html">did not support</a> the crusade for American liberties. Now, web versions of entire chapters have begun to appear on these pages!
