<p><a href="../bios/l/stlush416.html">Stephen Lush</a> winced as the sloop cleared 
              <a href="../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a> and headed for the 
              dock that jutted into the river in front of a large cluster of small 
              buildings. His first sight of the city of Albany in early 1775 left 
              him with the most mixed of feelings. Sent upriver to open a law 
              office for his mentor William Smith, Jr., he already knew that at 
              age twenty-two he would be the best educated and most well-connected 
              lawyer in the region. As the morning sun reflected off the timbers 
              of new buildings being erected in all parts of the old city, he 
              wondered whether the crude community coming into focus before him 
              would be able to satisfy any of his ambitions. Soon he would see 
              his <a href="../bios/l/rilush1047.html">brother</a> who had been 
              in Albany for several years - making his way as an importer and 
              land speculator. As he left the waterfront, this son of a sea captain 
              wondered about his future in a new place where everything seemed 
              to be in a state of flux.</p>

      <p> Acutely aware of the uncertain political situation and that his identification 
        with the Kings College establishment might require him to make some new 
        contacts in order to survive, he too was in transition. But Lush quickly 
        decided for the American cause. Before long, he would leave Albany to 
        serve with distinction in the revolutionary army, suffer as a captive 
        on a British prison ship, and finally return as the secretary to governor 
        George Clinton. His political aspirations were already forming. But in 
        1775, Stephen Lush could not dream that he would live the next fifty years 
        - the rest of his days as a leading resident of what would become New 
        York's capital city.</p>

      <p>Uprooted from a comfortable Montreal home, spinster <a href="../bios/l/mgtlivingston5041.html">Margaret 
        Livingston</a> was a refugee - living with her parents in a Market Street 
        house owned by her brother Colonel <a href="../bios/l/jalivingston8605.html">James 
        Livingston</a>. Although born in Albany, Margaret grew up in Canada where 
        her <a href="../bios/l/jolivingston5017.html">father</a> and brother engaged 
        in the Indian trade. As war clouds gathered, these Livingstons relocated 
        to family property at Stillwater and then fell back on Albany in anticipation 
        of a British invasion. At age thirty-seven, Margaret became reacquainted 
        with <a href="../bios/c/edchinn.html">Edward Chinn</a> - an English-born 
        frontier trader who served under her brother in the Canadian refugee regiments. 
        Coming to New York with his regiment in 1775, Chinn fought for the American 
        cause. Captured in in Pennsylvania, he was exchanged and then found himself 
        in Albany serving as a clerk in the Chamber of Accounts. In 1779, this 
        forty-seven-year-old bachelor married Colonel Livingston's sister in a 
        union celebrated by more than a dozen Livingston family members and other 
        members of Livingston's staff who, because of the war, also were refugees 
        in Albany.</p>

<p>The names of thirty-one men appeared on a <a href="../lists/list1781.html">document</a> 
              entitled "Freedoms Purchased, 1781." Complying with a city ordinance 
              to do so, each of these individuals paid between one and three pounds 
              for the "Freedom of the City," an official designation empowering 
              outsiders to conduct business or practice a trade with the rights 
              and privileges accorded Albany-born "Merchants, Traders and Mechanics." 
              Included in this diverse group were Scottish-born John Easton - 
              a cordwainer; newly arrived French merchant <a href="../bios/f/jofont1889.html">John Fontfreyde</a>; John 
              Ram - a German baker who had been living in the city since the 1760s; 
              and Hugh Orr - a Dutchess County native who previously owned a house 
              in Schenectady. As the war dragged on into its sixth year, the city 
              fathers sought to enforce war-suspended municipal ordinances in 
              an effort to regain control of a community economy that was undergoing 
              a transformation and suddenly had many new human elements.</p>

<p>This list of <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> represents a few of the several hundred people who found themselves living in Albany because of the war.  They were immigrants, refugees, and opportunists; but also soldiers, prisoners, and officials.  Some of them were not born in America, others were from established colonial families.  If not for the war, few of these visitors would have believed that their time in Albany was as anything but temporary.  With the British occupation of the lower Hudson and the perilousness of life on the frontier, the long war held all of these would-be visitors much longer than they would have anticipated.  Many of them left with the coming of peace - returning to pre-war homes, settling in other communities, or moving on to the new American west.  Others stayed on and played key rolls in Albany's transformation. This chapter <a href="../inprog.html">will consider</a> the newly arrived - their roles in the war effort and their impact on the Albany community.</p>

      <p>During the fifteen years following the fall of New France, more than a million 
        Europeans came to the American mainland. The pace of their unprecedented 
        transatlantic migration quickened during the 1770s - bringing more than 
        a hundred thousand new people each year until the start of the war. By 
        the eve of independence, many of these Europeans had migrated several 
        times more - from seaport cities, to large plantations and small farms, 
        to riverports and inland communities, and out to the frontier in an effort 
        to catch on. The war brought some of them to Albany. Some of them like 
        the Scots John Easton, <a href="../bios/f/alforsyth5904.html">Alexander 
        Forsyth</a>, and Colin Gibson set down roots in Albany. Others like <a href="../bios/f/ifife.html">Isabel 
        Fife (Phyfe)</a> who came to America with her young son Duncan to find 
        her husband, passed the war in Albany, and then moved on with the coming 
        of peace. Some of the younger newcomer men found themselves in the revolutionary 
        army. Their fathers and other brothers fit in along the Albany mainline 
        - becoming craftsmen and artisans or eking out an existence in the wartime 
        service economy. The stories of some of the others were more exceptional.</p>

            
<p><a href="../bios/t/jotunn1683.html">John Tunnicliff</a> of Derbyshire brought his family to America after the Seven Years War. By 1774, his large family and more than a dozen "followers" were working a model farm and ranch on the "<a href="../na/whitehall.html">Whitehall</a>" lands of Colonel <a href="../bios/b/jobradstreet.html">John Bradstreet</a>. While 
        John Tunnicliff was a pillar of the St. Peters vestry, his people also 
        had begun to develop Bradstreet's land in the Unadilla Valley at a place 
        called "Butternuts." Tunnicliff's English-born son, <a href="../bios/t/jotunnjr1700.html">John Jr.</a>, came to 
        Albany in 1772 and opened a clock and jewelry shop near the foot of State 
        Street. At the outbreak of the war, these Englishmen were suspected British 
        sympathizers with at-large Tories often seen near both the Whitehall and 
        Butternuts farms. Reports from the frontier charged old Mr. Tunnicliff 
        and son William with supplying the cheese and cattle to the British and 
        that Joseph Brant was a guest in their Unadilla Valley house. Although 
        Colonel Bradstreet was dead and his estate in limbo, Tunnicliff's settlers 
        were called back to the Whitehall acreage where they could be monitored 
        by Major <a href="../bios/r/threed.html">Thomas Reed</a> - a disabled revolutionary officer who was living in Bradstreet's house.</p>

<p>In the wake of the American victories at Saratoga, a number of newcomers settled in Albany at least until the end of the war.

<br><br>
<p>In 1782, recent Yale graduates <a href="../bios/b/sibaldwin.html">Simeon Baldwin</a> and <a href="../bios/l/jolovett.html">John Lovett</a> were engaged by the city council to teach at the new <a href="../org/albacad.html">Albany Academy</a>.
