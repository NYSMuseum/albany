      <p><b>E</b>ven before the signing of the peace treaty, the revolutionaries 
        turned their attention to distributing the tangible fruits of their awesome 
        victory. In 1782, the New York State legislature identified those who 
        would be eligible to receive bounty lands in reward for service to the 
        revolutionary cause. Basic lists of those judged deserving were the membership 
        rolls of the county militia regiments. Additional bounty lists and subsequent 
        grants further rewarded service in the New York Line and in other parts 
        of the Continental army. The <a href="../albanymilitia.html">Albany County 
        militia</a> was represented by seventeen regimental rosters. A <a href="../lists/listbr1racm.html">bounty 
        list for the First Regiment</a> identified many of the patriots who lived 
        in the city of Albany. Three hundred eighty-five names appeared on the 
        First Regiment bounty roster. Those names roughly represented the community's 
        male members who were between the ages of sixteen and sixty during the 
        struggle. With the obvious exceptions of major military leaders, virtually 
        all of the able-bodied men of the community who could be identified as 
        friends of American liberty were included on the First Regiment land bounty 
        list.<a href="#1"><sup><font size=-1>1</font size></sup></a></p>
      <p>These were the active revolutionaries - those who fought for liberty 
        and helped achieve American independence. But not all of them were soldiers 
        in the revolutionary armies. Nor did all of them march with the Albany 
        militia. The First Regiment bounty roster also included those who had 
        worked for the political revolution and also those who fought the war 
        on the homefront supplying and supporting the American cause with the 
        resources and services that enabled American forces to combat the British. 
        But who in particular was judged by the new government as a fighter for 
        American liberty? This chapter will begin systematically to address the 
        question of "Who were the Revolutionaries?" by approaching it from the 
        vantage point of the Albany community in order to evaluate the price of 
        liberty in terms of its drain on Albany's human resources and its strain 
        on the community economy.</p>

      <p>Most studies of New York during the American Revolution have included 
        some consideration of Albany's role in the war. Historians have agreed 
        that Albany was a hotbed of revolutionary activity and generally they 
        have painted a picture of a strategically located community imperiled 
        by the British, Tories, and Indians, inundated by soldiers, and transformed 
        into a military base, supply center, and hospital. They have pointed to 
        the wartime exploits of its military leaders, to the fervor of its active 
        and assertive committee network, and have presented anecdotes that have 
        helped sustain the mystique of Albany's iconoclastic nature. Unable to 
        find heroic deeds for its rank-and-file people, the community's traditional 
        historians mostly have ignored their wartime activities.<a href="#2"><sup><font size=-1>2.</font size></sup></a></p>
      <p>Those perceptions of Albany were based on a number of logistical as well 
        as historical factors. First, the upriver community was a comparatively 
        safe place and the principal patriot stronghold between the British in 
        New York City and in Canada. Albany was located at an important interior 
        crossroads and a critical transportation interchange. By the 1770s, Albany 
        was the established regional center and offered a range of human resources 
        not otherwise available north of New York City. And Albany people were 
        not unfamiliar with the dangers and exigencies of wartime conditions -- 
        having experienced them several times during the preceding colonial wars. 
        However valid, those facts have been interpreted mostly from the papers 
        and accounts of the important outsiders who stopped in wartime Albany. 
        At the same time, those external and top-down perceptions and the scholarship 
        they have inspired tell us very little about the actual community or its 
        people. Utilizing community-based resources and focused on the lives of 
        those actually living in Albany during the era of the Revolution, this 
        chapter will begin to address the wartime experiences of the rank-and-file 
        community by visiting each Albany home. That analysis begins with a discussion 
        of the soldiers. 
      <p>The city contributed a large number of officers to the Revolutionary 
        army. With no more than 500 men aged twenty to fifty living in the community 
        at the beginning of the war, more than fifty Albany residents were commissioned 
        as officers by the Continental Congress, New York State, or by another 
        revolutionary body. With some exceptions, these officers were Albany's 
        native sons all of whom were born between 1730 and 1760. They came from 
        the community's business families; a few had served in the last colonial 
        war; most had some experience in the militia. None of them were professional 
        or career soldiers. 
      <p>Nevertheless, Albany officers were well-represented among the legendary 
        heros of the Revolution. That recognition begins with the careers of Philip 
        Schuyler, Goose Van Schaick, and Abraham Ten Broeck -- sons of the city's 
        most prominent and traditional families, major players in regional business 
        enterprises, and veterans of the last colonial war. Those attributes and 
        experiences qualified each of these native sons for important wartime 
        responsibility. They served well -- making major contributions to the 
        winning of the War for Independence. Understandably pre-occupied with 
        their wartime commands at the regional, state, and county levels respectively, 
        they would not be able to focus much on community-level concerns. However, 
        as the principal figures in extensive military and supply networks, their 
        needs and concerns reached deeply into the Albany community. <br>

      <p><a name=gvs></a>The eldest son of an Albany mayor, <a href="../bios/vs/gvs.html">Goose 
        Van Schaick</a> also represented one of the community's first families. 
        His military career began in 1755 when the eighteen-year-old Albany boy 
        was commissioned a lieutenant in twenty-one-year-old Philip Schuyler's 
        company of New York troops. By 1758, he was a captain and veteran of two 
        major campaigns and was on his way to help take Fort Carillon from the 
        French. In a skirmish near Lake George, Van Schaick was struck in the 
        face with a musket ball. Rising above a disfiguring wound that ultimately 
        would claim his life, Van Schaick led his company through the disastrous 
        campaign and subsequent actions as well. Leadership ability and administrative 
        skills brought him two more promotions. By the end of the war, Lt. Col. 
        Goose Van Schaick was among the most experienced and highly regarded New 
        York soldiers.</p>
      <p><a name=gvsar></a>But this pre-eminent officer was primarily a businessman. 
        Raising a family in his new home on Market Street, by 1775 he was the 
        central figure in a family business network which exported farm and forest 
        products from extensive Hudson Valley land holdings. Courted by the British 
        who recognized his potential usefulness, Goose Van Schaick had declared 
        early for the American cause. A signer of the Sons of Liberty constitution 
        in 1766 and a member of the city Committee of Correspondence, he was appointed 
        colonel and called on to raise and equip an infantry regiment by the New 
        York Provincial Congress. Philip Schuyler placed him in command at Albany 
        with orders to forward men and supplies to the northern front. Filling 
        out his regiment with the young men of the community as well as with more 
        general recruits and ever in need of supplies and provisions, the colonel 
        was called on daily to balance wartime priorities with the rights and 
        well-being of his neighbors - the people of Albany. From his Albany headquarters, 
        Van Schaick commanded the "First New York Regiment" whose companies were 
        assigned to duties and outposts across the new state. A constant test 
        of his commitment and contacts was to maintain the regiment's strength 
        of more than 450 officers and men and to have them properly outfitted 
        and supplied. In 1778, the First New York marched to Valley Forge, took 
        part in the Battle of Monmouth (New Jersey), was deployed in the lower 
        Hudson Valley, and against the Iroquois in the upper Mohawk Valley, By 
        1780, the regiment had returned to Albany where the Van Schaick focused 
        on recruiting and supply -- serving as the Continental army administrator 
        for the Northern Department. Passed over for promotion and suffering from 
        progression of a now cancerous facial condition, Goose Van Schaick nevertheless 
        commanded his regiment in the Hudson Valley until the army was disbanded 
        in June 1783.</p>
      <P><a name=tb></a><a href="../bios/t/abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a> 
        was the leader of the Albany County Militia. Like his boyhood friends, 
        he came from an elite New Netherland family and was the son of an Albany 
        mayor. His business education began in the New York commercial house of 
        his sister's husband, Philip Livingston. After visiting other American 
        cities to enhance his understanding of colonial trade, he returned to 
        Albany to pursue a mercantile career. In 1763, he married the daughter 
        of the Van Rensselaer patroon and was named trustee and administrator 
        of Van Rensselaer manor on the death of Stephen Van Rensselaer II in 1769. 
        Before the war, he was one of Albany's leading developers - opening up 
        lots near the northern city line, overseeing construction of the north 
        dock, building roads from the city into Watervliet, and engaging tenants 
        on behalf of the Van Rensselaers. Many of these new people found additional 
        work in his mills, lumberyard, and stables.</p>
      <p>More so than Schuyler or Goose Van Schaick, Abraham Ten Broeck was essentially 
        an Albany figure who served on the city council, was an active member 
        of the Albany Committee of Correspondence, and was named mayor of Albany 
        following the death of John Barclay in 1779. This lumber magnate engaged 
        in a variety of related businesses which with many public offices made 
        him the most visible community member. At the same time, he acted as administrator 
        of the surrounding Van Rensselaer manor from 1769 to 1784. Ten Broeck 
        also served at the provincial level - representing Rensselaerswyck in 
        the colonial Assembly, and was elected to all four Provincial Congresses. 
        He was appointed to the Continental Congress in 1775, and was chosen president 
        of the New York State Convention in 1777. He later served as an Indian 
        Commissioner, in the state Senate, and in the judiciary. Despite scant 
        actual military experience, this wealthy Albanian was promoted through 
        the provincial militia ultimately attaining the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. 
        In 1775, he was named colonel of the Albany County militia and then Brigadier 
        General - with his command ultimately extended to Dutchess and Ulster 
        County as well.

      <p>Despite a deep pool of manpower within the general population, the strength 
        of the Albany militia was repeatedly sapped by the exemption of many of 
        the community's craftsmen and artisans from active duty and their assignment 
        to work activities by General Ten Broeck. Some of them were replaced by 
        even younger sons and by newcomers. But mostly, the city and Watervliet 
        regiments in particular remained chonically understaffed.

      <p>The city of Albany contributed important parts to the American war effort. 
        Some of its principal personages made outstanding leadership contributions 
        to the winning of the war. Others served in the rank-and-file of the revolutionary 
        armies at the continental, state, and local levels. Some Albany boys saw 
        active duty - fighting in pitched battles from Montreal to Yorktown. Yet 
        why were so few of their older brothers and fathers and so few of the 
        newly arrived residents of the community called on to march with the revolutionary 
        armies? The next chapter will look more closely at the contributions of 
        an even larger group of Albany revolutionaries.</P>

      <p><a name=*></a>These excerpts are taken from a draft chapter last revised 
        in January 1998. It focuses on Albany people in the military during the 
        Revolutionary War. They are presented here to provide a broader perspective 
        on the subject. Consider this essay to be <a href="../inprog.html">in-progress</a>! 
      </p>
      <p><a name=1></a><sup>1</sup> <i>New York in the Revolution as Colony and 
        State</i> (Albany, 1904), 221-22. Albany people were called to organize 
        into militia companies on May 3, 1775. Except for the British sympathizers 
        and adherents, unconnected migrants from other states, the most unsuitable 
        foreigners, invalids, the very old, and Blacks, the First Regiment roster 
        almost perfectly comprehends the community's at risk male population from 
        Abbott to Zabriskie. An assessment roll for March 1779 named 616 householders 
        in the city. The difference of 231 people between the First Regiment bounty 
        list and the assessment roll being made up of women householders (72), 
        officer/householders, older men, foreigners and newly arrived, Blacks 
        (2), and those who could not be called friends of Liberty.</p>
      <p><a name=2></a><sup>2</sup> The most focused of the scholarly accounts 
        of Albany in the Revolution come from Alice P. Kenney - foremost historian 
        of the New Netherland Dutch. Her Bicentennial booklet, Albany: Crossroads 
        of Liberty (Albany, 1976), encompassed her earlier work on the Gansevoort 
        family, on loyalists, and on Dutch culture. However, Crossroads of Liberty 
        is mostly about the regional theater and does not reach beyond the community's 
        elite residents. Kenney's overall approach to the eighteenth century is 
        summerized in Stubborn for Liberty: The Dutch in New York (Syracuse, 1975). 
        Don R. Gerlach's two volumes on Philip Schuyler and the American Revolution 
        in New York, 1733-1777 (Lincoln, NE, 1964) and Proud Patriot: Philip Schuyler 
        and the War of Independence, 1775-1783 (Syracuse, 1987), are tightly focused 
        on Albany's leading revolutionary and say surprisingly little about Schuyler's 
        city or the activities of his neighbors. The eye-opening The American 
        Revolution in New York: Its Political, Social and Economic Significance 
        prepared by the Division of Archives and History (Albany, 1926), was my 
        bible in early years. Despite the broad claim of its sub-title, like The 
        Bible it has proven inadequate. Edward Countryman's A People in Revolution: 
        The American Revolution and Political Society in New York, 1760-1790 (Baltimore, 
        1981), is the most comprehensive and interesting published treatment of 
        the era. But because of a broad synthetic sweep, it sheds little new light 
        on life in Albany. The antiquarian Albany histories produced by Howell 
        and Tenney, Joel Munsell, Cuyler Reynolds, and Arthur Weise cited in Sources 
        on the People of Colonial Albany: Narrative Sources, compiled by Tricia 
        A. Barbagallo (Albany, 1992), represented essential readings (and for 
        that matter the only narratives available twenty years ago) for my earlier 
        work on Abraham Yates, Jr. They too are preoccupied with larger military 
        concerns. However, they have been comprehended, corrected, and mostly 
        superceded by the works cited above and by this study.
