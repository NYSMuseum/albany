<p><b>O</b>n September 8, 1778, twenty-three Albany men aged fifty 
                to fifty five inscribed a memorandum exempting them from military 
                service on their promise to turn out to repel enemy invasion, 
                incursions, or insurrections. They elected aging slooper <a href="../bios/vs/covsvoort6721.html">Cornelis 
                Van Santvoort</a> as their captain and <a href="../bios/g/dagroesbeck3286.html">David 
                Groesbeek</a> and <a href="../bios/vi/mamvi2461.html">Marte Mynderse</a> 
                as lieutenants. Over the next months, the names of additional 
                middle-aged city men were added to the list of Albany's "<a href="../doc/1778ae.html">Associated 
                Exempts</a>." Earlier that year, the state legislature had created 
                that category of patriotism for those too old for active soldiering 
                but who could be entrusted with the role of a home guard. At the 
                same time, these artisans and shopkeepers could continue supporting 
                their families and sustaining the war effort in their most productive 
                capacities<a href="#1"><b>.</b></a> 
              
    <p>That enactment extended the commitment to liberty to more than thirty of 
      the community's households. The establishment of a home guard also helped 
      ease fears that the city might be left unprotected while its young men were 
      away - a condition previously unknown in Albany history. While each of the 
      "Associators" was awarded a <a href="or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in 
      conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany County militia, these 
      men were not required to march against either British or Tories. In fact, 
      their wartime experience of not actually fighting but still serving the 
      American cause represented a typical city scenario. Albany people on the 
      homefront played key and critical roles in the success of the <a href="or-3r.html">three 
      American Revolutions</a>. They were involved in setting up and running new 
      governments at the local, state, and national levels; supplying and sustaining 
      the war effort; and in finding new ways to accomplish these tasks in a wartime 
      environment with their community was located in the center of a major theater 
      of military operations. Overall, homefront patriots were more representative 
      of Albany's householders and far outnumbered the community's actual soldiers. 
      The older men known as "Associated Exempts" accounted for about five percent 
      of the city's householders and were part of a broadly based community effort 
      that made outstanding contributions to the revolutionary cause. This chapter 
      will consider their specific roles in the winning of independence and the 
      establishment of new political and economic orders. 
    <p>Throughout its history, Albany had been a place of opportunity 
                for those who could contribute. As the community economy evolved 
                over the past century, many new people settled in - more than 
                offsetting the departure of traditional people who no longer were 
                able to survive in an economic climate that had become more complex 
                than simply exporting forest and farm products. By the eve of 
                independence, a new Albany society had emerged. Those who remained 
                - the core community group or Albany's new mainliners, survived 
                based on their specific production and repair skills and on business 
                and human service talents. Those who left - failing crafts and 
                business people and most of the younger sons of traditional families, 
                represented an overflow group that could not be absorbed within 
                the new city economy. This evolution first manifested itself during 
                the last colonial war when virtually the only Albany city people 
                to actually fight against the French were the officer sons of 
                elite families, a few foreign immigrants, and even fewer younger 
                sons of marginal families who were not pressed into the wartime 
                production and service activities. Most of Albany's mainline men 
                were needed to supply and support the British and provincial armies. 
                With a dramatic increase in immigration and in-migration and the 
                first influx of European manufactured goods during the third quarter 
                of the eighteenth-century, the <a href="../lastdays.html">mature 
                colonial community</a> of 1775 was best represented by the merchant 
                who accepted farm and forest products as payment for an always 
                short supply but much in demand range of imported items; the shopkeeper 
                - often a one-time craftsman, who could repair and modify metal, 
                wood, cloth, and leather items - and provide domestic copies of 
                European imports; and the transporters, food brokers, and other 
                providers who embodied what had become a significant service economy. 
                At the center of these economic networks and at the top of the 
                opportunity pyramid were the officers of the city and county government. 
                These city fathers were accustomed to mobilizing and utilizing 
                Albany's diverse community resources. During the 1770s, the community's 
                assets were brought to bear in the war on the homefront and would 
                prove vital to the winning of the three revolutions in the years 
                that followed.</p>
