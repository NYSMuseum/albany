Second, in a Regiment raised for the immediate defence of the State of New York whereof Albert Pawling Esquire was Lieutenant Colonel Commandant, as will also appear by the Commission to the said John Ostrander as such Lieutenant hereunto annexed marked B.

<p>That her late husband the said John Ostrander served in the Army of the United States during the war of the Revolution under the said Commission from the month of February in the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy seven to the close of the war in the year one thousand seven hundred and eighty three. She further declares under oath as aforesaid and says that she lived with her said husband when he received the first commission at the <a href="../../bios/w/cawetz6619.html">East Camp</a> Livingston's Manor now as she believes in the County of Columbia in this state — according, to her best recollection and belief she then had two children.

<dd>That on receiving his commission her said husband immediately commenced recruiting soldiers for the Army, during a short time. That in the night before Easter Sunday of the same year, the house in which they then lived at the place last mentioned was accidentally burnt. That she her husband and children hardly escaped with their lives, all their furniture, cloathing [clothing] and provisions of every kind were destroyed.

That shortly after her said husband went to join the Army under General Gates at the North she moved with her children to the City of Albany and remained there until after the Capture of Burgoyne’s Army. That during [Page 2] the battles between American & British Armies, she almost every day went to the Riverside where the wounded, that were brought down the river in boats were laid down on the shore, to ascertain whether her said husband was not among them.

<dd>That the Regiment in which her said husband served or a part of it went into winter quarters at Johnstown in the County of Montgomery in this state but in what year she cannot recollect but believes it must have been either the winter immediately after the taking of Burgoyne, or the next succeeding winter thereafter from the circumstance that she then had as she believes but two children, her third child being born in June seventeen hundred and seventy nine. That her said husband procured a room for her at Johnstown and brought her and her children to Johnstown where she remained with him during the winter. That he then did duty as a Lieutenant. That shortly after she arrived at Johnstown, her said husband was taken sick with the small pox having taken the disease accidentally and had them so bad that during some time very slight hopes were intertained [entertained] of his recovery. She had her two children there Inoculated.

<dd>That her said husband from the time he entered the service as aforesaid until according to her best recollection and belief about the close of the year seventeen hundred and eighty was constantly with the army, excepting that he would occasionally come home on a short visit to his family, and she recollects that in some instances he was absent, and did not see his family during nearly six months at a time. That in these visits to his family he would state where he had been, and the actions in which he had been engaged, and she distinctly recollects that on one occasion he told her that he had been on Rhode Island with a part of the American Army and in several engagements with the british there — On another occasion during one of his said visits he informed her that he had been in some engagements between the American and British forces at or near the White Plains, and at another time, that he was in a fort at Schoharie at the time the British and Indians burned and destroyed many houses large quantities of grain and other property at that place, and that he was doing duty at these several times as a Lieutenant, but the periods at which these several events happened she cannot recollect. That she has heard all of the above facts of the services of her said husband related by him at various times during and after the close of the war, and has heard him also state that on some occasions he acted as adjutant or Major of the Regiment but when or on what occasions she cannot remember.

Wendell</a> who was a captain in the army who knew of his services on the subjects above mentioned. That she does not recollect who commanded the company in which her husband served during the period above mentioned. That she knows that all the [Page 3] officers she has named are now dead.

And she further on her oath says that between the two periods above referred to (viz) the spring of the year seventeen hundred and seventy seven and the close of the year seventeen hundred and eighty. She resided at different times in the City of Albany in Livingston’s manor before mentioned and at Rhinebeck in the County of Duchess In this state, as was most convenient for her said husband to supply her and her children with the means of support — and he having nothing but his pay and rations — That about the latter end of the year seventeen hundred and eighty but the day and month she cannot recollect by reason of her age her memory has become impaired, her said husband from feeling a sense of the helpless and indigent situation of this declaration and her children, she then having three children, and from an apprehension that the regiment in which he served might be ordered to some of the helpless and Indigent situation of this declarant and her children, she then having three children, and from an apprehension that the regiment in which he served [m]ight be ordered to some distance place, so as to render it difficult if at all possible for him to furnish them with necessary subsistence, was induced as he stated to her to resign his commission in the regular line of the troops of this state and the month of April seventeen hundred & eighty one.

That he sent for her & her children and had them removed to that house. That they continued to live together at this place until the close of the Revolutionary War.

That a Captain Pawling commanded the Company in which her said husband served as Lieutenant who was frequently at the house where she and her said [page 4] husband lived as above mentioned. That Captain Pawling was sometimes absent from the Company, at such times her said husband commanded the Company and discharged the duties of a Captain. That during the period last mentioned there were frequent alarms of the approach of the enemy on such occasions here said husband would immediately march with the said Company to such place as was designated, and ordered by a superior officer. That she has also during the period last mentioned seen Colonel Weisenfels at the said house as she believes in company with her said husband.

<dd>That when Peace was proclaimed her said husband marched with said company somewhere to the south and was absent some days but how long she cannot now remember, on his return he said he was discharged and the company disbanded but she does not recollect of ever having seen the discharges. That she does not know whether Colonel Pawling, Captain Pawling and Colonel Weisenfels or either of them are now living or not, nor where they can be found if living.
