<p>[<b>April 7, 1776</b>]

<p>Six o'clock, P. M., came to anchor four miles from <a href="../earlycity.html">Albany</a>; had a most glorious run this day, and a most pleasant sail; including our run in the night, we ran this day ninety-six miles —
Constitution fort being one hundred miles from Albany, and sixty from New York. We passed several country houses pleasantly situated on the banks, or, rather, eminences commanding the banks of the river; the grounds we could discover from the vessel did not appear to be highly improved. 

<p>[54] We had a distant view of the Katskill mountains. These are said to be some of the highest in North America; they had a pleasing appearance; the weather being somewhat hazy, they appeared like bluish clouds at a great distance; when we were nearest to them, they were distant about ten miles. Vast tracts of land on each side of Hudson's river are held by the proprietaries, or, as they are here styled, the <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Patrones or manors</a>. One of the <a href="../bios/vr/vr.html">Ransalaers</a> has a grant of twenty miles on each side of the river. Mr. Robert R. Livingston informed me that he held three hundred thousand acres. I am told there are but ten original patentees between Albany and the highlands. The descendants of the first proprietaries of these immense tracts still keep them in possession; necessity has not as yet forced any of them to sell any part.

<p><b>7th</b>. Weighed anchor this morning about six o'clock. Wind fair: having passed over the over slaw, had a distinct view of Albany, distant about two miles: — landed at Albany at half past
seven o'clock; received, at landing, by <a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1750.html">GENERAL SCHUYLER</a>," who, understanding we were coming up, came from his <a href="../loc/schuylermansion.html">house</a>, about a mile out of town, to  receive us and invite us to dine with him; he behaved with great civility; lives in pretty style; has two daughters (Betsy 
<a href="../bios/s/schuyler.html">and</a> Peggy), lively, agreeable, black eyed girls. Albany is situated  partly on a level, and partly on the slope of a hill, or rising ground, on the west side of the river. Vessels drawing eight and nine feet water may come to Albany, and five miles even beyond it, at this season of the year, when the waters are out. The <a href="../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> is in a ruinous condition, and not a single gun mounted on it. There are more houses in this town than in Annapolis, and I believe it to be much more populous. The citizens chiefly speak Dutch, being mostly the descendants of Dutchmen; but the English language and manners are getting ground apace.

<p><b>9th</b>. Left Albany early this morning, and travelled in a wagon in company with Mrs. Schuyler, her two daughters, and Generals Schuyler and [55] Thomas. At six miles from Albany I quitted the
wagon and got on horse-back to accompany the generals to view the falls on the Mohawk's river, called the Cohooes. The perpendicular fall is seventy-four feet, and the breadth of the river at
this place, as measured by General Schuyler, is one thousand feet. The fall is considerably above one hundred feet, taken from the first ripple or still water above the perpendicular fall. The river was swollen with the melting of the snows and rains, and rolled over the frightful precipice an impetuous torrent. The foam, the irregularities in the fall broken by projecting rocks, and the deafening noise, presented a sublime but terrifying spectacle.

<p>At fifty yards from the place the water dropped from the trees, as it does after a plentiful shower, they being as wet with the ascending vapor as they commonly are after a smart rain of some continuance. The bottoms adjoining the river Hudson are fine lands, and appeared to be well cultivated; most of them that we passed through were in wheat, which, though commonly overflowed in the
spring, we were informed by our driver, suffered no hurt, but were rather improved by the inundation. We arrived in the evening, a little before sunset, at <a href="../na/sarapat.html">Saratoga</a>, the seat of General Schuyler,
distant from Albany thirty-two miles. We spent the whole day in the journey, occasioned by the badness of the roads, and the delay the wagons [56] met with in crossing two ferries. The roads at this season of the year are generally bad, but now worse than ever, owing to the great number of wagons employed in carrying the baggage of the regiments marching into Canada, and supplies to the army in that country. General Schuyler informed me that an uninterrupted water-carriage between New York and Quebec might be perfected at fifty thousand pounds stirling expense, by means of locks, and a small canal cut from a branch that runs into Wood creek, and the head of a branch which falls into Hudson's river; the distance is not more than three miles. The river Richelieu or Sorel, is
navigable for batteaux from the lake Champlain into the St. Lawrence. The rapids, below St. John's, are not so considerable as to obstruct the navigation of such vessels.

<p>The lands about Saratoga are very good, particularly the bottom lands. Hudson's river runs within a quarter of a mile of the house, and you have a pleasing view of it for two or three miles above and below. A stream called Fishkill, which rises out of Lake Saratoga, about six miles from the general's house, runs close by it, and turns several mills; one, a grist mill, two saw mills, (one of them carrying fourteen saws,) and a hemp and flax mill. This mill is a new construction, and answers equally well in breaking hemp or flax. I requested the general to get a [57] model made for me by the person who built it. Descriptions of machines are seldom accurately made, and when done with exactness are seldom understood. I was informed by the general that it is customary for the great proprietaries of lands to lease them out for three lives, some times on fee-farm-rents, reserving, by way of rent, a fourth, or, more commonly, a tenth of all the produce; but the   proprietaries content themselves with a tenth of the wheat. On every transmutation of property from one tenant to another, a quarter part of what the land sells for is sometimes paid to the original proprietary or lord of the manor. The general observed to me that this was much the most advantageous way of leasing lands;—that in the course of a few years, from the frequent transmutations of tenants, the alienation fines would exceed the purchase of the fee-simple, though sold at a high valuation. General Schuyler is a man of a good understanding improved by reflection and study; he is of a very active turn, and fond of husbandry, and when the present distractions are composed, if his infirm state of health will permit him, will make Saratoga a most beautiful and most valuable estate. He saws up great quantities of plank at his mills, which, before this war, was disposed of in the neighborhood, but the greater part of it sent to Albany.

<p>[58] <b>11th</b>. Generals Thomas and Schuyler set off this morning for Lake George; the former to be in readiness to cross the lake on the first breaking up of the ice, the latter to forward the embarkation and transportation of military stores and supplies. 

<p><b>12th</b>. It snowed all this morning until eleven o'clock; the snow above six inches deep on the ground: it was not off the neighboring hills when we left Saratoga." -

<p><b>16th</b>. This morning we set off from Saratoga; I parted with regret from the amiable family of General Schuyler; the ease and affability with which we were treated, and the lively behavior
of the young ladies, made Saratoga a most pleasing séjour, the remembrance of which will long remain with me. We rode from Saratoga to McNeill's ferry, [distance two miles and a half.] crossed Hudson's river at this place, and rode on to one mile above Fort Miller, which is distant from McNeill's two miles. A Mr. Dover has a country-seat near Fort Miller; you see his house from the road. There is a very considerable fall in the river at Fort Miller. Just above it our [59] baggage was put into another boat; it had been brought in a wagon from Saratoga to McNeill's, carried over the ferry in a wagon, and then put on board a boat, in which it was conveyed to the foot of Fort Miller falls; then carried over land a quarter of a mile and put into a second boat.

<p>At a mile from Fort Miller we got into a boat and went up the Hudson river to Fort Edward. Although this fort is but seven miles distant from the place where we took boat, we were is exceedingly above four hours rowing up. The current rapid, and the rapidity was increased by a freshet. In many places the current was so strong that the batteau men were obliged to set up with poles, and drag the boat by the painter. Although these fellows were active and expert at this business, it was with the greatest difficulty they could stem the current in particular places. The congress keeps in pay three companies of batteau men on Hudson's river, consisting each of thirty-three men with a captain;—the pay of the men is £4.10 per month.

<p>The lands bordering on Hudson's river, as you approach Fort Edward, become more sandy, and the principal wood that grows on them is pine. There are several, saw mills both above and below Fort Miller. The planks sawed at the mills above Fort Miller are made up into small rafts and left without guides to the current of [60] the river; each one is marked, so that the raft men that remain just below Fort Miller falls, watching for them coming down, may easily know their own rafts. When they come over the falls they go out in canoes and boats and tow their rafts ashore, and then take them to pieces and make them again into larger rafts.

<p>The smaller rafts are called cribs. The ruins only of Fort Edward remain; there is a good large inn, where we found quartered Colonel Sin clair's regiment. Mr. Allen, son of old Mr. Allen, is lieutenant-colonel; he received us very politely and accommodated us with beds. The officers of this regiment are in general fine sized men, and seemed to be on a friendly footing; — the soldiers also are stout fellows.

<p><b>17th</b>. Having breakfasted with Colonel Allen, we set off from Fort Edward on our way to Fort George. We had not got a mile from the fort when a messenger from General Schuyler met us. He was sent with a letter by the general to inform us that Lake George was not open, and to desire us to remain at an inn kept by one <a href="http://www.chapmanmuseum.org/TheCorners/bipgraphies/abraham_wing.htm">Wing</a> at seven miles distance from Fort Edward and as many from Fort George. The country between <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Wing-923">Wing</a>'s tavern and Fort Edward is very sandy and somewhat hilly. The principal wood is pine. At Fort Edward the river Hudson makes a sudden turn to the westward; it soon [61 ] again resumes its former north course, for, at a small distance, we found it on our left and parallel with the road which we travelled, and which, from Fort Edward to Fort George, lies
nearly north and south. At three miles, or thereabouts, from Fort Edward, is a remarkable fall in the river. We could see it from the road, but not so as to form any judgment of its height. We were informed that it was upwards of thirty feet, and is called the Kingsbury falls. We could distinctly see the spray arising like a vapor or fog from the violence of the fall. The banks of the river, above and below these falls for a mile or two, are remarkably steep and high, and appear to be formed or faced, with a kind of stone very much resembling slate. The banks of the Mohawk's river at the Cohooes are faced with the same sort of stone;—it is said to be an indication of sea-coal. Mr. Wing's tavern is in the township of Queensbury, and Charlotte county; Hudson's river is not above a quarter of a mile from his house. There is a most beautiful fall in the river at this place. From still water, to the foot of the fall, I imagine the fall cannot be less than sixty feet, but the fall is not perpendicular; it may be about a hundred and twenty or a hundred and fifty feet long, and in this length, it is broken into three distinct falls, one of which may be twenty-five feet nearly [62] perpendicular. I saw Mr. Wing's patent, — the reserved quit-rent is two shillings and sixpence sterling per hundred acres; but he informs me it has never been yet collected. 

<p><b>18th</b>. We set off from Wing's tavern about twelve o'clock this day,

<p>[103] [August <b>6th</b>. Parted with General Schuyler this morning; he returned to Fort George on Lake George.We rode to Saratoga, where we got by seven o'clock, but did not find the amiable family at home. We were constrained to remain here all this day, waiting the arrival of our servants and baggage.

<p><b>7th</b>. Our servants and baggage being come up, we left Saratoga this morning at nine; took boat and went down Hudson's river, through all the rapids, to Albany. The distance is computed [104] thirty-six miles. We arrived at Albany half an hour past five. At six o'clock we set off for New York in a sloop: which we luckily found ready to sail; got that evening and night twenty-four
miles from Albany.

<p><b>8th</b>. Found ourselves, this morning, twenty-four miles from Albany; — at seven in the morning wind breezed up, had a fine gale, and got below the highlands;—a very great run.

<p><b>9th</b>. Arrived at New York at one o'clock, P. M.;
