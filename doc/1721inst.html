<FONT face=arial>
<p><a href="../bios/s/pischuyler1736.html">You</a> are with all Expedition to go with this Company of Young Men that are willing to Settle in the 
        Sinnekes Country for a twelve month to [derive] a Trade with the far Indians 
        that come from the upper Lakes, and Endeavour by all Suitable means to 
        persuade them to come and <a href="../furtrade.html">Trade</a> at Albany 
        or with this New Settlement. 

      <p>You are not to Trade with the four hithermost Nations but to carry your goods as farr as the Sinnekes Country to Trade with them or any other Indian Nations that come thither. 

     <p>You are to make a Settlement or Trading House either at Irondequate or 
        any other Convenient place on this Side of Cadarachqui Lake upon the Land 
        belonging to the Sinnekes, and use all Lawfull means to draw the furr 
        Trade thither by Sending Notice to the farr Indians that you are settled 
        there for their ease and Incouragment by my order, and that they may be 
        assured they shall have Goods Cheaper here than Ever the French can afford 
        them at Canada for the French must have the principall Indian goods from 
        England, not having them of their own. 
      <p>You are also to acquaint all the far Indians that I have an absolute 
        promise and Engagement from the five Nations that will not only suffer 
        them to pass freely and peaceably through their Country, but will give 
        them all due Encouragment and sweep and keep the Path open and Clean when 
        ever theyintend to come and Trade with this Province. 
      <p>Being informed that there are Sundry French Men called by the Dutch Bush 
        Loopers and by the French Coureurs Dubois who have for several years abandon'd 
        the French Colony of Canada and live wholly among the Indians if any such 
        come to Trade with you, with their furrs you may supply them and give 
        them all possible Incouragement to come hither where they shall be supplyed 
        with Indian Goods much Cheaper than at Canada. 
      <p>Altho the place where you Settle be Land belonging to the Crown of Great 
        Britain both by the Surrender of the Natives and the Treaty of Peace with 
        France, nevertheless you are to Send out Skouts and Spyes and be upon 
        your Guard the French not being to be Trusted who will use all means to 
        prevent the far Indians comeing to Trade with you or their comeing to 
        Albany. 
      <p>You are to keep an exact Dyary or Journall of all your proceedings of 
        any consequence, and keep a constant Correspondance with the <a href="../cia.html">Commissioners</a> 
        of the Indian affairs at Albany, whom I will order to give me An Account 
        thereof from time to time, and whenever you shall receive directions from 
        me to Treat with the Sinnekes or any of the five Nations you are to be 
        carefull to minute down your proceedings And their Answers, and to send 
        them to me with the first opportunity incloseing them to the Commissioners

        to mention such matters in your Letter to the Commissioners. 
      <p>When you come to the Sinnekes Country you are to give them a Belt of 
        Wampum in token that they are to give Credit to you as my Agent to Treat 
        with them of all matters relating to the Publick Service and the benefit 
        of the Trade, and at your desire to furnish you with a Number of their

        that it may be granted by Patent to those that shall be the first setlefs
