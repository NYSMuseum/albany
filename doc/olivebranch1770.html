<p><a name=intro></a><blockquote><center>ANCIENT COMMERCE OF ALBANY</center> 

<p><dd>It has heen the custom with fancy scribblers, since the triumph of steam, to amuse the public with much <i>facetia</i> at the expense of the honest <i>zeevaarderen</i> who were wont to navigate the Hudson in the last century, till the youngsters of this day have become pretty thoroughly imbued with the idea that the ancient commerce of the river is only worth remembering for the amusement it affords in lhat way. The real character of the old skippers ought to he rescued from such imputations and their sturdy, honest enterprise placed in its true light. We give below the manifest of the sloop Olive Branch, Captain <a href="../bios/b/abbgd7351.html">Abraham Bloodgood</a>, as [one] sample of what was occasionally done in the way of distant voyages before the Revolution. Capt. Bloodgood is still remembered by some of the older citizens,<a href="#*"><b>*</b></a> as are also most of the consignors, the memory of whom will he singularly enough awakened by this article. 

<p>The original account of sales of this voyage, from which we copy, is in the possession of Mr. Robert H. Waterman of this city. It affords a very interesting diary of the success of the adventure to Antigua and St. Christopher's with a very curiously assorted cargo of Albany merchandise, consisting of flour, herrings, horses, one negro man, and a great variety of the produce of this latitude; in exchange for which he brought hack eighty-one pounds of cotton, a much rarer article then 
than now, some cash, and much rum. </p>

<p><a name=*></a><b>*</b><font size=-1>He was the grandfather of simeon De Witt Bloodgood, late of this city and resided in the vicinity of the Fort Orange Hotel. He superintended the buildinhg of that house for <a href="../bios/d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a>, the surveyor-general, while the latter was abesent from the city. The original Fort Orange Hotel, it is well known, occupied the site of the <a href="../loc/fortorange.html">old fort</a> of that name, which stood opposite the Steam Boat Landing. The original Fort Orange Hotel fell a victim to the great fire of August 1848, and a new one has arisen from the ruins.</font size>

<p>These ventures lo the West Indies seem to have heen more common, after the war of the revolution, to Lansingburgh and Hudson, than to Alhany, from the fact that the editor of the <a href="../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>, in 1790, marvelled lhat the citizens of Albany should remain inactive spectators while their neighbors on the north and the south were participating in 
all the blessings of this valuahle trade." As an instance in lhe commerce of Lansinghurgh, it was announced that the sloop Arabia, Capt. Johnson, which sailed for  the West lndies in June, had sailed again in October on her second voyage thither, with a valuable cargo. On the 12th of April 1791, it was mentioned as a congratulatory event that 40 sail of vessels had arrived at this port in one day, or passed it 
for Troy and Lansingburgh ; that 18 vessels, of which 16 were of from 
40 lo 80 tons lay at the port of Lansingburgh, and that the sloop Naucy 
had performed atrip from thence to New York and hack in seven days. 
In Novemher of the same year it was ngain announced as an extraordinary 
occurrence, that 42 vessels of from 40 to 100 1ons, principally ahove 
70, were at anchor in 1he port of Alhany. 
Among other feats of sloop navigation in those days, we are told that 
Capt. William Van Ingen, of the sloop Cincinnati, sailed from Alhany 
on the 5th Decemher, 1794, and arrived at New York on the9lh ; disposed 
of his cargo, look in a valuahle freight, and returned lo this port 
on the 16lh. The navigation had then heen uninterrupted for nine 
months, and was still unimpeded by ice.

<p>The examples of speedy voyages whcih were boasted of in the last century, read a little oddly now, but yet the slops under a good wind, were an overmatch for the steamboats for a long time after the latter made their appearance on the river. In the year 1794, one Col. Wm. Colbreath, sheriff of Herkimer, left this city on a Sunday morning, on a sloop for New York, and returned on Thursday afternoon, the eleventh, 
having performed the journey in a little more than four days, including 
a day and a half he was in New York" The feat was perhaps as much 
a matter of wonder and admiration, as when the steam hoat had heen 
so much improved as to make the passnge from New York to Alhany 
in 24 hours.
