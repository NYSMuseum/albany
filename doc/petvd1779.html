      <p>To his Excellency George Clinton Esquire Governor of the State of New 
        York and Commander in Chief of the Militia thereof &c. &c. &c. 
      <p>The Petition of the Subscribers Inhabitants and Freeholders of the City 
        and County of Albany in the said State Humbly sheweth, 
      <p>That <a href="../bios/vd/hvdyck832.html">Henry Van Dyck</a>, late of 
        the said City of Albany, Practitioner of among others been sent within 
        the lines of the enemy, by the commissioners appointed to detect and defeat 
        all Conspiracies formed against this State, by virtue of a certain act 
        made and passed for that purpose, by the legislature of the said State. 
      <p> And, whereas, we are satisfied that the said Henry Van Dyck remains 
        with the enemy much against his Inclination, and that he is extremely 
        anxious to return home. And we also have good reason to believe from the 
        general tenor of his conduct during the present war that he was not, nor 
        is he now a dangerous Person to the liberties and Independence of the 
        American States. That by an extensive practice in physic the said Doctor 
        was very necessary to a number of respectable Citizens and other Inhabitants 
        of this county, whose Families, (as well as our own,) have already suffered 
        during his banishment. 
      <p>We do, therefore, most earnestly beg of your Excellency that the said 
        Doctor Van Dyck may be permitted to return to his Family and friends. 
        And that no detriment or Hurt shall arise to the public by such Indulgence, 
        We do pledge ourselves for his good Behavior. And your Petitioners shall 
        ever pray &c.
