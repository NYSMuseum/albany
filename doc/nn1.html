<p><b>1771</b>
 
<p>The first printing office in Albany, respecting which any information can now be gathered, was established in the latter part of this year, by <a href="../bios/r/alrobertson1495.html">Alexander</a> & <a href="../bios/r/jarobertson481.html">James Robertson</a>, who came up from New York for that purpose. Hence Albany was the second place in the state of New York, into which the art of <a href="../trades/print.html">printing</a> was introduced.
 
<p>The <a href="../charter.html">charter</a> of the city was printed this year in the city of New York, by Hugh Gaine, on a demy sheet, in quarto form, of which a copy is preserved in the chamberlain's office.
 
<p>The <a href="../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>, the first newspaper printed in this city, was commenced in November, by the Robertsons. It was printed on a sheet about one quarter the size of the largest daily papers now printed here. It is not known when this paper was discontinued, but its publication is supposed to have ended at the breaking out of the revolutionary <a href="../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, as the publishers are known to have joined the royalists in New York in 1776. A few copies of the paper are preserved in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany_Institute_of_History_&_Art">Albany Institute</a>, which were presented to that institution by <a href="../bios/w/rewesterlo6868.html">Rensselaer Westerlo</a> Esq. The volume containing the charter just alluded to, contains also a collection of the <a href="laws.html">city ordinances</a>, printed to match, by the Robertsons, in 1773.

<p><b>1772</b>
 
<p>Jan. 13. The printers of the <i>Gazette</i>, "from motives of gratitude and duty, are obliged to apologize to the public for the omission of one week's publication; and hope that the irregularity of the <a href="../org/po.html">mail</a> from New York since the first great fall of snow, and the severe cold preceding Christmas, which froze the paper prepared for the press, so as to put a stop to its operation, will sufficiently account for it.

      <p>March. A lottery was advertised to be drawn for the benefit of the <a href="../churches.html">Reformed 
        German Church</a> in Albany. (See <i>Annals</i>, vol. I, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_opPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=lottery+german+reformed+church+albany&source=bl&ots=D3qRiz9iaG&sig=aBmazazUGF3j84-Gk6PV-AsenGI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dl4ZUZ7eMsHB0AGa-YCwAQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=lottery%20german%20reformed%20church%20albany&f=false">p. 
        128</a>.) 
      <p>Among the advertisers in the <i>Gazette</i> is the firm of <a href="../bios/g/jagourlay8213.html">James Gourlay</a> & Co., "in Cheapside street, next door to the King's Arms." <a href="../loc/southside.html">Cheapside</a> street is now Green street, and the Kings Arms tavern was on the north-west corner of Green and Beaver streets, adjoining what was well known twenty years ago as the Old Stone House. On the breaking out of the war of the Revolution, the sign, which bore the device of the king's arms, was forced off by a party, one night, and burnt in State street.
 
<p>A noted merchant of the day, <a href="../bios/b/thbarry1821.html">Thomas Barry</a>, "near the Dutch Church," also enumerates his stock, occupying nearly a column of the paper with a catalogue of goods, with names which sound quite odd at this day; for instance, "none-so-pretty of various colors, and black breeches patterns."
 
      <p>July 20. The governor of the province. Gen. Tryon, visited the city, on which 
        occasion the corporation gave a public dinner at <a href="../bios/c/ricartwright6508.html">Cartwright</a>'s 
        Tavern (vol. I, 290). 
      <p>A meteorological table appeared in <i>The Gazette</i> occasionally.
 
<p>A book store was kept by <a href="../bios/w/stwilson.html">Stuart Wilson</a>, an <a href="../bios/irish.html">Irish</a>man, at the <a href="../loc/elmtreecorner.html">elm tree corner</a> of State and Pearl streets, in a Dutch house, which was afterwards converted into the Blue Belle tavern, the last keeper of which was the late Spencer Stafford's <a href="../bios/s/jobstafford.html">father</a>.

<p>Captain Machin was engaged in taking a water level between Albany and Schenectady, with a view to the supply of this city with water by means of an aqueduct. He submitted a plan to the common council, with drawings to show the manner in which an aqueduct and reservoir should be constructed, as we learn by a notice of the same at a later day.

<p>May. Messrs. <a href="../bios/b/soballantine.html">Solomon Balentine</a> and <a href="../bios/w/crwebster6841.html">Charles R. Webster</a> published the first number of <i>The New York Gazetteer or Northern Intelligencer</i>. The office file of this paper was destroyed by the great fire of <a href="../doc/fire1793.html">1793</a>, and the only copies of it which are known to exist, are in the Albany Institute.
 
      <p>Sept. 30. A meeting of the creditors of the United States in the state of New 
        York, was held at the <a href="../loc/cityhall.html">City Hall</a> in 
        Albany, <a href="../bios/s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> chairman; 
        the object of which was to lay their claims before the public, in an address, 
        and to suggest a general convention of deputies from the public creditors 
        of the states composing the union, to devise ways and means of payment.

<p><i>The Gazette</i> was enlarged, and Mr. Webster withdrew from it, and removed to New York. The paper was continued by Mr. Balentine alone. Its publication is supposed to have ceased in May, 1784.
 
<p>Mr. Balentine published a Pocket Almanac, for the year 1784, which is the first work of the kind that is known to have been issued in this city. A copy of it is preserved in the State Library.

<p>May 28. Charles R. Webster, of the late firm of Balentine & Webster, published the first number of a new paper, entitled <i>The Albany Gazette</i>, of which the State Library contains the office file down to the time of its discontinuance in 1845, when it was the oldest paper in the state, being in its seventy-second year.

The hours of study were from 6 to 8, and 8 to 12, in the forenoon; and from 2 to 5, and 6 to 8, in the afternoon. This to the magisters of our day, may appear to have been a pretty thorough drilling of "the young idea."
 
<P><a href="../bios/l/allaverty.html">Alexander Laverty</a>, "tayler from London," took the house lately occupied by <a href="../bios/h/hehart8358.html">Henry Hart</a>, in the back apartment, where he carried on the " tayler's business as cheap as any in town," and made payments easy to those who employed him.

<P>Nov. 8. The presbytery of New York ordained John McDonald a minister of the gospel, and he was at the same time installed pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Albany.

Tickets sold at Lewis's Tavern, and no money taken at the door. Boxes 8s. A vigorous effort was made to discontinue these performances, by a large and respectable part of community, but the common council determined by a vote of 9 to 4, that they had no legal right to prohibit theatrical exhibitions in the city. A whole number of the Gazette is taken up with the controversy, to the exclusion of every other subject.

Two weeks afterwards, the sheriff advertised that the person then under sentence of death in the City Hall would be hanged on Friday the fifteenth of September; and that any person willing to undertake the execution, was desired to apply to the said sheriff.
 
<p>July 22. The corporation and citizens of Albany celebrated the centennial anniversary of the <a href="../charter.html">charter</a> of the city (See vol. i, 335).
 
<p>The number of houses in Albany at this time was found, by actual enumeration, to be 550. A statement of the number of houses in the principal cities and towns at this time, will serve to show their relative proportions:
 

<p>Jan. 26. <a href="../bios/w/crwebster6841.html">Charles R.</a> and <a href="../bios/w/gwebster6848.html">George Webster</a> and Co., published a quarto paper, called the Albany Journal, or Montgomery, Washington and Columbia Intelligencer, which was published twice a week during the session of the legislature.

Clinton county was taken from Albany county at this session of the legislature.
 
<p>May 27. The election of members of assembly terminated in the success of the anti-federal party, and seems to have been the first party struggle growing out of the dissension on the question of the constitution. The vote of the two parties in the county of Albany, as canvassed on this day by the supervisors, stood as follows. John Younglove seems to have had the votes of both, or there is a mistake in the figures.

<p><a href="../org/ar.html"><i>The Albany Register</i></a> was begun this year, by <a href="../bios/b/robarber.html">Robert Barber</a>. 

<p>The impolicy of imprisonment for debt is aptly illustrated in the following case, where a rich and popular citizen incarcerates a humble artisan for his inability to liquidate his rent, who thereby becomes a charge upon the county, and a defaulter to all the rest of his creditors.
 
<p>"Whereas the subscriber (a master of shoemaking) is now confined in the City Hall, upper loft, for twenty pounds back rent which he is owing Gen. Schuyler; and as he is desirous of working for his living, and not to be chargeable to the good people of this city, he therefore humbly requests such of the citizens and others as are desirous of having well made shoes on the most reasonable terms, to favor him with their custom, and they may depend on being served on the shortest notice, and every favor shall be thankfully acknowledged by the public's humble servant Thaddeus Lawrence." 

<p>Aug. 8. The city of Albany, not to be behind her sister cities, set apart a day for public rejoicings, to celebrate the ratification of the constitution of the United States by the convention of the state of New York. Every trade and profession seems to have united in the jubilee, with appropriate emblems, and formed a truly imposing procession under the conduct of Gen, Schuyler. (See vol. i, 330.)

<p>November. The citizens were entertained with the extraordinary sight of an "uncommon bird," killed at Saratoga, and sent down as a rarity. "The distance from the tip of one wing to the other, when both were extended, was nine feet two inches; the mouth was large enough to contain the head of a boy ten years of age, and the throat so capacious as to admit the foot and leg of a man, boot and all." No one could decide what species the stranger belonged to, till the counsel of Dr. Mitchell of New York being called in, it was decided to be a pelican : perhaps the only one that ever extended his discoveries to this region.
 
<p><a href="../bios/vd/pivdu5567.html">Peter Van Deusen</a> and Jacob Van De Bilt established for the convenience of the citizens, a soap and candle factory, which useful branch of business, they say in their advertisement, had been long wanted in the city. To induce the citizens to encourage these domestic manufactures, they offer their articles at New York prices, thus making a saving of freight and cartage; and further to promote economy, manufactured for those who provided their own tallow, at 2.^ pence per pound, and furnish the cotton wick themselves.
 


<p><b>1789</b>
 

<p>Jan. 1. The thermometer at noon indicated 18° above zero; and on the following morning, at six o'clock, it was 24° below, being six degrees colder than had ever been known in the city.
 
<p>Jan. 5. The freeholders of Vanderheyden's or Ashley's Ferry, situate on the east bank of the Hudson's river, about seven miles above Albany, met for the purpose of establishing a naire for the place; when, by a majority of voices, it was confirmed that in future it should be called and known by the name of Troy. From its important state, and natural advantages, it was anticipated "at no very distant period to see Troy as famous for her trade and navigation as many of our first towns."
 
<p>The journals of the legislature for the session of 1789 were printed by S. and J. Loudon, at the house of Mr. Thomas McMurray, in Barrack (now Chapel) street, they being printers to the state.
 
<p>May. <i>The Albany Gazette</i>, on entering upon its sixth volume, began to be published twice a week.
 
<p>The following is given in the Register, as a particular statement of the votes of the several towns in Albany county for governor. The election was opened on the 28th April, for governor, lieutenant governor, senators and assemblymen.

<p>The returns were very imperfectly given by the papers, the adjoining counties being seldom reported, and never accurately. The poles were closed in the city, we are told, in the middle of the week; but in the east and west

<p>districts of the manor of Rensselaerwyck, ballots continued to be received until Saturday afternoon. The election of Governor Clinton was carried by the heavy majority from Ulster county, which gave him 1039 out of 1145.
 
<p>July 6. The legislature met at Albany. The message of Gov. Clinton, at the opening of the session, occupied thirty-two lines in the newspapers.
 
<p>On the first of June, the thermometer stood at 40°; on the 30th, at 80; on the 14th July, at 56; on the 24th, at 84; on the 12th August, at 80; on the 30th, at 47: these being the highest and lowest ranges for those months.
 
<p>At the July term of the Supreme Court, held in Albany, Elihu Smeeds of Pittstown in the county of Albany, indicted for the murder of Ezekiel Mitchell, and convicted of manslaughter, was adjudged to receive thirty-nine lashes at the public whippingpost, and be imprisoned three calendar months. Six others, convicted of stealing, were condemned to receive thirty-nine lashes each ; while about the same time, Francis Uss, convicted of breaking open and robbing a store in Poughkeepsie, was publicly hanged.
 
<p>There was a scarcity of bread stuffs this year, throughout the country, and complaints were made of monopolizers. Flour sold at New Orleans for twelve dollars a barrel. Complaints were frequent of the scarcity of provisions in the western part of the state, on account of the flood of immigrants. In the vicinity of Niagara, it was difficult to subsist the new comers. A letter from "Cooper's Town, Otsego Lake," May 7, says : "The vast multitude of people that come daily to this country have caused a scarcity of provisions almost to a famine. In the Genesee it is quite so. Corn will bring ten shillings in cash, and six shillings at Albany ; and it is said potatoes at Niagara are twenty shillings. However alarming this may be, it proceeds from no other cause than that of an innumerable quantity of people flocking in. I have had thirty in a day seeking land of me."
 
<p>Nov. 3. A snowstorm commenced at ten in the morning, and continued during the day; and the weather was remarkably cold, having every appearance of winter : a circumstance not before recollected by any of the inhabitants at so early a period.

<p>The amount of receipts and disbursements of the city of Albany for the first six years succeeding the revolution, was as follows; [MISSING]
 
<p>January. It was deemed "indispensably necessary" by Mr. Cornelius J. Wynkoop, that there should be in the city "an auctioneer and vendue master for dry goods, household furniture, &c." Whereupon he opened at No. 8 Market street, "a licensed auction office."
 
<p>Feb. 1. The legislature granted Ananias Platt the exclusive right of running a stage between Albany and Lansingburgh.
 
<p>April 2. The legislature passed an act for the improvement of the navigation of the Overslaugh, by allowing the proprietors of Mills and Papskni islands to erect a dam to prevent the passage of the water between them, and throw it into the main channel. This, it was thought, would more effectually benefit the navigation, than the employment of "an unwieldy machine, which at best only affords a temporary relief."
 
<p>The prisoners confined for debt in the city hall, which was the jail, celebrated the 5th July (the 4th being Sunday). There was an allusion to the fifteenth year of American independence, and their confinement for debt. Their fifth toast was : "May the time come when no honest man shall be confined for debt." The time did arrive, in less than half a century, when dishonest men even were seldom confined for debt.
 
<p>October. The mail stage between Albany and New York, which seems to have been suspended, was announced to commence running twice a week as formerly.
 
<p>The synod of New York and New Jersey erected a new presbytery in the northern part of this state, under the name of The <a href="../presbyterian.html">Presbytery</a> of Albany; to which they committed the care of all the congregations in this state in connection with them, which lie north of the Catskill mountains on the west side, and of the southern boundary of Columbia county on the east side of Hudson's river. It was appointed to meet for the first time on the ninth November, in the city of Albany; and to be opened with a sermon by Rev. William Schenck, the senior pastor. In the absence of Mr. Schenck, Rev. John Warford of Salem preached from Luke xiv, 23. Rev. John McDonald of Albany was appointed stated clerk.
 
<p>There were but two mails which reached the city of Albany at this time; one from New York, and the other from Springfield, Mass. (See vol. i, p. 56).
 
<p>The revenue of the city for six months preceding the twelfth October, was £918 16s. 10JZ.; the expenditures, £728 9s. Id. Among the expenditures is an item of £3 10s. paid constables for patrolling the streets on Sundays. £25 3s. 4d. was received of P. S. Van Rensselaer, for ground in Barrack street.
 
<p>December. The state of the weather is thus given for a part of this month:
<dd>8th. Thermometer indicated 4 degrees below 0.
<dd>9th. 10 deg. below 0; the barometer higher than had been observed in four years, and the weather colder for the season than had ever been known in the city. 
<dd>17th. 2° below 0. 
<dd>18th. 8 °
<dd>19th. 16° 
<dd>20th. 20° above 0.
<dd> 22d. 0°
<dd> 28th. 4° below 0.
 <dd>30th. 3°
<dd>31st. 8°
