<blockquote><p><font size=-1><b>T</b>he Journal and Copybook of <a href="../bios/y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a>, 1754-1758" is a notebook sized manuscript document and part of the "Abraham Yates, Jr. Papers" collection at the <a href="http://www.nypl.org/">New York Public Library</a>. It encompasses 180 manuscript pages - with text written carefully, scribbled in, corrected, and annotated. Yates appeared to have kept a journal and then edited and added to the document over a period of years.</font></p><font size=-1>

<p>Yates's journal coverning the years he served as <a href="../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany provides an intimate albiet biased perspective on conditions in Albany during the <a href="../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. It is an extremely valuable but largely overlooked historical resource.</p>

<p>In 1973, <a href="../bios/staff/sbbio.html">Stefan Bielinski</a> transcribed the document and re-organized it chronologically. He also began researching the persons, places, and events appearing in the manuscript. At that time, he considered editing and annotating it for separate publication. It is now a line-for-line typescript of 112 pages and is on file at the project office. The transcription also retains original spellings and punctuation. That line-for-line version <a href="../inprog.html">will be presented</a> below but arranged in strictly chronological order! Paragraphing has been supplied for coherence.</p>

<p>This document is the quintessential <a href="../cbr.html">community-based</a> and community-biased resource!</font></blockquote>

<p>1754 June And July - the <a href="../albanycongress.html">Great Congress</a> was held

<p>July 3th  The Corporation Gave Them a Dinner At the <a href="../loc/cityhall.html">City<br> 
hall</a> - the Corporation fund being Low <br>
The Commonality [funded] the dinner, out of their Own Pockets
<a name=cia></a>
<p>I Was Appointed Deputy Secretary of the <a href="../cia.html">Indian Affairs</a><br> In Which I Continued - for Ten Months When<br>
 they Were Superceeded by <a href="../bios/j/swj.html">Coll. Johnson</a> After <br>
the Commissioners of the Indian Affairs had <br>done the drudgery And brought the Indians on <br>
An Amicable footing - They renewed the Old <br>
Covenent With the Foive Nations - Settled a <br>
Neutrality With the Cagnewagoes & Annegungoes <br>
I think Myself Oblidge to Declare that What I <br>
have Observed in their Transactions has been <br>
honest And honorable -

<p>The Indian Affairs Was at this time in the hands of a Number <br>
of our most principel men. like as it Were Became Netterel to their <br>
Way by the friendship they had Contracted <br>
in the continuance of their Travels Among them <br>
They Acted by a Commission from our Governour, thus<br>
And kept a Mintute Of All their preceeding Copies<br>
Were Monthly Sent Down to the Governour and Council<br>
Their Manutes Gives a Categorical Account of All <br>
the Transactions With the Indians (if I Remember Wright) <br>
from the beginning of our Settlement <br>
it was there Business to treat with the Indians Receve their News <br>
And had 170 New York Currency, to Distribute Among them <br>
to Most Advantage

<p>In Perusing their Records I think is sufficient to Shew <br>
that they had a thorew Notion of the Affairs they Were entrusted <br>
With - The Repeated Information they have from time to time given <br>
of the Incroachment of the french, And their Intrigue to draw <br>
the Affections of the Indians from us, is Sufficient to Shew <br>
that they had the Wel being of their Country at heart, they Went by <br>
the Name of <a href="../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>, I know of no <br>
Interruption Until In Mr. Clintons' Troubles In the last <br>
War the Whole Management Was Given to Mr. Johnson <br>
Now Sir William Johnson, how fit Mr. Johnson Was for <br>
this Business I Cannot pretent to Judge nor had an <br>
Opportunity of proper Information, I was Under the Same <br>
Disadvantages With a _______ Except for a Space of Ten <br>
Months, have Acted As Deputy Secretary to that Board When <br>
I have had An opportunity of the Records Which Consist of <br>
4 Large folio Volumes With Some hundreds of Letters And other<br> 
papers, Some Very Usefull <br>
from July 1754 to May 1755 When Mr. Johnson Supperceeded <br>
them Again in the Sole Management, Why <br>
these Short Revolutions I do not know - but the - <br>
Commissioners Pretended to hardly Ever having been In the <br>
Possession of their offices I think Less then two years <br>
In which time they were gone throu the Drudgery of <br>
Settling all the Affairs Since the Beginning of the Last -<br>
- Concluded a Neutrality With the french Indians<br>
that in Case a War Should Brake out Between his most<br>
Gratious Majesty of Great Britain And the french king they <br>
were to remain Neuter, to Which I think his honour Alludes <br>
When Writes us not to Depend on the french Indians <br>
An Other thing I Cannot help to Observe <br>
(And for Which they Not only have been blamed <br>
by Some of the Neibouring Colonies, but Even by Some of <br>
our own Colony) these Gentlemen, Governed <br>
themselves According to the following Maxime that <br>
An Indian Will Either fite or trade And That the Only <br>
Way to keep them from fighting is by tradeing With them, <br>

<p>The governor of the Jersies Seems to be of the Same opinion<br>

<p>1754 August 20th</p>

<p>Just As the farmars Were Busy In their harvest<br>
<a href="../na/hoos.html">Hosack</a> Was Burned and Distroyd by a party<br>
of the Enemy, - two men only Were Killed - This we Looked upon As a Sufficient<br>
Warning to All our frontier places, Who made<br>
the Best of their Way to Safe themselves And Effects<br>
In the Same Manner As In the Other War, they<br>
Came to this City for Shelter, With their Effect<br>
Which In a Great Measure Doubled our families<br>
At the Same time our fortifications Were In a <br>
ruinous Condidtion, No fund to repair them With <br>
upwards of 1,000 pounds Indebted Since the Last War<br>
We Went by turns procured and Set the Stockadoes <br>
his honour Liut. Governour Delancey <Br>
Sent us a letter as a Warning to procure Stockadoes And <br>
repair the Blockhouses - - <br>

<p>The Corporation Answer th honours that We We already Busy<br>
of procuring And Setting the Stockadoes<br>

not Car if the fella Was to Set there to Eternity<br>
that he only Would not have a Magistrate to think<br>
