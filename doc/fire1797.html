<p>From <a href="../books.html#ac"><i>Albany Chronicles</i></a>: On August 4, 1797 a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA355&lpg">fire</a> destroyed fifty houses on Montgomery, Dock, Steuben, North Market (Broadway), Columbia and Middle Lane (James street). 

<p>Subsequent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_New_York_in_the_18th_century#cite_note-LC-1">newspaper</a> accounts described the damages in more detail. What follows has been adapted from the <a href="#cent"><i>Albany Centinel</i></a> for August 1797.</p>
	  
<p>On Friday night last, a little before eleven o'clock the inhabitants of this city were alarmed with the cry of fire, which broke out in a stable belonging to the <a href="../bios/vn/cavness878.html">widow A. Bradt</a>, in Montgomery Street, and not withstading the [________] displayed by the citizens to check its progress, was soon communicated to the adjacent buildings; the wind blew fresh from the southeast, and great apprehensions were entertained for the fate of no inconsiderable part of the city: the misery &  distress concomitant on this dreadful calamity can be more easily conceived than deseribed.

<p>Eighty-three dwelling-houses were burnt and a number of others much injured-forty-nine storehouses and workshops, and eighty stables were destroyed, a greater part by the flames - a few were taken down to obstruct the spreading of the terrible element. It is said theat nearly one thousand persons are driven from the friendly roofs which protected them previous to this distressing accident. The wine and oil of charity we trust will be administered, with a ready hand, to the necessitous.

<p>The officers of the city, and the inhabitants in general, merit applause for their melancholy occasion.

<p>Gratitude and praise is due to our brethren of Troy, <a href="../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>, Bath, and the citizens in our vicinity in general, for their ready and active co-operation with the inhabitants of Albany to impede the ravages of the fire. So great were the exertions of the citizens of Troy, as we have been informed, that they appeared at the scene of distress at a very early period after the fire broke out. 

<p>We dare not attempt to mention the amount of Property destroyed by the unforrtunate accident, as no accurate calculation has yet been made, nor do we think it early to ascertain it. We do not hefitate however to pronounce th loss greater than ever has been experienced in this City by fire. 

<p>The following is the list of buildings destroyed, of the persons owning the property, and by whom the buildings were occupied, according to the information we have been able to collect: if errors are contained in the statement, we will thank our friends to enable us to correct them.
