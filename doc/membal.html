<br>

<p><b>On</b> July 2, 1782, Alderman <a href="../bios/y/pwyates.html">Peter W. Yates</a> of Albany presented to President <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Stiles">Stiles</a> a request for advice in procuring two "preceptors" for the <a href="../org/albacad.html">Albany Academy</a>. This had been founded two years before, and was under the <a href="../corporation.html">government</a> of the city authorities, though partly supported by private subscriptions. On Dr. Stiles' recommendation, <a href="../bios/b/sibaldwin.html">Mr. Baldwin</a> and <a href="../bios/l/jolovett.html">John Lovett</a> of Lisbon, a member of the graduating class, were engaged, at a salary for each of "&pound;150, York money silver." In Stiles' diary for July 5, 1782, this is minuted, with the addition of "Deduct Board & Wash^ &pound; 100 Dolls per Ann. leaves &pound;110." 

<p><font size=-1>There was no time to consult his father, but shortly after accepting the position he wrote home about it and received the following replies from his father and stepmother. They show the good sense and piety of each.</font size> 

<p>"Norwich July 18 1782 

<p>"Dear child my kind Love and affection to you wishing of you well I Received yours informing me that you have ingaged to go to Albany to keep a School their, being ingaged tis too late to give my advice about going I fear it is a place whair you will meat with much bad compiny now my advice is to shun all bad compani as much as posabal which many times brings a snare on young people kep the fear of god before your eyes and all Days remembr that you are acountabel to god for every action don hear in the body I pray to god for you that he will protect and defend you from the snairs of the world and bring you to the knowlig of himself and to embrace Jesus Christ as ofred in the gospel Senc you are ingaged to goo I make no obgacton i hope it may doe well We are in as good a State of health as youself [87]  I hope you will write as often as you can being at such a grait Distanc so I Subscrib your affectianant father Eben Baldwin" 

<p>"Dear child I am very sorry your Lott is cast att so grate a distance from home but I hope you have consedered the matter well and taken the best advise and I know there is the same god to protect you there as hear whose devine direction I pray you may have in all your ways and may your Life and health be precious in his sight to whose care I Recommend you and Remain your Loveing mother 
<br>Esther Baldwin." 

<p>At the same time, his sister Bethia writes him that she does not like his going such a distance from home as to Albany, but she finds there is a post-rider from there to Bennington, Vermont, and so they may hope to have news of his doings from time to time by mail. 

<p>The general practice of those days to send letters by private hands was due to the paucity and irregularity of the <a href="../org/po.html">post office</a> service, quite as much as the high cost of postage. Letters frequently miscarried, and when money was enclosed, it was at considerable risk of losing it. The mails were chiefly carried by post-riders, on horseback.<b>^</b> 

<p>Albany at this time had four or five thousand inhabitants, and had been incorporated as a city for nearly a hundred years. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedidiah_Morse">Jedediah Morse</a>, in the second volume of his "<a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009713242">American Geography</a>," published in 1792, gives a description of it, from which the following extracts are taken. 

<p>"As great a variety of languages are spoken in Albany, as in any town in the United States. Adventurers, in pursuit of wealth, are led here by the advantages for trade which this 
place affords. . . . 

<p>Albany is said to be an unsociable place. This is naturally to be expected. A heterogeneous collection of people, 

<p><b>^</b><font size=-1> Stiles, <i>Literary Diary</i>, II, 54. See ante, pages 38, 42, 51 ; post page 424. </font size>

<p>[88] invested with all their national prejudices, eager in the pursuit of gain, and jealous of a rivalship, cannot expect to enjoy the pleasures of social intercourse, or the sweets of an inti- 
mate and refined friendship. . . .
 
<p>To form a just idea of the manners and customs of the inhabitants, we must confine ourselves to the <a href="../nnd.html">Dutch</a>, who being much the most numerous, give the tone to the manners of the place. Two things unite more particularly to render these disagreeable to foreigners; first, a natural prejudice which we all possess in favour of our own, and against the manners of another place or nation: secondly, their close union, like the Jews of old, to prevent the innovation of foreigners, and to keep the balance of interest always in their hands. 
<p>
It is an unhappy circumstance when an infant nation adopts the vices, luxuries and manners of an old one; but this was in a great measure the case with the first settlers of Albany, most of whom were immediately from Amsterdam. Their diversions are walking and sitting in meadhouses, and in mixed companies they dance. They know nothing of the little plays and amusements common to small 
social circles. The gentlemen who are lively and gay, play at cards, billiards, chess, &c. others go to the tavern, mechanically, at eleven o'clock, stay until dinner, and return in the evening. It is not uncommon to see forty or fifty at these places of resort, at the same time; yet they seldom drink to intoxication, unless in company, or on public occasions,when it is thought to be no disgrace.
 
<p>Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Lovett rode to Albany on horseback. The following copy of a journal kept by the former<b>*</b> gives quite a full account of his journey there and the year that followed it. 

<p><b>*</b><font size=-1>A large part of this journal is embodied in a paper entitled "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0dMLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA193&lpg=PA193&dq=%22Young+Man's+Journal+of+a+Hundred+Years+Ago%22&source=bl&ots=fuS0l05rJ7&sig=K5cn30Y_AywnradMJT37FBo5z3o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW3NHRlPbPAhXMFT4KHe2mBXUQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=%22Young%20Man's%20Journal%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Years%20Ago%22&f=false">A Young Man's Journal of a Hundred Years Ago</a>," read in 1884 by Simeon E. Baldwin before the New Haven Colony Historical Society and published in its Papers, Vol. IV, 193.</font size> 

<p>[89]  Journal No. I 

<p>This gloomy Day saw me bid adieu to the happy Aug. 5th Circle of my Intimates at New Haven & set out on a journey from that to Albany, (in company with John Lovett) to take with him the charge of their <a href="../org/albacad.html">academic school</a> & The thoughts of leaving friends with whom I had spent so many of the social hours in the most agreeable manner & of some of 
them to whom I was bound by the strongest ties of Affection, could not be otherwise than disagreeable. & And the prospect of forming new acquaintance in a place where the maners of the people were so very different from those to which I had ever been accustomed - & which was ever represented to me as the most horrid place of Nature, flled me with anxiety & uneasy reflections. 

<p>Harrassed with these feelings, but otherwise agreeably we passed thro Waterbury where we heard the agreeable News of the arrival of the french fleet of 13 Sail in Chesapeak. - Wood 
of Danbury favoured us with the intelligence & we saw Litchfield the next morning found it a pretty well situated Town. Land very good & Anf farmers wealthy - brokefast at Mr. Shermans<b>^</b> of Goshen & after breakfast were favoured with the presence of the most angelic form in a female that ever I saw. the features of her face were regular & well formed & her skin like the paper on which I write, animated with a little of the Vermillion & her Lips which it would be a feast for an Emperor to kiss & displayed the tast of the divine Architect who formed them in a more lively maner than words can express or the most celebrated painter display. And without the thoughts of flattery, if any thing performed by mortals is inimitable, it was the dressing of her hair : it covered her Cushion as a plate

We called on Burral* & he was from home, went on to Sheffield, a pretty little country Town & slept that night at an old Dutchman's near the foot of the mountains of Nobletown & which we passed the next morning on our way to <a href="../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>; dined in the plain between that & Greenbush & crossed the river about Sunset enquired for <a href="../bios/d/hdenniston5136.html">Dennisons</a> were met there by <a href="../bios/y/pwyates.html">Mr. Yates</a>, who politely insisted on our spending the night with him & went to <a href="../bios/b/abbgd7351.html">Bloodgood's</a>; fill'd the circle with Aug news & supt at Denisons on fish, with John & Kilian <a href="../bios/vr/vr.html">Ranselear</a> : slept at Mr. Yates

<p>After Breakfast walked round the <a href="../im/im1770.html">City</a>: found many streats agreeable, but in others the smell was most intolerable, few of them are paved & they in 
general the most filthy: dined, supt, & Slept again at Mr. Yates. After Breakfast set out for <a href="../bios/w/ewesterlo.html">Domine Westerlo'</a>s, met him on the road, delivered our Let- 
ters & received a polite invitation to dine with him & were engaged, but by his desire promised to do ourselves the Honor of waiting on him at Tea & delivered our Letters to the <a href="../bios/b/jojabeekman3866.html">Mayor</a> who treated us politely & Dined at <a href="../bios/h/rhenry8425.html">Mr. Henry</a>s a most agreeable family in company with <a href="#jmk">Mr. M McKesson</a> an attorney & tarried till after Tea & rode with Mr. Yates in a carriage to the D.[?] took tea again spent a Sociable Afternoon, were much pleased with the grandieur of the <a href="../na/vrmh.html">patron's seat</a> where the Domine Lived, returned to Mr. Yates & Slept - next day Saturday 

<p>[91] Next day Saturday: did not go out till afternoon & saw nothing  remarkable except that we were visited by <a href="../bios/vr/svr3.html">Stephen</a> & <a href="../bios/vr/kvr5092.html">K. V. Ransselear</a> 

<p>Sabbath 11th: The first thing I <a href="../im/imspearldiag.html#3">saw</a> from my window was the <a href="../trades/meat.html">butchers</a> & killing sheep & boys driving their Hoops  & soon after the Waggons were ratling, this at once led me to a thought  upon virtue & morality which as far as it comes to my share I am determined to maintain &#151; as I see myself exposed to temptation & surrounded by examples of this kind will endeavour to double my vigilence in my virtues defence & went to worship in the dutch church but contrary to our expectation the Domine preached & performed the whole service in Dutch to our no great edification & In the afternoon the Domine favoured us with a very good sermon in English upon temptation &#151; & at 5 o Clock heard <a href="#catlin">Mr. Catlin</a> preach a most inspired discourse from the grain of corn that died 

<p>Mond. Aug. 12 Albany: This day <a href="../org/albacad.html">entered upon the business of our School</a> our Number in the forenoon was 31; a Collection (taken together) of as likely look'd Lads as ever I saw ... in afternoon near 40 & to our surprize saw Merwin & Williams & walked with them to Jack Ransselears were amused with the sight of a very fine horse which here affords the people the grandest entertainment & supt at M' Philip ransslears were treated very politely [13th]  Merwin & Williams left us, I wrote a line to Doct. Goodrich & sent his horse & & another short Line for the first to my Dulcinea & spent the day in School; are still much pleased with our Pupils & but at times of reflection cant but turn a thought on the happy Circle of my Intimates in N. England with whom I have spent so many sociable hours &#151;

<p> [92]

<p> but Stay my complaints! I am I hope improving & even from this & as I shall know how to valine the blessing when I enjoy it (if ever) again. Yet Heavens! O Amanda what would I give for 
another such happy evening & a return of those sweet Kisses which I enjoyed when last I saw you & last night Lovett & myself had the honour of an Invitation to spend the Evening with the 
Commonalty were obliged to beg ourselves excused for our Company's sake (i e Merwin & Wil) but by their desire agreed to spend this Eve with the Subscribers;^ went accordingly to Bloodgood's 
tavern spent the Eve & pretty sociably & drank our fill from the bowl of plenty which moved round the Dutchified Circle as fast as the unwillingness of the machine & their natural heaviness (for all things else) would admit . 

<p>Friday 16th Dined with <a href="../bios/t/abtbroeck6.html">Gen. Ten Broeck</a> in company with Gansevoort Esq the recorder Dom. Westerlo Col. Levingston, Mess" Steven & Killion Ransselear & a grander Table I never saw Spread & much politeness & Ease were manifest & the whole Circle appeared to enjoy themselves happily & Drank for toast

<p>left the Table about 3 O Clock

<p>Albany Sat. 17th, 1782 
<p>Entered into Conversation this Day with Mr. Yates, upon the Study of the Law & he gave me to read Simpson upon the Study of it, an Ingenious piece & 

 <p> [93] In the forenoon remained at home & in the Aft. went to the <a href"../drc.html">high-Dutch-Church</a> & in Expectation of an EngHsh Sermon but was disappointed & was much entertained with Organs, which I now heard for the first time & think it a great addition to the beauty & Grandeur of church music. & 

<p>This day began the Study of the Law, with Wood's institutes & Jacobs Gram. & 

<p>Nothing extraordinary this Week am much confined & have not as yet been introduced to a single Young Lady, & for want thereof was last night obliged to kiss table Spoons; ^^mzdined this day 
upon bread & buttermilk for the first time . . After dinner were favoured with the Company of Col. Nichol & Jack Ransslaer &c & The afternoon heard Dom. Westerlo deliver a very excellent 
disourse from Rom. 14: 7 & 8. 

<p>Have employed myself this day almost entirely in writing Letters to friends in New England & read but little & Introduced to no Company & except that Yesterday dined with the Domine, with 
Col. Duer^^ & M'' Lansing & Table was furnished with much elegance & a fine Dinner & spent the Evening agreably at Dr. Youngs & with his & his sisters agreeable conversation & the animating 
music of his Violin & drank Tea on Monday at M'' Henry's & This day (Sat.) Lovett left me to the Toils of the whole school & while he enjoys the pleasures of Com*. Now IVe a glorious time for 
drooping Melancholy, & never satisfying reflection. & endeavoured however to divert myself by Hunting in company with M"" Yates & Nisher came home much fatigued & with very little game 

<p>A. M. heard Dom. W. preach an excellent sermon from these words "The just shall live by faith" & feel unhappy tho' perhaps from no better prin [94] ciple than conformity to Custom, that I cant, this P. M. took tea at M^ Teabout a clever old Gentleman with M" Yates Graham &c & spent the Evening agreeably at M"" Phil. Rensselear; supt there & with M'" Morris his Sister & Miss Betty Sanders . . . 

<p>Sept 4 This day sent a Letter to Lovett, never was more 1782 dejected in Spirit in my Life & a laborious Schoolmate gone & M'" Yates gone & & I alone in the midst of a Thousand & & never (I begin to think) was a more disagreeable place & or one where it was more difficult to form an intimacy with any one & for this appears to be the principle of their Action & the extent of their Politeness, that if a stranger of good family & fortune & very agreeable will be pleased to introduce & & push himself into Company & will oblige them to sociability & make them agreeable to themselves & they will suffer him to stay & possibly he may be welcome & You may be as intimate as friendship will allow, with the Young Gentlemen & never hear the name of a Lady or their desire to introduce you, or wish to increase your acquaintance & such manners I never was acquainted with before, & hope I never may experience them again. & In the afternoon rode to divert myself but without Company & went upon the <a href="../na/schuylerflats.html">flatts</a>, to Maj. Schyler's & very agreeable & hospitable Man. treated me kindly lamented the manners of the People &c invited me to frequent his house &c . . in the evening spent a few minutes with the Ladies at Phil. Rensselaer. & Sab. 8*1^ Afternoon heard Domine Westerlo preach Sept. Walked in the Evening but found no Company & look & feel like a sheep deprived of its mates & placed among beast unknown to it. & Monday Begun with Col. Burr's son to instruct him in the 9 Languages. & went to the Domines found him not at home & visited by K. V. Ren loth This morning a little lowry, rain*d some, windy all day & very cloudy & high wind this Eve which 

<p> [95] I observe the more as it precedes the pleasures of Com^ at N Haven wh^ I am not only deprived the pleasure of enjoying but was almost obliged to do the duty of a watch in this detested City & was warned, but for 2/6 procured a substitute. & was invited to a funeral, attended, but not a Dutch corpse & many persons were collected & the corps preceded, born of 10 persons who were not relieved, tho' we went to some distance & the Gentlemen fell in by twos in procession, but not a single Lady tho' it was a female Corpse & the whole returned in the order they went & & took their glass of wine with the mourners, agreeable to the universal Custom of the place & which I understand is drank in proportion to the character & fortune of the dead.

<p> Had no School in the forenoon & was most of 1782 the Day <i>in mente at N H. et totus in ipsa</i> ; in the afternoon weather favourable & & a most glorious Evening for Dancing.

<p> [Albany Sept. 16 Sabbath] Heard Dom Westerlo preach an excellent Discourse upon the merits of Christ & his Righteousness & Dined with M'' Henry as M'' Yates & his Lady were gone up the river. & spent the afternoon at home in reading the divine Sentiments of the Phylosophic Seneca. & in the evening visited Alderman Huss & & supt at Gen. Ten Broecks, as his Son had this day returned from N Haven .... 

<p>Sat^ My school in the Absence of Mr. Lovett is so exceedingly laborious that really It has quite exhausted my spirits & almost ruined my health: 
<dd>4 an hour before Breakfast with Provo Burr; 
<dd>enter School at 9, seldom finish the morning recitation till near 11. 
<dd>from that to 12 too short for the noon restation & then till 1 o Clock with Burr again, have one hour for diner, 
<dd>then from 2 till 5 in a laborious & numerous School & & then read till II
<dd> at Night; the Day time I devote to the Languages, the Evening to the Study of the Law & [96] this has been my tiresome round for 3 Weeks past</dd> 

<p> &#151; rode in the afternoon with Mr. Yates to Maj. Schylers spent a most agreeable afternoon & found Lovett at home on my return, was very glad to see him & receive some very agreeable Letters, but was especially animated by ONE.  


<p>Sab Did not go to meeting & was a little unwell. ^ Supt at Mr. P. Renselear's with Col. Rensselaer from Cloverac, a very lively & agreeable Man, 

<p>23 Brother Lovett left me, & takes lodgings at M' Lansings, a curious scene opened the way to it. & fryday In the Evening visited the Domine - find my Veneration increases for him evrry time I see him. & & was really almost tempted to wish myself behind the Door. 

<p>29 Rode in company with Messrs. Lovett, Ten Broeck & Rensselaer to see the falls at Cahos upon the Mohawk river, 12 miles from Albany. & the ride is agreeable the country a plain, even the tops of the banks of the very easy descent of a mile before Level with the of the fall is but none of it 

<p>(A pen and ink sketch of the falls comes here. [not included])


<p>river have but a runing near half they come to the river & the height about 25 yards & quite Perpendicular & tho' the jutting banks were almost perfectly so & & to the height of more than 100 feet according to my opinion. & the water was low so that above the falls we might have walked accross without wetting our feet & & the little streams that purled down the lofty rocks, amid the more rough & boisterous Sluices, formed a most beautiful variety in the Grandeur of the prospect The river was not at all confined but of the two rather wider in this than other places & the bottom above & below appeared to be of one entire rock, but of the soft Slate kind, & in many places curiously wrought upon by the water, into holes & crevices of various Depths & shapes. & 

<p> [97] Went to church in the forenoon heard (as) usual a most excellent Sermon from a Text in Isaiah delivered by the Dom. dined with the Mayor, in company with a Mr. Sawyer from Boston; had a fine dinner. As the exercises were Dutch, did not go to church. At 4 o Clock we went to the <a href="../lutheran.html">German-Church</a> & were entertained for an hour after Meeting with the animating music of the Organs & drank Tea at the Mayors & walked home & But I must make this reflection & (that tho' the time would have been most happily spent were it any other Day of the  week) it was not perfectly consistent with the more agreeable Rules of Christianity & tho perfectly consonant to the manners of the place . . . 

<p>It is also Election-day for the Aldermen & officers <a href="../corporation.html">of the City</a> & accordingly they repaired for the purpose to the <a href="../loc/cityhall.html">City-Hall</a> soon after Church & Spent an agreeable Evening at Mr. Henry's ; supt with them & in consequence of it am very unwell; did not go to School. 

<p>This morning am troubled with a pain in my Breast. walked a mile or two & felt it a little removed & attended School in the Afternoon, unwell still & in the Evening went to see Dr. Young but he was not at home & returned to my Chamber & relieved my Stomack from a heavy disagreeable Load & upon which the Dr. made me a visit & left an Emettic, which I took early the next morning & find a great relief.

<p>Dined at the Domine Westerlo's; had a very good dinner; but great many disagreeable lattin proverbs, which he is very fond of exhibiting with all the Airs of pedantry, & not without reflections 
& I esteem him as a divine & a man well versed in the Languages, but further than this cannot say that I do. & He is fond of their European Education & seems to dispise ours & He certainly transgresses the rules of politeness by introducing

<p> [98] so much of his Latin upon evry occasion, especially as he knows that from his manner of pronunciation it cannot be clearly intelligible & consequently must be disagreeable, to those he converses with & And it appears to me that he does it from a principle which Chesterfield condemns (i, e,) to make others appear as diminutive as possible to themself; 
that they may entertain an exalted Idea of his superior Learning & He even exercised the Pedantry (Til call it by no worse name) to attempt to examine me in the Greek Testament, which I took 
the liberty to refuse: & was not a little out of temper & could perceive I was not alone & He then mentioned that the word was appa^o<;, without seem, which I did not look upon, for tho I knew 
I could construe that, yet I knew also there were many others which I could not, especially as he was curious in the Themes & nor again would I submit to an examination from any man upon such an 
occasion & before such Company & But I find that this is his pretty general practice; and upon my word it is some comfort to me that others understand him no better than I do & Am determined 
however to scour up what little I know of the Mathematics, Rhetoric, History, &c that if Tm attacked again with his lattin balls I may return the fire with Triangles, Tropes, huperboles &c which 
I understand he is not much acquainted with & when I have another engagement Til write more. & tarried there till after Tea when Mess" Steven & Phil. V. Rensselaer accompanied Lovett, Tenbroeck 
& myself into Town ....

<p>Sabbath A. M. read till I was tired, & then took a long [Sept 6,1782] serious, & solitary walk & was accompanied at diner by Mr. Lovett & two other Gentlemen one of them an agreeable officer & the impoliteness of our family which disgusted me now more than ever did not suffer our landlord to introduce either of us & I'm sure it was noticed by the officer & it certainly

p>[99]  made us feel disagreeably & after diner we went to meeting- & heard the Domine preach upon the merits of Christ & the necessity of our faith in him & Passed the Evening agreeably at Mr. Henrys who Tuesday took the trouble to initiate me a little in the Game of Backgammon.

<p>Agreed to accompany Mr. Lovett upon a visit 9 down the river to Col. Nicolls & was put to much trouble in obtaining a horse, till M' Scuyler obliged me with his & sat out about 2 o'clock & rode fast till near 4 o Clock when we found we were in a wrong road & near 1 Mile below his house & but it was some compensation that after the roughness of our wrong, woodsy path, we had a most beautiful canter, to his house, along the river, upon an exceeding smoth plain of Interval. & Tea was just ready & we were affectionately welcomed to partake of it & spent the afternoon happily & had an excellent farmers Supper, the fat of the Land were late to bed & consequently did not git up till 8 o Clock; nor would they suffer us to go till after Breakfast tho we were obliged to ride 8 miles & attend the Academy by 9 o Clock & we breakfasted & bid good by & & mounted by 20 minutes past 8 . . . . 

<p>The Col. appears to be a person of a very generous make & open hearted & hospitable, sensible and exceeding amiable Gentleman & & the old Lady his wife seems to vie with him in evry excellence & They have but 2 children a Son & a Daughter who is now at Boston, I never saw her & but his Son bids fair to unite in himself the excellence of both his parents & The Estate of the family is very great they have a most noble farm & of the best kind which the country affords & they are seated in the midst of it, but a few rods from the North river & live in a small, but yet elegant house & seem to enjoy the 

<p>[1OO] pleasures of their Wealth. The scene is almost romantic & What situation does the Stage of Life afford, that is more pleasing. & Free from Envy, free from Strife The Curst destroyers of our Life. 

<p>We dismounted at the Door of our Academy 25 Minutes after 9 & found we had been but one hour & 5 minutes in riding the 8 Miles. Dined accidentally at Mr. Scuylers .... 

<p>In the Evening were invited to sup with some of the Town Gentlemen at Schuylers; sign, Gen Green Mr. Van Neghten accompanied us, were introduced to two Mess" Lansings & a M'' Briskey a modest young Man from the Jersey, Hackinsack. these with Mess" Graham, Lovett, 2 Ten Broecks & myself made the Circle & Cards were introduced I had the good fortune to join in a table of Whist which we made very agreeable while the others 
exercised themselves with the most disagreeable of 
Games, Whackets, which they made so ridiculously 
noisy that it was disgusting. & We sat down to 
supper about 10 o. C. Before us were oysters & a 
good Turkey & made a comfortable Supper & but 
the wine was most miserably bad, so that no one 
was tempted to drink it to excess. & After Supper 
a musician was called & we had an all-cheese-romp- 
ing-Dance & Capt. Guion joined us before we had 
done & another officer Graham I think & some 
apologies were made for the noise tho 'twas said 
nothing hapned, but what was perfectly consonant 
to the manners & Customs of the place & tho in 
New England it would be called a pretty high take 
& we left the House about 12 o C. I slept with 
my friend Lovett & Breakfasted at home which 
I had not done for 5 meals & was not a little 
pleased to find the family & so alarmed that they 
were quite softened into Honey & Pie & In the 
Evening attended a Court at Dennisons twas a 

<p> [101] Jury of Inquest upon an interlocutory Order or 
Judgment & the Sheriff presided & but as he was 
not a competent Judge of Law, the cavils of the 
Lawyers & the Demurrers brought to his decision 
made it a confused Court & they began at 1 1 a. m. 
examined witnesses & Accounts till 8 after N. plead 
till half after ten & gave their Verdict at 12 o Clock 
& Col. Troup plead for the defendant & I think 
bids fair for a capital character as this was his 
second plea & 

<p>Got up from Breakfast Table 5 minutes before 1 1 Sabath 
o Clock & this I suppose would be the case evry ^^ 
day were they at perfect liberty, but they are sensible 
that I must commonly be at School by 9 o, CI. & in 
consequence after much Noise, a great deal of 
Scolding on their side, & a shade of determination 
on mine, we frequently sit down by 5 minutes before 
9 . . . Tis sacrament to Day for that reason 
our English Service is in the Afternoon heard a 
M"" Morison preach in the Presbyterian house & his 
Sermon was full of Scripture, & good exhortation, 
but without any connection with his text as is the 
Case with most extempore preachers & after 
service was called to my window by the horrid 
swearing of two Negroes who were fighting most 
inhumanly & 50 or more Spectators were soon col- 
lected to see the beastly scene. I could not but 
reflect upon it with pain, that human Nature could 
divest themselves of the Dignity of our Species, 
& take the revenge & perform the Actions which 
ought to be peculiar to the most malicious of the 
brutal race & spent part of the Evening very agreeably at M'' 
Gansevoorts, the Sheriff Tenbroack came in, a very 
agreeable Man & We walked to M' Lansings & 
supt with him & all were exceeding sociable . . . 

<p>Rose from Breakfast more than half past 9 a. m. Monday & to do this was obliged to call for it myself & sit down alone & heard some observe as I past them 

<p> [102] upon my late hour at School & really tho' I ever keep my hours, it makes me feel disagreeable to walk the streets so late & for people seldom make the suitable allowance It was apparent that I was disgusted in the morning, & to make some compensation we dined % after one o C. & Intended to have walked out this Eve but the rain disappointed me. Was ordered to be ready at a minutes 
warning, to march to the frontiers as twas rumoured the Enemy, were upon the Lake or Mohawk river & so to add to the disagreeables of my situation I am obliged to perform military Duty as the Legislature of the State of New York seem never to have thought the promotion of Literature an object worthy their attention & consequently no privaleges are allowed or favour shown to those who have spent their time & fortune in the pursuit of it & A Disposition much the reverse is manifest in the liberal provision made by the Legislature of the State of Connecticut. & 

<p>Tuesday This Eve Mr. Lovett & myself sup'd at Mr. Scuylers 

^5*^ spent the time exceeding sociably, tarried till 11 o'clock. 

i6 In the afternoon attended Court & the Cause was an Action of Trespass & Mr. Yates & Bray were the opposing Attorneys & Y. spoke exceeding fluently, with a great deal of ease & discovers much 
knowledge of the Law & B, was much embarassed & seems to have Ideas but no words, he lost his Cause. 

<p> 17th The 5th Aniversary since the Capture of Burgoin rained, & but little parade in the Celibration. & Sat Afternoon attended Court & An Indictment for Riot was tried & the Party found Guilty, no pleadings spent the Eve with Graham. Van veghten two Lansings &c were there & supt with them at D Schuylers as it was the aniversary of the surrender of Cornwallis 

<p> A. M. heard the Dom. preach, John 17*^ 19*^ . . . 20 

<p> [103] Judge Hubbard Hobart & Attorney General <a href="../bios/b/egbenson.html">Benson</a> & M' McKesson Clerck & Col. Varnek Fork dined with us & M'' Gilbert came in while at dinner & spent the Afternoon with me & about sunset we walked with Mr. Yates & fell in at Lovetts Chamber & & from that took Tenbroeck & went to the Sheriff Tenb. & spent the Evening sociably with a Mr. Banker supt there, came home about 10 o Clock & spent the remainder of the Eve in filling up my Diary & 

<p>Were obliged to sup at Col. Corchran's he is a 
man of little Education, some sense & a great deal 
of Vanity. & the rest of the family so, so & 

<p>Heard our Pupils rehearse a Tragedy preparing for Quarter. & Was Introduced to Miss S. Lansing a very amiable young Lady & drank Tea with her spent the Eve at Court & heard Judge Morriss give his opinion upon a Cause, very full, in his charge to the jury & their Verdict was given according to his, as it appeared, prejudiced charge. & 

<p>Dined with Alderman Hun. The Mayor, Dom, Stephen & Phil. V Rens^ D TBroeck & M'^ Lovett were present, very good Diner & Dom. had not 
so many Lattin proverbs as usual .... 

Took Tea at Col. Corchrans, heard the Tragedy 
rehearsed again. . . . Slept with M' Lovett. & 

In the afternoon attended Court & as it was the 
last day of the Term, the Judgments were declared 
& Sentences given, among others two were con- 
victed of stealing & they upon their knees plead 
the benefit of clergy, which exempted them from 
Death the Valine of the things stolen being under 
10 Â£. They were branded on the left Thumb in 
presence of the Court & dismissed. & 

Afternoon attended Church. & In the Evening 
walked to M"" Bloodgoods; as Miss Lansing was 
sitting in their stoop she introduced me to Miss 
Lydia VanVeghten, we went into the House: 


<p>Monday 21, 22, 23, Thursday 24, Fryday 25th, Sat. 26, Sab 27 

<p> [I04] 

conversation was pretty lively and agreeable till the 
Company was increased by some elderly Gentlemen, 
Lawyers &c. they had a pretty Learned Gent""" 
discourse on one side of the Room, while a M"" 
Banker engrossed the Ladies to himself on the other 

& & I, in the midst, joined neither & as I tho't my 
Design in visiting was principally to the Ladies I 
thought my attention ought principly to be paid to 
them, while they & the M"" B., as I tho't impolitely, 
not only introduced a Subject which they knew me 
to be unacquainted with, as it respected Company 
matters, & not only so, but ornamented it with the 
grace of a little Dutch diction interspersed. They 
saw I took it ill & made some vigorous attempts to 
introduce a Subject in which I might join them & 
but all they could say was & How do you like 
Albany f Have you ever been to Schenectada? 
'tis a beautiful Town &c &c. supt about 9 o Clock 

& shifted my position got among the Ladies & made 
conversation a little more agreeable & walked with 
Miss S. Lansing & 

Mond After School visited the Sheriff T Broeck spent 

th a pretty agreeable Evening, supt about 10 o Clock. 

29 After School visited at M" S Cuylers, then at M' 

Huns & ended with another to Miss S L-g & L. 
Van V-n was there & K-n V R-r & C. Ten Broeck : 
spent the Eve very sociably & very agreeably ; supt 
about 10 o Clock walked home with Miss L. V., bid 
them goed-enau Laster 

30. Spent the afternoon in the Academy hearing the Lads rehearse & in the Evening visited Alderman Schuyler & he is a pretty sensible Man & had no great Education & but a most tenatious Memory : 
came home at 8 & found a Miss Trunicliff with my Landlady, supt with her. she appears to have the command of a good many words, but withal very vain. I walked with her to her Lodgings, but Fm 
sure 'twas no great pleasure, for it rained hard, so that the streets were most abominably muddy &#151;

<p> [105] they inform me this is entailed upon it from this Time 'till the return of another Summer. & The Soil is of a heavy Kind easily affected by a small rain, & tho' the Sides of the Streets are in general paved, yet they are so very dirty that 'tis worse walking even on them than on the ground itself in most other Towns; add to this the water constantly pouring from the Spouting Gutters & Tm sure they are enough to give one a prejudice against the place. & 

<p>Began again with young Provosts Instruction. & 
In the Evening walked out with V. Veghten to M' 
Bloodg. to his namesake Lydia; spent the Eve 
sociably & she is a person of Modesty, not very 
deep, nor much read, of a pretty good & mild dis- 
position, & very affable & supt at 10 o Clock 
&c 

<p>Spent the Eve at M" Henries, M"" Lovetts & at 
the post office & & Sat. afternoon in rehersing with 
our Lads, & too Tea with M"" Gillilan & promised 
to dine there on Sabbath. 

<p>Breakfasted before I went to Church. & The Dom. preached from i^* of Isaiah lyth Come let us 
reason together &c & dined at M'' Gillilans with a 
pretty agreeable company of his friends, not with 
so much brilliancy as is seen at some of the Dutch 
Tables. & He is an Irishman & came into the 
country young, traded at N York till he acquired 
a fortune, this he employed in the purchase of 
Lands upon Lake Champlain. & He entered them 
when a forest. Had got a beautiful seat well culti- 
vated & more than 50 families settled & when he 
was drove from it & all burnt by the fate of War & 
He is now at Albany with his family, is a sensible 
man; has many curious turns Has an extensive 
acquaintance & a pretty good knowledge of human 
Nature & very hospitable, frank & open in his 
manners & 

Lieu* Thomson joined us at Tea & walked then  

<p> [106] to the patrons, stop at the ail-house & on our way home at M'' Watrous to see some Ladies & did not tarry long 

Mond. took Tea at Judge Yates, Col Throup was there 

4 laughed heartily & had most of the conversation & 

The Judge is a sensible, humoursome sociable, witty 
& agreeable man, not very haughty & but little for 
show & his wife upbraided him for his want of 
tast in dress when young, She is a Woman of great 
Spirits, high Notions, & not very neat, can swear a 
little now and then on occasion .... 

5**^ At the desire of a Lady (which cannot be denied consistent with the rules of Gallantry) we consented that Miss P. Floyd with two other Ladies should be admitted to our rehearsal, as she wished much to hear Miss Yates, & was going out of town before the exhibition, but to our surprize the room was crowded, with spectators, and party thro' accident & partly from the officiousness of K - n V.R - r while we had no scenery & dress, or apparatus, one of our principle Characters gone & but the 3** or 
4*^ time of rehearsing & however they went thro' 
& the whole was crown'd zmth a capshief of Albany 
politeness x x x x x deest x x x x x [sic] very happily 
escaped being led into a beastly scene of wedding 
debauchery increased by the arbitrary power of a 
Dictator & which is but a customary visit to the 
Groom the day after Marriage & per. Gr - m Esq & 

Wednesday Quite unwell with a very severe cold. & M' 

6*^ Yates gone & his as cross as the Devil, using 

evry Mean to disoblige me, & desending so low in 

some little matters of boarding, as 'twould disgrace 

my pen & Journal to write them 

Thursday 7 Spent the Evening very sociably at M' Henry 

8 Took Tea with Lovett & came home, M" Yates 
gone out, no Candle, or Supper, I ordered the 
servant to do me an Errand, the impertinent Miss 
Peggy (in attempting to imitate her mother in 
impoliteness & ill usage to me) forbid him & ordered 

<p> ]107] him back I soon let her know that tho' I received & bore innumerable Insults from that family, that I should brook none from her & I added a few strong epithets & soon gained my point & let them know with a good deal of resolution that in such a matter I should be obeyed. I had Supper immediately & Had an examination of the pupils of our Academy The Dom, Mayor & a number of other 
Gentlemen attended, examined all day & I believe acquitted ourselves with honour & acceptance, no material Accident hap'ned. & took Tea at M' Henrys & Madam Yates much more sociable & pliable this Eve than usual & & of consequence I fair much better & I find that by a great deal of submission & some flattery with a large proportion of that obsequious behavior which I never will submit to, I may live in peace, (but not happily) she is Femina sui generis 

<p>In the forenoon heard a Sermon from D'' Clarke 
upon carnal or natural & spiritual Marriage & to 
be sure he had some very curious remarks upon 
it & he is Author of the wea mouse &c & in the 
Afternoon heard D Westerlo. spent the Evening 
very agreeably at M' L Gansevorts, in company with 
the Gen, & recorder of the same name, with their 
wives, had a good supper 

Spent the Eve at W Schuylers & rehearsal 

Changed my Lodgings; left a place where evry 
circumstance conspired to make it most detested, 
both from the unpoliteness of the family & a woman 
from whom I had received innumerable insults & 
in exchange for evry perfect opposite. & my sit- 
uation is pleasant, the family hospitable, kind & 
regular & one that display the most order & greatest 
in government of any with which I was ever 
acquainted. & The contrast is so great that it 
really affords one sensations partly pleasing, & 
partly painful, pleasing to see in so great a Degree

a terrestrial Display of the first Law of heav'n; painful to see what human Nature will become without its blessed restraint & I'm sure I never can forget that most fell disposition & accompanied 
with so much Hypocrisy & so many Lies So many Insults & so many & repeated denials of favours, that room & the furniture & Sheets & wood & 
Candles, waiters & Government of family & irreg- 
ularity of Meals & manners when at Table & s. & 
to D - h & Hatt on, & no blessing except when 
strangers present. . . 

Moved my cloaths &c & the bare position in wh*" 
I found them demonstrated the feelings of the 
family . . . 

Was employed in directing the place of the Stage 
&c. M" Caldwell the Albany Schoolmadam was 
with us. She is a sensible Lady & has a sufficient 
opinion of her good sense & abilities, & is very 
severe in the manners of Youth 

Heard Dom Westerlo & Clarke preach 
dined with M' Yates & 

Had an invitation to dance, agree'd to accept, but 
at II o Clock was obliged to write the following 
Billet 
Sim Baldwin is much obliged to M'' C Ten Broeck 

for his polite invitation to dance, & as he knew 

neither the House or Company is still obliged to 

him for the promise of a Waggon (he never sent) 

to take him from M'" Lansings where he tarried 

from 8 till lo o' Clock. . . . 
this I sent the next morning & M"" T. B - k imme- 
diately waited upon me & with such Apologies & 
excuses as I thought sufficient & 

This morning the N. river was frozen over . . . 

Have been much employed for two days past in 
preparing the apparatus of the Stage for our Aca- 
demic Exhibitions, & Lm sure 'tis laborious much 
beyond my expectations & at 1 1 o Clock was much 
alarmed by word from the Mayor that we were pro- 



<p> 109 

ceeding irregularly & in not giving the Corporation 
a formal written information & Invitation to our 
Exhibitions & we went to his house & made our 
Apologies, that inasmuch as twas a matter separate 
from & after our examination, (to which we did 
invite them & waited their pleasure) we thot it not 
proper to trouble them as a bord, but to give them 
invitations as Individuals & he told us he informed 
us merely from kindness & affection & tho' at a late 
hour he would except of the invitation now & we 
wrote one immediately; he call'd for the Cryer 
(Marshall) & sent him round with all the pomp 
of formal Ceremony. 

We had 900 Tickets printed which we distributed 
among the families of the first Character in the 
place & hoping that by these & the help of a double 
Guard, we might secure a comfortable situation for 
all who we wished to have present but to our 
surprize it all had but little effect the house was 
crowded beyond belief & our side scenes were full 
& could hardly secure the Stage & The front of 
the Judges bench was broken down by the weight 
of the people upon it & & the disagreeable scene 
attended with a great deal of noise, & unpoliteness 
to each other, the Speakers, & ourselves. 
We endeavoured to entertain them with a Tragedy, 
the MOURNING BRIDE, & for a farce the Toy 
Shop & closed with the farmers blunder & the 
Youth many of them performed exceeding well, 
& did themselves much honor, notwithstanding the 
disadvantages of a noisy bable . . . Those of 
the Audience that I have conversed with confess 
themselves much pleased with the performances & 

but that the croud was insupportable 

Slept but very little last night after my fatigue 22 
have an invitation from M^ TenBroeck to Dance 
again, I suppose to make up for former treatment 
& Fm sure tis only to show him that I accept of his 
apologies, that I promise to go 

<p> [110] Joined our family at Tea, with M" Badry an 
agreeable Lady from Philadelphia & Dress'd & set 
out for my Dance & it was held near a mile out of 
Town & we were all escorted in Waggons, our Com- 
pany consisted of lo Couple & some uneasiness 
soon took place respecting our partners, some of 
the Gentlemen insisted very strongly on dividing 
by Lottery, others upon bespeaking them them- 
selves. As I was a stranger & twas the first time 
of my being admitted into the Company I chose not 
to interfere in the Dispute, tho' M' TenBroeck had 
been so kind as to engage for me an amiable partner 
a Miss P. Hogoboom. & They at length made a 
Lottery & Drew & I had the good fortune to find 
myself honoured with Miss S Lansing & to be sure 
she was as good a partner as any in the room & 
No. I. The Dispute however had run so high & 
some other little matters attending it, made it an 
unsociable Circle I myself was much displeased 
& Fm sure had reason for it, from the impoliteness 
of some who entered the Head of our Dance com- 
posed of six, (Nancy Dissor) & danced it down 
before us, turning it into a Country Dance. & We 
had a pretty good Supper & tarried till 2 o Clock, 
escorted my partner to her Home .... 
Sat agreed to take the small pox with M"" Henry's 

^3 family; wrote a letter to the Corporation for leave 

to retire as much as was necessary from the busi- 
ness of the Academy & M'' Van Neghten visited 
me; informed me he had sent a Note to TenBroeck 
for calling him a rascal & & he was willing to settle 
it by making apologies to all the Ladies & in the 
afternoon took Tea with my partner, found her 
much more sociable than usual I suppose to make 
amends for some little misconduct the Evening 
before & found D'' Stringer upon my return, he 
gave me some directions respecting our future diet, 
& some black powders for that Eve & & a portion 

Sabbath th Physic for the next morning 

24 Took my physic did not go to meeting tho it had 

<p> [111] but little effect & Lady Caldwell dined, took Tea 
& supt with us & her greatest fault is too great a 
manifestation of her own superiority & she is 
certainly sensible but too censorious. & We spent 
the Evening very sociably, gave each other many 
high Compliments, the subjects of Conversation 
were religion & phylosophy mostly . 

From the Mercury wh^ I have taken & some that 
I put upon my head I find the pours so opned that 
inadvertantly I have taken a cold & but the Doctor 
has not been here to visit me this Day & hope to be 
inoculated on the morrow 

I am not to be inoculated till Thirsday; took 
some more of the Mercurial powder & in the morn- 
ing my Physic. & attended School however. At 
noon D"" Cochran visited me & very prettily intro- 
duced himself with, ''I am D"" Cochran" as there 
was no one present to do it & after diner rode 3 
or 4 miles, come home to Tea, where were M' 
Taylor & wife a sensible Man but I could converse 
but little ; have for several Days felt myself under 
new embarassments & my animal Spirits quite 
exhausted, my Memory almost gone & what little 
I know of the Sciences seems a perfectly confused 
& indigested Mass & so almost useless. Upon my 
word I think upon it with serious concern & fear 
if I cannot find something to divert my attention I 
shall soon fall into a moping melancholy or become 
perfectly crazed. I impute the cause of it to the 
great confinement of my situation added to the 
usage of an inhuman family in wh^ I lately lived & 
& the fatiguing cares of bringing on a Quarter 
which admitted of no respit or recreation & & I 
may still add the want of surrounding intimates 
(whom I have heretofore enjoyed,) with whom I 
might spend the social hour in pleasing conversa- 
tion, might throw off the heavy cares, unbend the 
Soul, & reanimate the drooping spirits grown dull 
by fatiguing Study & Business. . . 

A great change of the weather from what it was

<p> [112] yesterday, being pleasant but very cold. & have 
just had the operation of Inocuhtion performed 
upon me by D'' Stringer ; he performs it with a great 
deal of ease ; first wets his Lancet with a very little 
of the Infection, then gently raises the Skin upon 
the Arm just so as to perceive the Blood ; the little 
orafice is then rub'd together & the opperation 
ended . . . This is also the Day appointed by 
Congress to be observed as a day of Thanksgiving. 
& to be sure tis a duty each Individual owes to the 
author & giver of Mercies, who is certainly ever 
liberal much beyond our deserts or reasonable 
expectations, & / certainly have reason, perticularly 
at this Time, for Thanksgiving, as well as a Day of 
fasting & prayer of Thanks that the giver of Life 
& preserver of Health has been pleased to moderate 
in this way the severities of the most terrible dis- 
order to which human Nature is subject; that he 
has been pleased to communicate it to man & that 
I at this time may, thro' his blessing hope to receive 
its salutory assistance ; ... of fasting & prayer, 
to the supreme physician, for his kindly presence 
& aid to moderate the severities of the Decease, for 
it certainly is severe even to those who have it but 
lightly & & to impress my Mind with an entire 
dependence upon him, that I may know where, & 
to whom I am to pay my thankful Acknowledg- 
ments, if it please that mighty Being to hand me 
safely through it . . . 

It gives me but little pain that my health would 
not permit me to enjoy the usual externals of a 
Thanksgiving Day. & since the Customs are so 
very different from those to wh^ I have been 
accostomed in N England, Tis true it in some 
measure puts a stop to their business & on that 
account seems a Damp to their Spirits, to be sure 
none of that lively Joy wh^ is there so conspicuous 
& seems to animate the Countenance of all we meet, 
is visible here. They have no extraordinary Din- 


<p> [113] ner, nor in their cookery do they at all deviate from the usual custom of each Day, & I could wish that I had reason to think that what is wanting in external show, was replaced in the superior Devotion & sincerity of their service, for they have two meetings in the Day, in the afternoon a Charity Sermon. & 

<p>Very cold; the river closed & bids fair for the Fryday 
setting in of Winter & am very well in Health & ^ 
I think more lively from my low diet than before I 
began 

This morning took 4 pills I suppose mercurial & Sat, 
was never better in health & have not for a week th^ 
back tasted Meat & but am sure from the extraor- 1782 
dinary kindness of our family I have scarce reason 
to complain of my Diet & in the morning I break- 
fast upon Coffee with Buiskit or a dry Toast of the 
best Bread that ever I ate & to relish it have cooked 
Apples my Dinner is commonly chickenbroath with 
toasted Bread, & finished with a bit of Apple pie. & 
with Tea I have butterd Buisket & apples, & I sup 
as I breakfasted unless favoured with a dish of very 
good Suppaun & in short I have more reason to 
fear I live too well for the Disease than to make the 
usual complaints & 

In the course of the week have dream't of D' 
Wood & family & of my distant Dulcinea & Have 
refused a part wh^ I was importuned to take in a 
Tragedy with M"" Lovett & some Officers in the 
place. & It was a good excuse that I was under 
Innoc"" tho' I had more weighty reasons & in the 
first place we were in an unkind, unsociable, & 
unhospitable place & & all strangers from this; 
they might think us assuming & in the next place 
the people are many of them good Judges of 
Theatrical performances, which they have fre- 
quently seen in New York & heretofore in this 
place. & while were all of us entirely ignorant & 
unexperienced in this kind of speaking & & wanted 


<p> [114] scenery & room, & might therefore reasonably expect in so large a field of wants, there would be 
room enough for the Malevolence & critical Obser- 
vations of the maliciously disposed . . Add to 
this the expence of Time & money with the difficulty 
of procuring a suitable Dress, & I think it dear 
bought fame, even if success & applause should 
crown their Labours & but if not, that if, con- 
cludes a Hiss ! & tho IVe reason to hope better of 
them, rd not run the risque. & These disadvan- 
tageous circumstances & the danger of displeasing 
the parents of our School by encroaching upon 
school Hours & drawing off the Attention from the 
business of it, make it a pleasing reflection to me 
that Tm free from it & & from the Affection I bear 

M" Lovett I wish him as much so 

Sab. Intended to go to meeting, but was prevented by 

I a potion of physic which I was obliged to take this 

morning, & to be sure it was powerful enogh to 
keep me in full employ. & Mâ¢ Caldwell & a Sister 
of M^ Hendrie dined with us, & I upon my broath 
Monday Visited M"" Yates for the second time since I left 

Dec 2th his Table & He gave me many hypocritical pro- 
fessions of friendship, & began immediately with 
"had not I better begin directly upon the study of 
the practice of Kings bench & that the Rule of 
Court was that none be admitted to the practice 
without an apprenticeship of three years & with 
a proviso however in favour of those whose Studies 
had been interrupted by the Course of the War . . 
then added, there were such & such Young Gentle- 
men pursuing the Study of Law with expectations 
of having the rule of court set aside once more to 
favour them & if that should happen he said I 
might depend on his friendship & Assistance to for- 
ward the like pretensions in me. I sincerely 
thanked him for his kindness (so formally ex- 
pressed) & made my situation, Smalpox, an apology 
for not immediately entering upon the Study with 

<p> [115] double Vigor. & I was acquainted with his ready promises & knew the disposition of the Bar which would all oppose & & the example of M'' Gilbert was fresh in my memory & In short instead of Law, I asked for the loan of Sterns Tristram Shandy . 

<p>Took Tea at Col. Cochrans after a short Viz at M" Vernon's . . . 

<p>Took pills in the morning . . 3 

<p>Am as yet perfectly well except the natural con- 4 sequences of a potion of powdered Jallap, which keeps me very busy . . in the Evening made a Visit at M" Lansings . . . 

<p>Eight Days complete since my Inoculation & I Fryday 
am perfectly Well & upon going to Bed found my 
Arm a little stiff & it soon grew sore underside 
near my body & before morning I found myself 
wakened by a pain in my Head & & neck but not 
violent . . 
Am better after geting up & taking the Air & took 7 

another portion of Jallap Had a 

most restless, painful, Night, such pains in my 
boans, back, & Head, to be sure I never before 
experienced . 

a little better this morning but no appetite felt 8 
inactive & dull & soon fell upon my Bed & when 
the D'' came in, he insisted on my getting up & 
walking, I walked with him accordingly for near 
a mile, tho' I was so weak I could hardly go, & there 
was a Damp, heavy snowstorm, yet it had the 
desired effect I came home much better than I 
went out, & tho' the weather proved very cold in 
the afternoon I repeated the experiment, & doubt 
not, but if I had got from bed & taken the Air the 
last night would have saved me many painful 
hours & my pain diminishes but I have but little 
appetite. & A melancholy accident hapned this 
day from a sudden gust of wind, which took the 
roof from off a barn, which fell upon 4 children, 

<p> [116] wounded the head of one, broke the arm of another, broke the Leg of a third, & put out the hip & wounded the Head of the other. 

Monday Spent the last night with more ease & slept con- 

J7^ siderable . . M"" Lovett slept with me, he came 

in early in the Eve with Maj Sill. & The Dom. 
Westerlo did me the honour to pay me a Visit to 
day & Alderman Hun in the Afternoon & very 
kindly desired me to send to his house if I wanted 
Fouls or fresh meat or any thing of that kind which 
he had & it should be at my service & M" Mayor 
TenBrock sent her Compliment with an offer of 
sweetmeats or anything of that nature which should 
be palateable & make my sickness more toUerable & 
am pretty well to day when in the Air & have a 
few pocks which made their appearance in the 
night 

Tuesd. In the morning a few more pocks, some few 
th eruptions in my face felt almost (free) from pain,

gratulations of all who knew me & Alderman 
Rens'laer asked me to his house, I went, his 3 
children full & just turning. . after dinner took

<p>Spent the forenoon in School, in the afternoon 
waited on D"" Bartholomew & played several 
games of chequers & he slept with me & tho I had 
a very disagreeable night, my pox about turning 
gave me the Nap effectually & to be sure in the 
middle of the night I slept but little, till I got up & 
shook them off & the pox on my tongue & in my 
throat are indeed very sore 

Am still unwell beside my sore throat & feel 
low in spirits tho this Day is the 21 Aniversary of 
my birth. & I began a letter of Thanks, which I 
thought suitable to the occasion, to my Parents for 
their Kindness & parental Affection which they ever 
manifest towards me & was not able to finish it 
on account of my health I have 7 pox on my 
Tongue & many in my Throat which then amazing 
sore & my head withal so very disordered that I 
could not lie; was obliged to get up & send to the 
D"" for an Anodyne, it had its desired effect. 

Grow better: the pox begin to dry & my throat 
almost well . .

This day I returned to the business of my school, 
evry thing returned to the former channel . . 

M"" Phelps, a young Gentleman from the East-

Load which must attend any one who has not had 
the Small pox, when in such a place as this & can 
therefore at this time with propriety & devout sin- 
cerity return my many thanks, to the mighty God 
who made me & to the merciful God who has so 
long preserved me & shown such indulgent favours, 
to the great Phisician wh. has 

at this time in particular assisted me, & to the most 
Gracious God who allows degenerate mortals to 
express that gratitude which is so justly his due & 

Dismissed the Academy till the Day after new 
Year, agreeable to the custom of Holy-days in this 
place & with this proviso that if any wished to 
attend, we would open School on Monday & Tues- 
day & Spent the Evening at M"" Gillilans with 
Mess" Lovett & Phelps . . . 

Christmas, M'' Lovett by invitation dined with 
us & spent the afternoon & evening in playing Cards 
&c. &. to be sure we had a pretty merry Christmas & 

I dined at M"" Lansings & spent much of the Day 
with M'' Lovett talking about our Dulcineas. 

It snow'd for the first time this Season & bv the 
next morn about 6 Inches deep. The circumstances 
of Albany are such that no place is more affected 
with the want of snow. They depend entirely upon 
this for their wood, Grain, Trade, & almost evry 
convenience of Life & much of its pleasures. The 
people had long wished for it. & & to be sure the 
Joy was manifest upon evry Countenance, upon its 
falling, & the frozen paths seemd warm'd with Life 
& action. & 

Had much merriment in making the Compli- 
ments of the Season, received a Cuckey according 
to the Custom of the place . . from M" Henry. 
Took Tea at M"" Scuylers & 3 European Holland- 
ers were present & spent the Eve at M' Vadnor's 
& D"" Young was present & played Chess & came 
home & wrote Letters to N Haven 

Attended the Academy according to appointment 



<p>119 

had but one student present, & in the Afternoon 
none & 

Was surprised to find Tenbroeck & V Renselear^^ Fryday 
pay me a visit from new Haven & I had but just 
sent them a packect. They brought me but one 
Letter & from Crocker/^ M"' Vadnor paid us a 
visit in the Eve. The two M' Henrys & myself sat 
down for a sociable game of whist & Young M'' 
Henry & myself were partners & we had beat 
them 2 rubbers which was a little disagreeable to 
the old Gentleman (who is an excellent Gamester 
at Whist) & were like to win the last game of the 
third & when M'' Vadnor, thro mistake dropt a 5, 
& lost the trick when he had the Queen & Jack which 
would have saved it. The old Gentleman, who has 
a temper unhappily quick & threw his cards across 
the table in a violent passion & left the room & We 
were not so much surprized, because we had fre- 
quently seen it, tho' hardly to so great a degree. 
& I never saw him play an evening without mani- 
festing some of it & I myself had him once for a 
partner & thought he used me rather roughly. & 
He soon returned again & had some reflections 
upon the bad play & when M'' Bob. Henry unhap- 
ily made this true observation that he manifested 
so much temper that nobody chose to play zvith 
him. & the truth is not always to be spoken & it 
spur'd the old Gent.''" Hobby-Horse. when that is 
effectively pricked, tis very apt to run away with 

the rider M'' Henry to be sure called 

Bobby much to nought, & accused him of irrever- 
ence & disrespectful treatment & ingratitude, which 
he had long born but would no more & Bobby 
replyd he knew he had been obliged, but ever dis- 
charged his obligations with Gratitude & M" 
Henry came in much distressed, we all tried what

<p> [120]  was in our power to pacify them but to no avail & they carried matters on both sides to great ex- 
tremes & even agreed to separate & that M"" Bob 
should seek his lodgings somewhere else . . but 
upon the whole I must think the old Gentleman 
much the most to blame he certainly led the way 
to all the excess . . we at last with much per- 
swasion got them to supper & I shifted the con- 
versation as soon as I could find opportunity. 
Albany After Breakfast M"" Henry asked me to take a 

T^^*%>, ride in the Sleisfh we went to the flatts & to 
1783 Major & Col. Schylers. & had a pretty clever ride & 

Young M'' Henry is very busy in adjusting his 
accounts & is determined upon new Lodgings . . . 
I said much to prevent it, & hope they may be recon- 
ciled, tho' he & his uncle have not exchanged a word 
to Dav . . . 
M. 6. The M'' Henrys settled the unhappy difference. & 

Wednesday Very cold, The Patroon took M'' Lovett & my- 
jan.8 gg|Â£ jj^^Q Sleigh to M'' John's VR-ss-r to converse 

upon the subject of our Society of B K ; agreed 
to hold meetings here & desired me to write for a 
Charter & Laws & w^ I did that night, 
lo&ii There fell a Snow of near 18 Inches. & Was 

introduced to 2 young Gentlemen by the name of 
Payne from Worcester, who appeared to be most 
accomplished & agreeable Persons & the one a 
Druggist They took Tea & supt with us, together 
with M' Williams an Atf from Pitsfield.

formed a party for a ride on pleasure to Schenec- Wednesday 
tada & sat out about 2 o Clock & & arrived at 
Sch. about dusk after a very cold ride & spent 
part of the Evening in the singing-school & had 
an elegant supper at Lewis Tavern with some Com- 
pany of the place & next morning Walked round ^^ 
the Town before Breakfast found the situation, 
being upon a large plain, to be very agreeable & the 
Town large, equal to any in Connecticut & & very 
regular in the streets & Breakfasted & got into our 
Sleigh about no Clock & I had the good pleasure 
to meet M'" Lockwood very unexpectedly at this 
Tavern & he set out soon after us for Albany & 
we came to Albany about i. & the funeral of Gen- 
eral Lord Stirling^* was attended with much pomp 
at 4 . . M' Lockwood took Tea with me & spent 
the Eve with Major Sill & Jackson & wrote a 
letter to Miss Wood . . 

Fryday M'' Mosely returned & I was a little sur- 17 
prized that he never called to let me know it. & 

M'" Henry invited me to go into the country with ^^^ 
him & M"" Vadnor for a ride & as twas Saturday I 
agreed to accept it & we sat out about 10 o Clock, 
the day very pleasant . . went thro' the new 
City, a very pleasant pretty little country place, on a 
plain large enough for a large City & arrived at M" 
People's at Half moon at dinner time, our next 
stage was at M'' Schyler's at Stillwater ; was intro- 
duced to his daughter Else a pretty sensible, but not 
handsome Miss & we made but little stay & stopt 
a little at M"" Varnor's farm (beautifully situated 
on the river) on our way to Ensigns, where we 
lodged; spent the Evening very agreeably & had 
plenty of good punch & slept with an Arche Mc- 
Neal. ( You must lie the hack side, Neighbour. )

the earldom of Sterling. He was a Major General in the Continental 
army.

19 The next morning before Breakfast we rode to 
Saratoga & passed Gen Schylers seat which is 
certainly very grand & he has an interval of 6 or 
700 acres all in a piece upon the Banks of the Hud- 
son, & upon a Creek that runs thro them several 
very stately mills for grinding & sawing, the sit- 
uation & prospect good . . we passed the fort 
& Barrack which are a little beyond & Breakfasted 
at Mahoney's . . came back to Ensigns to 

. Dinner. & after the satisfaction of viewing the 
place & ground where Burgoyne & his army sur- 
rendered, we had passed the place of battle the 
day before & the works were still visible extending 
for near a Mile back from the river into the woods, 
upon Bemus Heights & Burgoyne's entrench- 
ments were nearly as extensive, at about a miles 
distance. & We took Tea in the afternoon with 
Miss Schyler & lodged at M" Peebles ; had a merry 
Evening with the Ladies & the drift of all the 
jokes was centered upon M'" Henry & Miss Rosy & 

20 Till we almost offended them. We brokef ast there 

& took Toddy, for want of punch, at Mollenbeek's 
& reached home about 10 Clock . 

27 received Letters & some shirts from home by M' 

Lord. & Took Tea with M'' John VR - r. over the 
river & & the next Saturday he waited on me with 
a Sleigh to M' S Dow's. & 
Monday & Spent the Eve at M' Judge Yates, Peter Do. & 
Gen Ten Brock there I had the Honor to see & be 
introduced to Miss Peggy Schyler & I might have 
mentioned her mother first & waited on them 
across the Street to M'' Taylors without mine Hatt. 

& supt with young Ten Broeck & his good mother ; 
he made me a present of Doolittle new Col. of 
psalm Tunes

hoven's at Half Moon : twas a beautiful ride most 
of the way on the Ice & we were treated with the 
greatest Complisance & hospotality & spent the 
Eve at Phil Renss'rs & Gillalands . 

So exceeding cold did not go to meeting & spent 
part of the Eve at M'' Gillilands & 

M" Lovett & I went for a Viz, to M' Shaws & 
as M"" Graham & his Lady were absent we spent the 
Eve till near 120 Clock at M'' Gillilands : had a little 
family Dance. & 

& took punch at noon with M' M^'Clellen & by his 
invitation spent the Eve & supt with him & had a 
merry Game of whist & he & I opposed M' Henry 
& Lovett, & we won a rubber & 

Took Tea at Jacob Cuyler & & entered a com- 
plaint about his Son John & received his confession 
& promise & of amendment. 

took Tea at Peter Yates & supt with Alderman 
Hun. & 

Examination in the Academy. Supt again with 
the same company as on thursday with M' 
M^ Clellen & 

Dined with a pretty large Circle at M' James 
Varnors & He is a well built, handsome Bache- 
lor of 32 & is naturally sensible read considerable, 
travelled more, & frequented a great deal of Com- 
pany & that very good & was once much of a 
buck & but is reformed, & has a pretty estate & 
is exceeding hospitable & & upon the whole is a 
man of Pleasure & & independent Sentiment. & 

I was so unhappy as to wound the feelings of a 
Baptist, M'' Barry who was in the Circle by intro- 
ducing the observations made by Stern upon their 
anteborn Baptisms & slops Oath, &c . . I soon 
perceived the mistake & endeavoured to take off the 
edge by observing upon the too great freedom & 
severity of the author & for tis ever against my 
principle to ridicule any one of whatever perswai- 
sion when sincerity & a consciousness of rectitude

of Conduct are evident & for under that rule I 
have charity for all. & spent the Eve too v^ith 
M' Varnor & attempted to sup but had the mortifi- 
cation to be so sick by smoaking as to have no 
appetite. . . 

Frydayii Spent the Eve at Col. Cochrans, had two or 3 
games of whist &c & came home early. & 

Wed. Visited M'' Graham found the little pair at home, 

'^ thought they cared but little about our company & 

& I am sure 'twas mutual 

13 Made a little visit in the Eve at Sheriff T.Broecks 

Maggy was Ironing & not a little mortified & I 
went from there to P. Yates & supt ; found the old 
Lady much more sociable than usual & a little 
reformed from brutallity & but still the rough 
manners of the children would disgrace a family of 
far less pretentions than theirs. & I might have 
observed too that I took Tea at M'' Bloodgoods with 
a large Circle & among the rest was a Miss Caty 
Dyckman & a great Bell & much for Dress & & 
a little affected & was formerly from New York & 
had Travelled a good deal & read considerable & I 
had not the pleasure to be introduced to her & but 
she evidently manifested a desire to form my 
acquaintance & gave me a fair opportunity & to 
offer my Arm & escort her home more than half a 
mile & I am almost ashamed to say it that my 
embarassment in having two or three married 
Ladies to accompany another way (which however 
on such an occasion might have been dispensed 
with) & & my want of acquaintance with the world, 
mankind & Company, prevented me from making 
the suitable apologies on either side & so I left Miss 
Caty, (not however without several gentlemen in 
the House that might accompany her) & waited on 
M" Henry & M" Barry & & then reflected. . . 

Fryday M' Lovett & myself sat out for a visit at 

Cloverack & Cocksocea & left Albany about noon 
dined with Capt Woodworths & had his sleigh & 



14 

<p> [125] servant & after an agreeable ride on good Slighing we passed thro' Kenderhook to our destined port that Evening & took lodgings at Hogebooms & he has three very amiable Daughters & we were soon admitted into their room by the old Lady & after first calling them out and passing the ''How do you does" we soon fell into a round of very agreeable Chitchat, & had cards at pleasure & all conspired to make our Time happy & visit agreeable & supt at 9 & sat up till ^2 past 10 & We tarried in the place all day & visited & dined with M' Gilbert & afternoon took the Ladies into 
the sleigh & visited at a M"" Tenbroacks there were 
two young old Ladies, returned about dusk took 
a short Eveningside & compleated a scene similar 
to the last nights. & formed an acquaintance with 
a M' Peter T'Broecker 

After Breakfast rode to Judge Morris's spent an 
hour or two & crossed the river to Cocksocea found 
the D"" Bartholomew & Capt Vanscoyk were gone 
to Albany & this obliged us tho' contrary to our 
expectations to proceed home, accordingly after 
dinner we set out & stopt at Col. Nicoll's; he & 
family were gone too, to Albany & so we returned 
home that evening & 

& f cell very happy that I did for tis to day very 
rainy & warm. 

Yesterday very warm & rainy, so that the river 
rises fast & was called out immediately after dinner 
(which I took with M'' Lansing & ) to see the break- 
ing up of the river, & to be sure it was a sight worth 
observing & The ice had before came down & stopt 
within about a mile & this had choked the water 
& prepared a greater force & 'twas now all in 
motion & almost one solid cake & calm, seeming to 
move with a beautiful regularity, & but twas soon 
changed & the jutt*^ Docks seemed in vain to oppose 
its passage & the large Logs of which they were 
composed were broke with as much apparent ease

as the stem of a brittle pipe & the foundations 
torn up & & in their place piles of powdered ice 
seemed to rise spontaneously, like the belching fires 
from a Vesuvius & There is a winding of the 
shoar near the Academy, which as it opposed the 
progress of the Cakes, afforded a scene of horrid 
Grandeur almost beyond Imagination & for by 
crowding the foremost cakes upon the land & fence 
which they beat down, the others, which succeeded, 
would increase the pile till they appeared to rise like 
clouds, almost perpendicular the height of 30 or 
40 feet & as they broke and fell, others would suc- 
ceed & this lasted about 10 minutes when it was 
succeeded by the broken ice which formed a prosses 
of grand Confusion & All the people of the City 
were down as spectators & and the various pas- 
sions which moved them was diverting to indifferent 
spectators & they were all atte(ntion) were all 
passion & some fearing the fate of many buildings 
(which) were exposed & & the consequence of an 
inundation. & others their own Docks & Vessels & 
stables & even Houses for several were in much 
danger ; others enjoied the rich scene without reflec- 
tion & were all eyes & & even wished it might 
increase & some you would see agitated at once 
with evry passion which would arise on such an 
occasion & 

The stable next to the Academy House was 
almost torn to pieces & a slaughter house at a dis- 
tance thrown down; several vessels were driven 
from the creeks to a considerable distance upon the 
high bancks & it was indeed a scene that would 
excite the attention of any one but had more of 
grand confusion than regular beauty. & 
Thursday The water rose the last night so as to almost fill 
^ the cellars of our house; we were obliged to move 

the cattle & even the hens from the stable & evry 
thing of consequence from the rooms below 
I went to the schoolhouse but found it surrounded 



<p> 127 

with water so that I could not get to it without a 
Canoe, considerable of our wood was gone & the 
yard full of broken Ice & The water is still high 
but the ice mostly gone. & 

The water rises & falls alternately & sometime Fryday 
in quick succession as the channel is checked more 
or less below & it was supposed to have swelled to 
the height of 13 or 14 feet which is great in this 
Town as it lies very low & the Academy-House still 
surrounded with water, but had it opened & kept 
school & 

Water subsides & have employed the leisure of Sat. 
3 or 4 Days past in reading to M" Henry the His- 
tory of Miss Emily Montague written by a Lady 
in a series of Letters & 'tis a pretty little love tail 
without much sentiment. & 

Saw accidentally several of the Albany Gallants. 
Passed a cold & indifferent How do do, joind cold 
hands with one but believe it did not shake up the 
tender emotions of drowsy friendship on either side. 
We are quite indifferent & Fm sure I feel much 
of the stoick with respect to them & their whole 
Company & & I fear rather too much for the world 
in general & I am sensible I have a awkward stiff- 
ness & an embarrassment which makes me appear 
insipid in Company & yet that nothing but a fre- 
quent practice in Company will polish it off. In my 
opinion too the manners of them in general are but 
little better. & in short I do not like them & they 
envy me my situation & & make no allowances for 
want of improvement. The consequence is that 
several invitations some of which I refused & those 
that I accepted I was not very well pleased with & 
they have neglected to invite me. I am determined 
not to play the sycophant & so frequent no Com- 
pany & the pleasure I loose I set down as nothing & 
the advantage in employing those hours in reading 
is certainly something & The only particulars in 
which it is disagreeable are i the want of those

quenting Company & 2 the wound it might give

out the Circumstances that I frequented no Com- 
pany & 
Sabath A. M. read in Drillencourt on Death & it is a

M" Yates P & & spent part of the eve at Dr 
Young's, heard some of the particulars of an un- 
happy Expedition against Oswago commanded by 
Col. Willet & their dependance was on surprize & 
They were misted & went thro' a wet swamp in the 
night & 150 of their men were frozen in feet or 
hands & & at day brake when they were to attack 
the fort & they found themselves 7 or 8 miles out 
of the way. & of consequence the expedition 
failed & 
24*^ Had the curiosity to attend a dutch funeral the 

remains of Col. V.Renslear a man & rich & old & 
universally beloved & he lived on the other side 
of the river from Town & but the whole City & 
14 or 15 miles round were invited & also all Claverac 
as they were his Tenants & the Ice was gone so 
we were obliged to ferry But yet there were many 
present & the house in evry room had as many as 
could sit with convenience, & servants at the Doors 
to direct people according to their appearance. No 
Ladies were present & The procession began 
about 3 o Clock & the Corps preceeded upon a 
Coach converted into a Hearse by taking off the 
Box &c & the Horses were white, but covered with 
black cloth & & the Coachman all in black & next 
followed 10 persons with scarfs of white & the 
mourners without scarfs & & then the ministers & 
Doctors with & after these the people who attended 
walked in a long train by pairs & all were invited 
to return to the house & take a glass of wine & 



<p> 129 

Tables were sett in evry room of a very large house 

& with Bottles of wine, glasses & pipes & Tobacco 
with candles ready lighted & servants with each a 
white Napkin round their arm stood ready to replace 
any thing that was wanted. & the wine was pretty 
good & Im sure many drank of it very freely : their 
merriment was apparent & In a word the whole 
scene had rather the appearance of a jovial meeting, 
than the tender, sympathetic feelings of a humane 
Condolence & there was no prayer & & the con- 
versation was upon News & horsejockeying & & 
other indifferent subjects & Im sure I did not hear 
a word, adapted to the occasion or a house of 
mourning & in reallity the appearance is rather of 
joy & feasting & I staid near an hour, & left 
many behind & crossed in a boat with one as beastly 
drunk, as was possible in so short a time & I saw 
an other nearly as bad, & I doubt not, there were 
several in the same situation as many of the lower 
kind go purposely with that design . 

I spent the Eve & supt at M" Judge Yates, had 
a very merry time. D" Young & M"" Lovett were 
present. 

Feb 20 & 1783 & 

Read Baker on Learning & which is in short a 
confused mass seeking for the faults of evry kind 
of Science without an attempt to remedy them & it 
appeared to me the Gentleman wrote it purely from 
the vanity of wishing to be called an author. 

In the leasure hours of 2 or 3 Days, have been 
reading the History of Miss Emily Montague writ- 
ten by a Lady in a course of Letters from the Actors 

& The scene opens in Canada where Emily happens 
to be with an Aunt M" Melmoth. thro' the media- 
tion of this Aunt & her husband & Emily is courted 
by one Sir George Clayton, afterwards a barrpnet, 
a great fortune & she agrees to marry him but 
before the happy day & she is blessed with the sight 
of Ed. Rivers & they are mutually pleased & they

among my chagrins or not & were it in some other 
places it certainly would & or even here if the com- 
pany were such as I wished or liked & It is appar- 
ently a designed neglect & but believe my Philoso- 
phy will easily support it, from such Characters. & 

They had their Ball & I to be sure had no Card

& had a Bill of 30s. The neglect is all that troubles 
me 

took Tea with Mâ¢ Judge Yates & she invited me 
to sup next night, which I did on a fine Turkey 
with a clever Company & jolly evening . 

Heard Dom. Westerlo in A M upon the Thorns 
& Briars in the Vineyard & (i. e.) siners in the 
Church & P M Dined at Home with a Capt Jones 
from near Boston, heard M'' Proudfoot preach an 
insipid Sermon & 

Had an invitation to dance, but mustered spirit 
enough to refuse & for the party was made up of 
those by whom I was neglected before & & Im 
determined never to show to them any of that fawn- 
ing behavior wh^ I am persuaded would introduce 
me into Company & & as tis disagreeable to visit 
Ladies at one time & cant at another & I seldom 
trouble them; am therefore almost constantly at 
Home & doubt not but 'twill be nearly as much to 
my advantage & pleasure & 

Took Tea at M" J. Yates & walked round the 
great square without entering any House. 

Was both parts of the Day to hear a New Eng- 
land preacher & was not very fond of him & went 
to take Tea at D'' Youngs. Miss Enice was at 
M' DToisters, went there with the D" & took Tea 
& made a little visit & returned to his House to the 
agreeable entertainment of a Philosophic Conver- 
sation. 

The D'" is a man of very humly visage, of rather 
mean appearance & but very affable & long accus- 
tomed to study, & close reasoning & is endowed with 
as excellent faculties for it as any man of my 
acquaintance & takes nothing for granted because 
evry one says tis so & in short he dives to the 
bottom of evry thing & has reasoned himself into 
the confirmation of deisticle tenets & He extends 
his researches to the field of Nature & the physical

Causes of her Productions & he showed me sev- 
eral disquisitions of his upon several philosophic 
points & Electricity is his Hobby Horse; he 
applies it to evry thing & makes it the operating 
Cause of Life, Vegitation, Heat, attraction & its 
contrary; & in short evry motion, even the animal 
Spirits, are influence by it. & 

This indeed is the Data upon which he tells me 
he has founded the science of his Profession & He 
is new in almost evry thing ; has wrote considerable 

& & I think it appears very reasonable & He 
laments that he has not time to digest his Ideas, to 
form them into a system & & to make the necessary 
experiments & I must think if he had, his new 
system would appear much to his advantage & 

All kind of Attraction even Magnetism is the 
effect of repulsion & there is but one kind of heat 
or fire in Nature & that is Electric in motion more 
or less rapid. & All bodies even Electricity when 
destitute of Motion are by nature cold & & they 
naturally condense when this fluid becomes dormant. 

& & the promotion of this dormant situation of 
Elec. is the opperation of Cold in the production 
of Ice. &

Tuesd. 


Went to M"" Grahams chamber & took a glass of 
bitters at noon, agreeable to invitation & there 
were several young Gentlemen in, upon the busi- 
ness of forming a dance as I supposed & my invi- 
tation there I knew to be in consequence of my 
asking the like favour of him, as he passed my 
chamber the day before & & the consequence of 
both was, that I received a Card the next morning, 
inviting me to attend a Ball on Thursday & Vini 



<p> 133 

sacra fames, quid non mortalia pectora f acere cogis 

& Per hoc, mihi manifesti apparent, omnia quae 
necessaria sunt, ut conciones eorum frequentarem 

& I was some time in suspence whether, after 
several neglects & I should accept or refuse the 
invitation & my friends advised me to go & their 
Balls are conducted by managers, who invite who 
they please in general & once or twice I was 
unacquainted with the Managers & another I knew 
had a spite against me & & on these accounts could 
not be a designed neglect & These expressed a 
strong desire to have me there & said it would be 
agreeable to the Company & these added to a 
desire to see the ceremonies & manners of the Com- 
pany induced me to accept it & I went & found 

the circle smaller than I expected, but agreeable & Thurs. 
in general the Gentlemen had provided partners for ^^ 
the Eve as is usual & there were several however 
that had not & I among the rest & so I was intro- 
duced to a Miss Nancy DePoister & obtained her 
for my partner & seniorissima, et visu inurban- 
issima omnium puellarum, vel feminarum ejusce 
splendidae frequentiae, tamen^^ an agreeable per- 
son & a lively dancer & one whose experience had 
made some progress in the road towards perfection 

& she danced well & I made but few mistakes. 
There was a sleigh provided for the use of the Com- 
pany, each took this and went for his partner ; they 
were introduced with little Ceremony, except by 
the Managers to those Gentlemen who were not 
acquainted with them & no dancing till they all 
came in & a Lottery was then made & the Ladies 
drew for their number in the Dance & the Ball 
was opned with a Minuet & a Country-Dance imme- 
diately called they succeeded each other till sup-

Cotelons were then danced, with one or two reels 
& the whole closed with a sett of Country dances & 
Broke up about 3 o Clock & each retired with his 
Partner & next day took Tea with mine, found 
her much pleased, & very sociable, spent the Eve 
with her at D'' Youngs. & 

Yesterday attended the funeral of a M' Van- 
Teoyck. drank no wine ; but took Tea in its room 
at P W Yates, after spending the afternoon in 
attempting to scan the character of a Capt Jones, 
& I think him an ignorant, self conceited, unprin- 
cipled man, & one that is neither an agreeable or 
useful acquaintance. & Dined this day at Peter 
Yates, 'tis S^ Patricks which is celebrated by a 
number of Drunken soldiers & low people, an 
unhappy reflection that yÂ® effects of a religious 
inthusiasm should be the cause of such scenes of 
Debauchery & excess in wickedness. & Spent the 
Eve with good old Alderman Hun upon evry topic 
of Conversation that I can think of, a great deal 
of plain good nature & affection is manifest. & 

Heard the glorious news of a general Peace 
among the belligerent powers of Europe & America 
& twas brought by express into Albany. the 
People, by the Cryer were desired to meet at the 
City Hall immediately & the Letters were read 8z 
3 Cheers universally given & other demonstrations 
of Joy were suspended till official accounts whould 
come to Pland & No place on the Continent, which 
is so far from the enemy, is so immediately affected 
as this & shut out from any seaport & trade, their 
dependance, entirely stagnated, & the most affluent 
families reduced to poverty. & It does one good 
to see the general Joy, which sparkles in the Eyes & 
enlivens the Countenance & animates the feelings 
of all & especially the unhappy who could say, nos 
patriam fugimus. Took Tea yesterday at Corn"' 
Cuylers & & spent part of the Eve at M"" De- 
poisters. & 

<p> [135] Was over at Greenbush to see several horse races. Sat spent the Eve with a large & agreeable Circle at ^^ 
T. V. Grahams Esq. play'd whist & drank mull'd 
cyder & next day took Tea at Gillilands, Esq . . . 

Was invited to spend the Eve with a sociable Monday 
Circle, to celebrate the Peace & Independence of ^^''chai 
America & we met at Kinears, was agreeably 
entertained 'till after Supper & when we were 
called to sit round the Table & drink. A President 
was immediately proposed & M'' A. Lansing seated 
in the Chair. he required absolute powers. I 
opposed it & had two to second me & for I knew the 
consequence of such authority & I was determined 
not to disgrace myself by Liquor which I had so 
often disapproved in others & the Vote went 
against me, & the event soon proved my fears to be 
true, if any refused to drink what he was ordered, 
a funnel was introduced & some of the Company 
ordered to oblige him to it, nor might any leave 
the room without Leave & I was careful not to 
offend against order, so that some were merry 
before I had drank much & I was determined to 
drink as much as I could well bear without opposi- 
tion; then to place my foot immovable. & I had 
drank several Beakers and was determined to 
oppose the next, but was prevented by one before 
me who was ordered to drink 2 large beakers of 
Grog after the Egg Punch we had been drinking 
he took one & refused the other, the President 
ordered compulsory measures, the Company was 
divided & the setting ended in a happy Tumult. & 
several Ciceronian harangues were made, by the 
lively spirit of what we had drank, I was with 
the minor party in opposition & I plead that the 
design of a sociable meeting was the happiness of 
the Circle, which could not be increased by such 
scenes of debauchery & & the occasion of this meet- 
ing was to celebrate the freedom & Independence 
of the United States & that there was therefore an 

<p> [136] inconsistency in introducing the idea of absolute 
Power & & much to that effect. & I came home 
without being tipsy & fell in company with Miss 
Gitty Lansing & saw her home oscula junximus 
& I came home. 
Wednesday Was visited by C. Ten Broeck & A. Van Vechten 
April 2 ^^^ ^j.g^ J (.^j-g^ not much about & & the other I 

did not want to see & for at a ball made in the 
winter in which he was manager & & after express- 
ing a particular affection for me & he invited one 
from the house & sent no Card to me & I cared 
but little about going & but the respect due to our 
apparent friendship, demanded it & this he had 
violated, & this ought in itself to have satisfaction 
& in its own way & therefore I did not wish to 
manifest those professions of esteem which I would 
to another & Nothing was said upon the subject 
& but he manifested a desire to please & being at 
my own Chamber twas difficult to treat him quite 
as he deserved . . therefore sent for Cards & 
had a game of Whist with them & M"" Henry. 
April Took Tea with Dr Stringer & heard of the 

Monday Paper War in Con. respecting Y College & the next 
day procured some of the Papers which contained 
them, found they were written with much plain- 
ness & & a good deal of Elegance & spent part 
of the Eve too with M"" Lansing. & 

8 As I was sitting in my School, perceived one of 
the Buttons on a Boys Coat that had polished 
bright upon plains unparallel sent forth rays that 
were very perceptible 

Quaery & how could they be seen if Light does 
not reflect Light Spent the Eve with a sociable 
Circle at M"" Grahams . . 

9 Was moved with the affecting sight of 5 or 6 
in a Company & of the unfortunate sufferers of 
Col. Willets expedition against Oswago & their 
feet bound up & some with the loss of half their 
foot hobblig about to take air

Betsy Sanders for a partner, against John VRanse- 
laer & Miss Glen from Schenectady was not used 
very handsomely by the Company who went oif & 
left me with the old People & 

Was invited to attend a Ball: excused myself 
from attending & Was at meeting in the fore- 
noon, took Tea at home & walked over the Hill 

to Mills stop'd at Bloodgood's stoop, again

tion, so as to warrant our manifestations of Joy 
upon this aniversary as we wished & expected. 
The express however brought the desired accounts 
Sab. this morning; tis to be read to morrow & the 

^ demonstrations of Joy the day following & the 

Domine preached a very good Sermon adapted both 
to y^ occasion & that of Easter, from XIII of 
Hebrews 20 & 21 & 
2ist The first thing observed this day was the method 

of exhibiting the mirth of this holiday which is the 
next succeeding Easter or in dutch called Pause & 
it is this & the Saturday before evry family boils 
a basket of Eggs, colouring them in a curious 
maner & they are boiled very hard, & each of the 
family takes several & goes among his intimates, 
challenging them to butts; the Eggs are struck 
together & the one that is brok is given to the one 
who breaks it. & there is much merriment in it & 
but mostly practised among children. 

At 9 o Clock the Citizens were called to the City- 
Hall to hear the Proclamation of the Gov concern- 
ing a Peace & cessation of Hostilities & & a vast 
concourse crowded together & gave three general 
chears & proceeded to the church & where we had 
a very good Sermon for the occasion by Dom. Wes- 
terlo from Psalms LXVI, 8 to 14 
Albany Met with the Citizens about 10 o Clock at the 

ia^nS^^ City Hall & had a long Procession from that to 
the Mill & preceeded by the Common Council & 
Cannon & Bells constantly contributing their aid to 
enliven the Passions & a long Table was provided, 
the Liquor ready & 13 Toast given with a Huzza 
& 13 Cannon to each, this took up most of the fore- 
noon & we retired to Dinner & returned in the 
afternoon & repeated our Toasts & over a Cup of 
Wine & satisfied any apetite with seeing, instead 
of eating the roasted OX. & In the beginning of 
the Evening fire was put to a large pile of pine 
wood, prepared for the purpose, round a pole with 


<p>[ 139 ] a large Barrel of Tar on the Top & it made a beautiful appearance & we had no proper fireworks of Powder & some were drunk, many were merry, & all were Happy & The City was illuminated till no Clock & appeared very beautiful & during which the streets were crowded with people of evry 
kind & sex & The Gentlemen of the City in gen- 
eral spent the night & following Day in Debauchery 
& Carouse & so that 'twas almost thought a duty 
inseparable from a true whig Patriot to make 
himself a convert, to the depravity of their Tast &: 
practice & I was strongly solicited to join in this 
peculiar method of demonstrating Joy & but found 
means to evade it. & 

Evening was at an elegant Ball made to crown 
our festivals & it consisted of about 30 couple, 4 
or 5 of wh^ did not dance, so that we stood upon the 
floor 13 in a sett were elegantly dress'd, made a 
brilliant appearance & all were Happy. & 

took Tea at M"" R. Lansings as my partner was 
out contrary to my reasonable expectations, on 
my return she was in the stoop & made many 
apologies, insisted on my taking Tea on the morrow 
I did not promise & nor did I go & 

D Westerlo gave his audience a very good dis- 
course from Luke i : 74 & 5 took the occasion to 
give a severe reprimand to those persons who had 
exceeded the bounds of a proper rejoicing after Tea 
Maj Sill came in & we went to D'' Smiths & spent 
the remainder of the Afternoon in singing of Psalm 
Tunes, according to the custom of New England & 

In the morning went to Judge X's to receive 
excuses from M" X for her Son's absence from 
School & she invited me to Tea, the Judge then 
in Court & In the Afternoon I went & the Judge 
standing at the Door, waited on me in & I imme- 
diately saw the confusion of the family & & in their 
countenances read what had passed & she pass'd 
a cold Compliment & & we sat down & she imme-

diately introduced the subject & that she was 
plagued almost to death by her unruly son & his 
father she said abused her & "abuses me, M"" Bald- 
win, beyond account" I was all confusion & 
would have given anything to have been absent & 
& had I not promised to take Tea, would have left 
the house immediately & The Judge said not a 
word but took his Hatt & retired, while she went 
on with the disagreeable tale & I used evry means 
to divert it & & at length made her sociable on other 
matters & when Tea was ready the judge returned 
& said & "well, M"" B., has my wife black-balled me 
sufficiently & " her Eyes look'd as if they'd leave 
their sockets to take revenge. I told him we waved 
the Subject as soon as possible & & by turning to 
other Subjects, prevented her reply & she had 
indulged the boy from infancy & now as he grew 
older he expected the same Liberties & & always 
found a shelter in her protection & the Judge 
determined to break him & she was an exceeding 
bad tempered woman & and tis common where the 
Passions move easily one way they also do the other 

& it gave pain to her tender feelings to have him 
whip'd & she took the childs part & & blamd the 
father & which more than spoil'd the effect of the 
correction & what unhappy consequences attend a 
disagreement, with those who are thus closely bound 
by evry endearing Tie &

some of their disagreeable Douts sprauter & they

the return of Spring opned the exhibitions, the 
Tragedy Orphan of China succeeded, this was 
followed by a humerous Dialogue written by M'

of an honourable Peace closed the amusement of 
the Evening, the one written by Judge Yates & the 
other by his honour myself & we were honoured 
by as many persons of the first families in Town

M'' Henry out of affection for me, & seeing my
