Notice. A general meeting of the citizens of Albany
and its vicinity is requested at the City Hall on Wednesday,
the 16th inst., at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, to
take into consideration the present alarming state of our
country, and to adopt such resolutions as the importance
of the subject shall require. May 11, 1798.
This meeting passed resolutions complimentary of the
administration of John Adams, and deprecatory of the
French system of spoliations which was practiced upon
American commerce. The resolutions were forwarded
to the president, who replied to them. (See vol. iii., p.
190.)

Leather, second door east of the Low Dutch Church,
State street.

Livingston, 335. In Rensselaer county 1119 to 510, by
which it appears that Rensselaer county polled only 345
votes less than Albany county. The vote in New
York was 1060 to 793. Total vote of the state, Jay,
16,012; Livingston, 13,634. Majority for Jay, 2378.
Sept. 8. Donald McDonald, lately from London, now
at No. 13 Court street, introduced " the new Brutus wig,
worn by gentlemen of the latest fashion in London."
Sept. 10. It is with the most heartfelt satisfaction,
says a writer in the Gazette, that we can inform our
brethren of the Roman Catholic faith, that their church in
this city is so near completed as to be under roof, glazed
and floored (fire proof). That it is a neat building, and
will be an ornament to the city, and a lasting blessing to all
who are members in communion of that church. To the
citizens in general of this city and its vicinity, and several
of the other cities of the United States and Canada, the
sincere prayers of the members of this church are due for
their liberality in aiding to erect it. Such of our Catholic
brethren in this neighborhood as have riot already contributed,
it is hoped will now come forward and offer their
mite to discharge the last payment of the contract, there
being but a small sum in hand for that purpose. To give
to the church, is itnot to lend to the Lord, who will
26

richly repay the liberal giver with many blessings ? Should
not all the members unitedly raise their voices in praise
to God, who has cast their lot in this good land, where
our church is equally protected with others, and where
we all so bountifully partake of his goodness ? What is
man without religion, which teaches us the love of God
and our neighbor, and to be in charity with all mankind ?
Surely without this he is nothing.
1799.

May 17. The Western Inland Lock Navigation Company
declared a dividend of 3 per cent.

in some parts of Montgomery county the most promising
crops are already totally cut off.
The Common Council resolved to prohibit all breaches
of the sabbath, under the act for suppressing immorality,

or who may expose any articles for sale on that day contrary
to the act for suppressing immorality; and that
they report the names of aggressors, on every Monday
morning, to the mayor or recorder, to be proceeded
against according to law.
The obstruction in the Hudson between Troy and Lansingburgh,
occasioned by what was called the lower reef,
was overcome by a channel 30 feet wide and 5 feet deep
at low water, so that taking advantage of the tides it
was thought vessels carrying 2000 bushels of wheat
might pass without difficulty. It was confidently expected
to render the navigation as good above Troy as
below.
In June, 1797, the Managers of the N. Y. State Road Lottery,
advertised their scheme No. 1, consisting of 6,458
prizes, amounting to $125,000, and 18,542 blanks, making
25,000 tickets, at $5 each. The prizes were subject
to a deduction of 15 per cent. The drawing was advertised
to commence at Albany immediately after the sale
of the tickets should be completed, which, considering
that the object of the lottery was one of great public
utility, and claimed the encouragement of the citizens of
the state in general, it was confidently expected would

<p>

be very speedy. But it was not till the 14th of May
1799, that the drawing commenced, and continued fortytwo
days.
The expenses for lighting the city and for a night

at each of the three services, for the relief of the distressed
citizens of New York, by reason of the yellow
fever, which produced $247.
A collection during the afternoon service in St. Peter's
church produced $107'87. Two collections in the Presbyterian
church the same day produced $201. Total $555 '87.

A law to regulate the assize of bread, passed the
Common Council, accompanied by a schedule for graduating
the price, and every baker detected in selling light
bread subjected himself to a fine of $1 for every loaf
found to be light of weight. By this schedule, when

and all intermediate prices in proportion.
It appears by advertisements annually inserted in the
papers that a fair was held annually in the fall by direction
of the Common Council. No notice was taken
of them by the papers.
The Directors of the First Company of the Great
Western Turnpike Road, advertised for proposals for
constructing the road from the Schoharie creek westward;
the road to be 28 feet wide, the arch 20 feet; "and
to be made of stone, gravel, or such other hard substance
as will secure a firm foundation and an even surface ;

and the hills to he so dug down, as to render an easy
passage for loaded carriages." Also proposals for building
a bridge across the Schoharie creek, at the place at
which the State bridge formerly stood, by the first day of
November, 1800. The notice is signed by
" Charles R.
Webster, Secretary of said company." This turnpike appears
to have been constructed upon the old State road.
The citizens of Hudson were also on the alert to have a
road to intersect this turnpike, to lead the trade from the
west to their village. They had already subscribed the
stock in a road to meet the Massachusetts and Connecticut
turnpikes, thus forming a convenient route from Boston
to the far west.

Jan. 9. On Thursday, the 9th of January, the citizens
with one accord devoted the day to the funeral solemnities,
closing their shops, and suspending all business

ever exhibited in the city. Civic. Military and Masonic
societies, Law, Physic and Divinity, everything turned
out on the occasion that ever was heard of before, and
much came from abroad.
The directors of the Western Inland Lock Navigation
company met on the 30th December, 1799, when the canals
and locks at Little Falls, German Flatts, and Fort
Stanwix being completed, and no further work of importance
intended to be prosecuted, it was found expedient
to provide money to discharge the debt due the
banks, for which purpose it was estimated that ten pounds
($25) on each share would be sufficient ; and that sum
was accordingly assessed.
The Legislature of the State, then sitting at Albany,
resolved to commemorate the virtues and talents of the
late General Washington, by setting apart the 22d day
of February, his birthday, to be observed in a religious
manner. The Rev. Messrs. Nott, Johnson, Ellison and
Bassett were chosen chaplains for the session, and it was

Daniel Steele advertised as just printed, The Albany
Collection of Sacred Harmony, containing a plain, and intelligible
instruction for learners of church music; together
with a lesson for every mood of time, and for
every key made use of in psalmody.
<p><a name=brown></a><b>For Sale</b>: That elegant fire proof House and Stores,
corner of State and Market streets, now in the possession
of Messrs. <a href="../bios/b/anbrown7448.html">Andrew Brown</a> & Co. The building is 38 ft.
6 in. breadth on Market street, and 64 ft. 6in. on State
street with excellent cellars 7 feet high under the whole,
and a spacious garret. The house on Market street is
three stories high with 13 rooms; the stores on State
street are five stories high, four of which are partitioned
for wheat, and may contain each from 3 to 4000 bushels.
The stonewalls are more than three feet thick, and the
brick walls are two and a half bricks thick up to the
roof, with three partition walls. The whole was built in
the summer of 1795, of entire hard bricks, to the number
of about 450,000. The very best materials have
been employed, and the best masons and carpenters the
country could afford. The situation is certainly the best
and most eligible one in the city for business, being in the
centre of trade, within sight and pistol shot of the dock,
and when the Dutch church is removed, which it is
supposed must very shortly take place, it will increase
the value of the property greatly, as it will then command
a full prospect of State street, through which all
the travellers from the western country come to town.
A law was passed by the Common Council " for filling
up Church street, parts of Lydius, Van Schee, Westerlo,
and Sturgeon streets, and parts of Bass and Herring
lanes, and all the lots from Court street westward to Dallius
street, and from Ferry street northward to the north
bounds of the church pasture."
On Saturday, July 11, Gov. Clinton and his family arrived
in Albany, and took up their residence at the house
recently occupied 
by Gov. Jay. A salute of cannon from
Fort Hill, announced his arrival. [The house occupied
by these two governors was the site of Nos. 66 and 68
State street, instead of 62, as stated in a previous volume.

<p>Notes from the Newspapers. 317
On Wednesday, Oct. 5th, at eleven o'clock in the
forenoon, the corner stone of the foundation of the United
Presbyterian church in this city, was laid by the Rev.
John McDonald, in presence of the trustees and ecclesiastical
officers of the congregation. After the stone was
fixed, accompanied by three strokes of the hammer, these
words were added :
" In the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, the king and head of the church, we solemnly
place this stone, the corner foundation of a sacred edifice,
for the public worship of God, an expression of the
piety of the United Presbyterian church in Albany.
Amidst considerable opposition from some, and encouraged
by the generous liberality of others, this infant
society, though neither distinguished for their numbers or
their wealth, has undertaken this expensive work, with
full dependence on God. United in faith and affection,
in pursuit and prospect they look to God for success," &c.
Several brethren of the order of Hospitallers of St. Camillus
de Lilies, from the St. Bernard, arrived in the city,
to obtain pecuniary assistance to enable them to continue
the exercise of those acts of benevolence for which they
had so long been celebrated. They stated that the merchants
of Switzerland and Italy had formerly contributed
sufficient sums annually for all their wants; but that the
wars for the last few years had not only cut off their income,
but that the contending armies had carried fire and
sword into their vicinity, and that all trade between Italy
and Switzerland had ceased. In this posture of their
affairs, the venerable prior of the order. Father Ignatius
Sperzoni, had sent several of his order to the United
States of America to implore the assistance of its generous
inhabitants to enable them to repair the convent and
hospital, and to continue to give assistance to the distressed
traveler and infirm poor.
Some years previous to this, a company was incorporated
to construct a turnpike road from Albany to Schenectady.
It was the first essay made in this state to
build a turnpike. In consequence, the law was defective,
and the sandy nature of the soil, and the difficulty of
obtaining hard materials, were considered insurmountable

<p>318 Notes from the Newspapers.
barriers in the way of success. The project was necessarily
abandoned, and the law suffered to expire, although
it was a complaint that the old road was the worst one
in the United States, and very few were so much used.
An effort was now again made to get up an excitement
on the subject. The roads throughout the country had
been greatly improved, and the citizens of Albany were
called upon to secure the travel to their city before it
should be diverted elsewhere by better roads, and lost to
them forever.
The Common Council fixed the price of wheat at 1 3s.
a bushel (T63), and bread at 2lb. 130*. 8dr., for Is. of
inspected flour, and Slbs. 7oz. of common flour for Is.
A convention of delegates appointed to revise the constitution
of the state, met at the Capitol on the 13th

Schenectady Turnpike. A meeting of citizens was
held at the City Tavern on the 3d November, which
was numerously attended, for the purpose of awakening
an interest in the project of constructing a turnpike to
Schenectady. A committee of nine was appointed to
prepare and digest a plan to be laid before the city at an
adjourned meeting.
On the 10th another meeting was held to hear the report
of the committee. The plan proposed was to divide
the stock into 2000 shares of 50 dollars each. The subscription
for 1400 shares was immediately opened and
subscribed for, leaving 600 shares for the city of Schenectady.
No person was allowed to subscribe more than
ten shares, nor permitted to transfer his stock within a
year after an act of incorporation should be obtained.
This was to prevent speculation. Five years previous,

<p>Notes from the Newspapers. 319
when a charter had been obtained, and the books opened
for subscriptions, not a share was taken up !
On the 24th November a meeting of the stockholders
was held, when the Hon. John Lansing, jr., was elected
president of the company, and Stephen Van Rensselaer,
Stephen Lush, Daniel Hall, John Taylor, Garret W. Van
Schaick, Dudley Walsh, Abraham Oothout, Joseph C.
Yates, directors.

Jan. 3. Divine service was performed in the new church
belonging to the united Presbyterian congregation in this
city. [This church edifice still occupies the corner of
Canal and Chapel streets.]
By a meteorological table published in the Gazette of
Feb. 1, it appears that the lowest range of the thermometer
was 10 degs., and the highest 55.^ degs. above zero.
The winter was so remarkably mild as to have more the
appearance of April; the river was navigable 17 days so
that vessels passed from Albany to New York, and at no
time was the ice strong enough for any team to pass on
it, and not more than 1^ inches of snow fell within two
miles of the city during the months of December and
January.
The highest range of the thermometer for February
was 54 degs. ; the lowest 6 degs. below zero.
Feb. 29. John W. Wendell, keeper of the Hotel in

pipes, 6 inches in diameter, laid from the creek to the reservoir
June 10. A bass of uncommon size, taken in our river,
was yesterday brought to our market. Its weight was
55 pounds. We believe this is the largest fish ever caught
in the Hudson, the sturgeon alone excepted. It was
bought by Mr. Jared Skinner for four dollars and fifty
cents.
The Legislature passed an act incorporating Goldsbrow
Banyar, Abraham Ten Eyck, Abraham Ten Broeck and
others, a body corporate and politic, by the name of the
president, directors and company of the Albany and
Schenectady Turnpike. The stock was fixed at 2000
shares at $50 each. By a subsequent act this road was
brought into the city as far as Snipe street.
The company appropriated the revenue of the year
1801 to facilitate a communication from the canal at Rome
to the junction of Wood and Canada creeks, and to remove
the obstructions on the Onondaga and Seneca rivers,
which it was thought would be a good investment to the
company, and a great public accommodation.
An ordinance passed the Common Council against
ringing or tolling bells at funerals, for a longer time than
twenty minutes, under a penalty of 25 dollars.

Canal. It appears that there was great difficulty in
getting the stock paid in for this work, and that those
who gave their energies to the work were much embarrassed
thereby. The state had advanced money to carry
on the project, and this year a law was passed forfeiting
the installments already paid in by those who had failed
to meet the calls of the company since 1796, and investing
the state's money in the stock of the company. The
following table of tolls was given by the Albany Centinel,
as having been taken at Little Falls:
In 1796 the nett toll collected was $1759'50
1797 2350-26
1798 2938-26
1799 2500-24
1800 ... 5087-43
1801 9490-33
The tolls for the present year were supposed to have
doubled those of last year for the same period. The tolls
collected at Rome had averaged about $2000 a year since
1797. The tolls had been reduced at some points 50 per
cent, which so far from diminishing the product, had
tended to increase it.
A company consisting of some of the most respectable
moneyed men, was formed for exploring, opening and
working coal mines, and all the necessary tools and implements
prepared for prosecuting the work vigorously.
It appears that some persons professing an acquaintance
with coal formations, had observed indications of coal in
this vicinity; and although attempts had before been
made to discover it, they were supposed to have failed of
success for want of sufficient effort. It was intended
now to make a fair trial, and the location decided upon
for the experiment was Wendell's creek a little to the
west of the city, where appearances were supposed to indicate
strongly that large and extensive quarries of the
mineral would be found.
Timothy Shalor, Money Broker, negotiated approved
notes, payable at the Bank of Albany.
John Jauncey also advertised that he continued to ' ; negotiate
all approved notes which had from 30, 60, or 90 days

A contract was entered into by the Albany and Schenectady
turnpike company, for clearing the track of the
road, building fences fifty-eight feet apart, and forming an
arch 42 feet broad, with ditches of eight feet on each
side, for $26,000. The road was to form a perfectly
straight line, and not to exceed in depression or elevation,
four degrees from a horizontal line, 14 miles in
length. A delegation of the principal sachems and warriors of
the Seneca nation of Indians from Buffalo creek visited
the city and concluded a treaty by which they ceded to
the state all the lands reserved along the Niagara river,
including Blackrock and the carrying place at the falls ;
an important acquisition.

The legislature incorporated a new bank in the city of
Albany, with a capital of 500,000 dollars, under the title
of the New York State Bank. At a meeting of the directors
on the 25th March, John Tayler was chosen
president, and John W. Yates cashier.
Among the acts passed by the legislature this year,
was one "
to straighten the public highway leading from
the city of Albany to the Ballstown springs."
Christopher Dunn gave notice that he had taken the
tavern in Green street, formerly occupied by David Trowbridge,
and put the interior in thorough repair, and that
it would be his utmost ambition to merit and preserve
the good opinion of all those who would favor him with
their custom. " N. B. The original stage office kept
here." [Dunn was famous for his jokes, and his Coffee
House was resorted to till about the year 1830, when the
street was widened and his house was cut in two. He
died pievious to, or about that time.]

Aug. 7. Rev. John B. Johnson, a minister of the Reformed
Dutch church, died at Newtown, Long Island,
aged 33. In consequence of impaired health, he had
withdrawn from the cares of a large congregation at Albany,
and accepted a call where less exertion was required;
but his disease was too deeply rooted, and the
change proved ineffectual to his relief. After the death
of his wife, who left him in April, with three infant
children, he rapidly declined, and his complaints terminated
in consumption. He was distinguished by abilities
which marked him for extensive usefulness, |and his
mind was improved by a liberal education, and indefatigable
study.

wenches, one free from ever having had a husband
or child, and one not in the least used to black company,
and free from every vice of any moment ; will please to
inquire of the editors of this paper, from whom they may
know the price, and the present owner."
In February of this year, Robert McClellan, a respectable
merchant, and treasurer of the state, proved a defaulter
to a large amount. He published a justification
cf his defalcation, alledging that he was a loser to a very
heavy amount by the state, in the war of the Revolution,
in consequence of having outlayed money in clothing [<b>325</b>] and stores for the army, imported from Canada, and that  he had been embarrassed by those operations ever since.

<p>The ladies and gentlemen of Albany were informed that I. Wood had taken rooms at Mrs, Dole's, next door to the Albany Coffee House, corner of Green and Beaver streets, where he would take likenesses in profile, at five minutes sitting, at a dollar, by a process which he dignified with the name of Physiognotrace.

A bill was brought
before the legislature at
its session this year, authorizing
the city corporation
to sell the old
Court House on the corner
of Hudson and Court
streets, and erect a new
one on the public square
at the head of State
street. Most of the other
states had already erected
public buildings for
the accommodation of
their respective legislatures,
and public purposes,
while the opulent
state of New York was still without any such convenience,
but met in a building which had long served
the double purpose of court house and jail; and although
the jail had been removed some time previous to this, the
edifice was occupied for city and county purposes, as well
as those of the state. In it criminals had been incarcerated,
tried and executed. The whipping post stood before
it many years.
March 5. There was a great depth of snow upon the
ground in this vicinity, the like whereof was unknown to
the oldest inhabitant; being about three feet on a level.

Nott in the Presbyterian church, in aid of the funds of
the Humane society, established by the ladies of the city,
for the "
relief of poor women and small children."

the most liberal ever taken up in any of the city churches.
Contracts were executed in the beginning of this year
for the construction of a turnpike road from Hoboken to
Hackensack, to be commenced early in the spring, and
completed in November. This was to form a link in a
great chain of roads, which were to connect the cities of
Albany and New York on the west side of the river. It
was thought that by connecting it with the great state
road, to be opened in the spring between Goshen and
Albany, the distance would be materially shortened, and
the preference given to this route over any other, by the
rapidly increasing travel between the two cities. [There
was at this time as great a rage for turnpikes, as there
has been at any time since for canals or rail roads.]
Feb. 4. Benjamin V. Henry, a merchant of Albany,
died at the island of Jamaica.
