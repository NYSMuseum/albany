<p>"Naturalization" is an often-used term in early American history! We define it here to mean the process by which someone born outside of the British empire was made a British subject. After the Revolution, it means American citizenship for foreign-born residents. In general, it refers to a "foreigner!" The term has been defined further by the 
<a href="http://www.archives.nysed.gov/holding/fact/natur-fa.htm#colo">New York State Arhives</a>.</p>

<p>In 1664, a number of New Netherlanders <a href="#1664">swore allegiance</a> to England. Among this group was surgeon <a href="bios/s/abstaats.html">Abraham Staats</a>, patroon <a href="bios/vr/jevr.html">Jeremias Van Rensselaer</a>, and his brother <a href="bios/vr/rivr5057.html">Richard</a>.</p>

      <p>In its early Albany context, the term "naturalization" relates to those men 
        and widows who were not born in New York colony or its Dutch predecessor. 
        "Freemanship" or "Freedom of the city" is a more specific designation 
        bestowed on those born within the city of Albany or else "licensed" to 
        conduct business in the city. "Freeholders" were those adult men who <a href="lists/list1720.html">owned 
        property</a> (mostly real estate) within the <a href="citylimits.html">boundaries</a> 
        of Albany. The "Burghers & Freemen" of New York City are listed <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=%22burghers+and+freemen%22&source=web&ots=W4zL6h-NDG&sig=jgYAaGL-vhXYjpAzBa2ydE2OjSg#PPR7,M1">online</a>.</p> 

      <p>Between 1715 and 1717 and afterwards as well, the royal government of New York 
"naturalized" its 
        foreign-bon residents. This was designed to make British subjects of the 
        large number of recently-arrived German Palantine emigres. Scots and Scots-Irish 
        newcomers were British subjects by birth! Included in this large group 
        were a number of aged New Netherland-ancestry residents of Albany including 
        <a href="bios/t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck</a>, <a href="bios/l/jolansing3440.html">Jan 
        Lansing</a>, old <a href="bios/l/omlg5927.html">Omie La Grange</a>, the widow <a href="bios/r/irlydius4613.html">Isabella 
        Lydius</a> and her daughters, and Dominie <a href="bios/vd/pevdriessen6692.html">Petrus Van Driessen</a>. We believe that they had been born in continental 
        Europe. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#v=onepage&q&f=false">1716</a>, naturalizations were performed before the Albany city council.</p>

<p>After the <a href="7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>, the British (through the province of New York) naturalized additional groups of newcomers. These were mostly Germans and French immigrants. Albany residents included <a href="bios/a/joabbott6354.html">John James Abbott</a>, <a href="bios/y/peyoung.html">Peter Young</a>.</p>
