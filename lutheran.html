They were counted among the <a href="nnd.html">New Netherland Dutch</a> although they were mostly of German and Scandinavian backgrounds. The earliest Albany-area Lutherans included members of the <a href="bios/b/bradt.html">Bradt</a>, <a href="bios/d/douw.html">Douw</a>, <a href="bios/g/gansevoort.html">Gansevoort<a>, </a></a><a><a href="bios/l/lagrange.html">La Grange</a>, and <a href="bios/vi/vi.html">Myndertse/Van Iveren</a> families.</a></p><a>

<p>Albany's Lutherans <a href="#sources">date</a> their establishment as a church to 1649. However, records and verifiable resources for the earliest years are sparse and conflicting as the earliest Lutheran organizers chiefly were engaged in attempting to secure freedom to worship in New Netherland. After 1664, worship was less restrictive if only as the <a href="newcomers.html">new</a>comers under the English represented more diverse religious traditions.</p>

<p>The Reverend <a href="bios/f/fabritius.html">Jacobus Fabritius</a> came to New York and held what is said to be the first Lutheran service in Albany on April 25, 1669. His tenure was brief and he was followed by Reverend <a href="bios/a/barnzius.html">Bernard Arnzius</a> in 1671. During the 1670s, the English solidified their hold on New York - thus providing Lutherans with more spiritual freedom.</p>

<p><a href="#detail"><img src="images/jpg/1695lutherandetail.jpg" align=left border=2 vspace=1 hspace=5 width=150 alt="Lutheran church in 1695"></a>By 1680, the Albany Lutherans had <a href="#deed">purchased</a> a house and two lots - the adjoining parcels to be used as a <a hrefdead.html">burial ground</a>. The first church was built shortly thereafter on the south side of Albany, west of today's South Pearl Street, and just above the <a href="loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> as it meandered downhill on its way to the Hudson.

<p>Sharing Pastor Arnzius with Lutherans in New York and along the Hudson, the Albany church was run more by its lay leaders who were called deacons. 
            As few of Albany's wealthier residents were members, the Albany Lutheran 
            church was unable to raise sufficient funds to support a resident 
            pastor. This problem became chronic and was not remedied until after 
            the <a href="or/or-3r.html">Revolutionary War</a>.</p>

<p>With the death of Bernard Arnzius in 1691, the Albany Lutheran church was without any pastor until May 1704 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justus_Falckner">Justus Falckner</a> first arrived in Albany. However, Falckner's responsibilities were more than province-wide and prevented him from spending significant time in the upriver community. Over the past decade, the Albany congregation had dwindled as most of the pioneer elders had died and their children seem to have been drawn to the more mainstream <a href="drc.html">Dutch Reformed church</a>. At the same time, many of the more faithful Lutherans had spread out into the countryside of greater <a href="albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.</p>  

<p>Although most years he made only an annual trip to Albany, Falckner sought to rebuild the Lutheran congregation at Albany. The earliest surviving records date from Falckner's time. He also ministered to Albany's Anglicans until the arrival of Reverend <a href="bios/b/tbarclay.html">Thomas Barclay</a> in 1708. Anglican services were held in the Lutheran church until St. Peter's English church was built several years later.</p>

<p>With Falckner's time shared with New York and Hackensack, the Albany congregation continued to decline. During the <a href="peace.html">three decades of peace</a>, newly arrived and established Lutherans continued to move to the more outlying regions with Loonenburg (today's Athens) becoming the Lutheran center of the upriver region.</p>

<p>Justus Falckner died in 1723. In 1731, Falckner was succeeded by Wilhelm Christoph Berkenmeyer who served in simultaneously in a number of locations until his death in October 1751. Berkenmeyer's <a href="#protocol">chronicle</a> of Lutheran activities in New York provide an important window on the Albany church and point up the Albany congregation's subordinate role in the development of Lutheran culture in the Hudson Valley. The church building had <a href="#vandal">ceased to exist</a> and the infrequent services were held in the home of leading Lutheran <a href="bios\e\joeverts7967.html">Jan Evertse</a> and others.</p>

            <p>In 1742, <a href="bios/l/phlivingston86.html">Philip Livingston</a>, 
              the owner of an adjoining lot, <a href="#enabled">enabled</a> the 
              Albany Lutherans to build a "parish" or "church house" on the church 
              site. With no resident pastor, it was rented to deacon Evertse.</p> 

<p>In the decades that followed, several itinerant pastors preached in Albany - although none of them actually lived in the city! Chief among them were Nicholas Sommer, Bavarian <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Schwerdtfeger-41">John W. S. Schwerdfeger</a>, and <a href="bios/h/jochartwick.html">John 
              C. Hartwick</a>. Despite his loyalist sympathies, <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Schwerdtfeger-41">Schwerdfeger</a> 
              served the Albany Lutherans during the Revolutionary war from his 
              home across the river in Brunswick. He later settled in Canada! <a href="inprog.html"><img src="images/jpg/inprog.jpg" height=10 width=10 alt="more to come"></a> 
            </p> 

          <p>In August 1784, the Albany Lutheran church was reorganized. Reverend Heinrich 
            Moeller served from 1784-90 and again in 1802-06. A new church was 
            built on the old site in 1786. In 1795, it was described as "of a 
            Gothic and very peculiar construction." Local lore tells us that stone 
            from the <a href="loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> was used in its construction.

<p>During the 1600s and 1700s, Albany's Lutherans were chiefly of German or Scandinavian ancestry. Mostly, its members were middling representatives of the production and service <a href="econ/comec.html">economies</a> and included an even larger number of regional farmers. Without a pastor for most of the colonial period, the Lutheran church served as a German cultural center in Albany. After the Revolutionary War, the church became more solidly established.</p>
