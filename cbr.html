<P><font size=-1><blockquote><dd><b>C</b>entral to the inside-out approach of the community historian is a comprehension of the actual community record. That enables us to consider the story of the people of colonial Albany in their own terms. 

<p><dd><b>E</b>ach of the lifecourse <a href="pcalhindex.html#biographies">biographies</a> presented by the Colonial Albany Social History Project is based on the research conducted by the project in a systematic search of historical resources over the past two decades. Structuring that long term effort is a comprehensive guide to project operations entitled <a href="#guide"><i>The People of Colonial Albany: A Community History Project</i></a> (1994 edition).<br>
<dd>Since most of the 16,000 historical characters that make up the early Albany study population never wrote anything, our work relies chiefly on the records generated by a range of community-based organizations and institutions. Relevant portions of the records of external organizations and institutions have been tapped as well. Beyond that, we have and will continue to utilize literary sources, material remains, and archeological resources in our effort to understand the people of colonial Albany and their world.

<p>This page <a href="inprog.html">begins</a> to identify the resources used to construct our basic "People of Colonial Albany" lifecourse biographies. Listed below are six general categories of information used to organize and articulate historical research:</blockquote></font size>

         <blockquote><font size=-1><b>Parameters and Emphasis:</b> The presentation of biographies on this website follows several agendas! Generally speaking, what we do is guided by four practical considerations:
<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> 
      was established to answer questions about the people of the city during 
      the <a href="or/or.html">era of the Revolution</a>, new research and subsequent 
      web presentations must be focused on individuals who lived during that time. 
      Expect to see more web features that address the lives of the so-called 
      "revolutionary generation" than anything else. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Second, because fewer sources exist, we do not expect to be able to comprehend the lives of those who lived in the community during its formative years (prior to about 1680.) in ways comparable to what we can know about those born in America. This has to do with the comparative absence of institutions and (even more so) their records for the earliest period. We do, however, have much heretofore unpresented information and perspectives covering that period that are basic to understanding the life of the city after 1686. Although the early period is not our emphasis, we offer dozens of web features that appear nowhere else!  

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, research potentials (the paper trail) are so much more fertile for the period after 1800 that we struggle to resist the temptation to focus on people and the community that existed in the decades after the American Revolution. A cardinal sin here (and one rarely avoided by our predecessors), has been to present <a href="victorian.html">Victorian perspectives</a> on pre-industrial life - and to have those represent the history of the eighteenth century community.

<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourth, at the heart of our inquiry and exposition 
      are the lives of the diverse, everyday people (permanent and longterm residents) 
      who make up the early Albany mainline. <a href="art/art-bbpast.html">Community 
      History</a> is biased toward the "regulars" or "stayers." Our research design 
      accords their lives the highest priority. Many other individuals visited 
      or briefly lived in early Albany - <a href="criteria.html">technically qualifying 
      them</a> for inclusion in the study population. Some of those people (for 
      example, <a href="bios/j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a> and <a href="bios/m/jmiller.html">Reverend 
      John Miller</a> left extensive records of their lifetimes - mostly beyond 
      the city limits. We resist the temptations to tell their out-of-Albany stories 
      and instead to focus on their lives while in the community. <br>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, some of the features presented on this website exist chiefly to provide answers to issues in the lives of the core people, places, and things that make up the early Albany story. They may never be more than skeletal sketches!

    <p><a name=guide><b>The Guide:</b> <a href="bios/staff/sbbio.html">Stefan Bielinski</a>, 
      <i>The People of Colonial Albany: A Community History Project</i></a> (1994 
      edition), 168 total pages, illustrations, appendices. <br>
      <dd>The <i>Guide</i> is organized into sections beginning with project definitions and goals; and including comprehensive expositions on historical resources; data analysis; programming (presentation of historical materials); and services (how the project interacts with the larger historical community).

<br><dd>The <i>Guide</i> describes each type historical resource utilized and articulates a strategy and plan for present and future research. Each individual resource is described in detail. The overall research design and <b>all</b> relevant resources are discussed in section 2, pages 2-63.

<br><dd>We have begun to make the <i>Guide</i> an <b><a href="guide/titletable.html">online resource</a></b>. Currently, the most recent printed edition (1994) is <a href="pub.html#guide">available</a> in paper form. 
<a name=demo></a>
<p><b>Demographics:</b> Birth information is derived from church records, bible records, legal documents (such as marriage licenses and <a href="pcalhindex.html#wills">probate materials</a>), obituaries, and cemetery recordings.</p>

<p><a name=stand></a><b>Community Standing:</b> These lists of Albany people include <a href="pcalhindex.html#census">censuses</a>, assessment rolls, membership and participation lists and rosters, and other surveys of all or parts of the early Albany community. Information from these sources was  processed first as they included the largest proportion of community members.</p>

<p><a name=act></a>
            <b>Activities:</b> This category includes information recovered systematically 
            from records resources on work history, dealings with <a href="corporation.html">public</a> 
            and private institutions (<a href="churches.html">churches</a> and 
            the <a href="garrison.html">military</a>) and organizations (membership 
            groups such as the <a href="org/masonic.html">Masons</a> and the <a href="ams.html">Albany 
            Mechanics Society</a>), and the courts. 
            <p><a name=prop></a><b>Property:</b> Includes information on real 
              property, ships, and other assets including <a href="afroalbanians.html">slaves</a>. 
              Deeds and other conveyances, maps, and newspaper and other descriptions 
              are important resources for these areas.</p>
            <p><a name=lit></a><b>Literary Sources:</b> Interpretive information 
              retrieved from letters, <a href="res/visitors.html">observations</a>, 
              journals, and accounts, and from reminiscent sources such as memoirs. 
              These resources are not records but impressions remembered and recorded 
              by an individual observer.</p>
            <p><a name=mc></a><b>Material Culture:</b> Thousands of images of 
              relevant people, places, and things from many sources have been 
              copied and are held in a variety of formats in the project <a href="grapharch.html">Graphics 
              Archive</a>. Images and imaging is further discussed in a webpage 
              <a href="cuyler.html">theme essay</a> and a recent <a href="art/art-pp.html">conference 
              paper</a>. Maps online are <a href="pcalhindex.html#map">indexed</a>.
