      <p>Shelter was of immediate and constant concern for the <a href="criteria.html">people</a> 
        of colonial Albany. From the earliest days, house building and renovation 
        were ongoing and followed practical needs. After the initial framing and 
        roofing, early Albany homes underwent constant adaptation and enlargement. 
      <p>Beginning during the 1640s, mostly wooden, hastily erected cottages housed new <a href="furtrade.html">fur traders</a> as they came together along the riverfront - north of <a href="loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>. By the time of the English takeover in 1664 (and a name change from <a href="beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> to Albany), a <a href="map/map1676.html">wooden stockade</a> enclosed what had become a <a href="econ/comec.html">community of interest</a> that may have included a hundred permanent if 
  not particularly distinguished buildings. These small structures were sited 
  on narrow, water level houselots and fronted along Albany's two <a href="streets.html#state">main 
  streets</a>.

<p><a href="loc/schuylerhouse.html"><img src="images/schuylerhouse200.jpg" align=left width=200 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Schuyler house - corner of State and South Pearl"></a> By the 1670s, <a href="bios/s/phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse Schuyler</a> and other successful Albany traders were building more substantial <a href="loc/schuylerhouse.html">brick homes</a> on those same choice locations and farther up the hill to house growing families and business operations as well. Still small by modern standards, gabled, brick townhouses were erected in Albany through succeeding generations. These were roughly styled on European urban models. As <a name=kalm></a><a href="art/kalm.html#neat">time 
        passed</a>, these structures were enlarged, altered, and were passed through 
        early Albany families - often for several generations. Some of those classic 
        buildings <a href="images/jpg/schuylerhousephoto.jpg">survived</a> into 
        the late nineteenth century - a testimony to their durability if not their 
        viability. For the next 150 years, traditional and newly anointed Albany 
        leaders continued to replace and reconfigure urban homesteads on the same 
        lots along the main <a href="streets.html">streets</a> of the city's core.

      <p><a href="loc/vdhpalace.html"><img src="images/jpg/bldg/vdhpalace.jpg" alt="Vanderheyden Palace - built 1725" align=left border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200 height=130></a>However, as Albany grew from about <a href="census1697.html">180 buildings</a> 
  in 1700, to more than <a href="census1756.html">330 in 1756</a>, and upwards 
  of 600 in 1779, most of the new structures were somewhat less distinguished, 
  mostly wooden, and erected on Albany's <a href="loc/southside.html">back streets</a> or along the outlying extensions 
  of Market, State, and Pearl streets.<a name=yh></a><a href="#yates"><img src="images/jpg/yateshse.jpg" width=150 height=155 align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Robert Yates house on upper State Street"></a> 
  These smaller buildings filled in vacant lots within the stockaded city and 
  were erected by younger sons of <a href="familynames.html">traditional families</a>, 
  discharged <a href="garrison.html#resident">garrison soldiers</a>, and some 
  individual <a href="newcomers.html">newcomers</a> who could contribute useful 
  talents to an expanding and evolving community. These more ordinary buildings 
  were clustered around the inns at the intersection of Green and Beaver Streets, 
  along Pearl Street, and on the <a href="images/jpg/tantillo.jpg">waterfront</a>.

<p> <a href="#frame"><img src="images/framehouses.jpg" width=200 height=130 border=1 align=left space=4 vspace=4 alt="frame houses on North Pearl Street"></a>By the end of the last <a href="7yw.html">French and Indian War</a> in 1763, newcomers from Europe and the other American colonies began to replace traditional families on city rolls. For the first time, the city's population included a large and growing group of <a href="newcomers.html">new 
  people</a>. Most of these new Albanians were of modest means and some of them 
  rented, bought, or married into an existing city house. Others became boarders 
  or lodged at the inns that sprang up on virtually every street. Needing more space, still others 
  erected new homes <a href="na/whitehall.html">beyond</a> the old urban core. 
  On the <a href="lastdays.html">eve</a> of the American Revolution, the community 
  had spread out along the river from beyond <a href="loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
  Creek</a> to the <a href="loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>, on the high ground 
  beyond the <a href="loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>, and along the <a href="loc/kingshighway.html">Schenectady 
  road</a>. With the building of the city docks, dismantling of the stockade, 
  and a dramatic influx of new people, Albany had become an early American <a href="earlycity.html">city</a>.

<p><a href="#92state"><img src="images/jpg/stevensonhsebw.jpg" width=200 height=130 border=1 align=left space=4 vspace=4 alt="Upper State Street home of John Stevenson"></a>At the same time, State, Market, and Court Streets were undergoing redevelopment. 
        Beginning with the new <a href="loc/cityhall.html">city hall</a> erected 
        during the 1740s, new core <a href="bios/s/jostevenson2244.html#home">buildings</a> were wider than their predecessors 
        - enveloping two or more houselots, were block shaped, and reached up 
        another floor accommodate combined business, production, and residential 
        functions. For the first time, some new and old buildings were used exclusively 
        as stores, shops, and storehouses. This separation of home and workplace 
        became more pronounced as a number of Albany people including one-time mayor <a href="bios/d/vopdouw2234.html">Volkert 
        P. Douw</a> who crossed the river from his home at Wolvenhook to the family 
        store on Court Street or blacksmith <a href="bios/y/chjyates4459.html">Christopher 
        J. Yates</a>, whose smithy and stables were in the Third Ward and his 
        home and farmhouse in <a href="na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.

<p>With the coming of peace in 1783, Albany became an American boomtown as New Englanders and Europeans flooded into New York on their way to new homes in the West.</p>
 

<p>Some of these newcomers settled in Albany and provided energy and resources for the growth and development of a new city that became the permanent capital of New York State in 1797. By that time, Albany's population had reached almost 6,000 and the city was in the midst of a building boom that would provide homes and jobs for a <a href="population.html">population</a> that would reach 9,356 by 1810 and more than 24,000 by 1830.

      the early nineteenth century. Colonial Albany Project <a href="grapharch.html">Graphics

      <p><a name=ewpearl></a>West side of <b>North <a href="streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a></b> as it appeared in 1805 showing some popular early Albany 
        house types. Adapted from a print of a watercolor painted by <a href="bios/e/jaeights2036.html">James 
        Eights</a> about 1850. Collection of the <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/history/collections/hiscollect.html">New 
        York State Museum</a>. 
      <p>The stately structure on the far left was built by <a href="bios/w/hunwood.html">Dr. 
        Hunlock Woodruff</a> on the northwest corner of <a href="streets.html#maiden">Maiden 
        Lane</a> after his marriage to Maria Lansing in 1779. Woodruff saw patients 
        in the small, frame buildings to the right. James Eights grew up in the 
        adjoining stepgabled house whose main floor was elevated to protect against 
        flooding. Eights remembered <a href="bios/t/rithompson.html">Richard Thompson</a> 
        (note the name plate over the door), an Afro Albanian grocer living on 
        the other side. The tall, elevated building north of Thompson’s was the 
        <a href="bios/g/groesbeck.html">Groesbeck family</a> home. But Eights 
        would have remembered its 19th century occupant - Widow Sturdivant. The 
        yellow brick home on the right was built for <a href="bios/y/chyates4463.html">Dr. 
        Christopher C. Yates</a>.

        occupied the dwelling at 110 State Street (on the South side facing <a href="stpeters.html">St. 
        Peters church</a>) which sat on a twenty-four-by-eighteen-foot lot. It 
        was demolished in 1855. See <a href="books.html#aarch"><i>Albany Architecture</i></a>, 
        51. The engraving was printed in the <a href="books.html#ht"><i>Bicentennial

At <a href="map/bogertmap.html">74 feet</a> on the street, it was almost three times as wide as its adjoining neighbors. Unlike the gabel-facing State Street buildings, what James Eights later would title it "a rich man's dwelling," the Stevenson house was oriented is what today would be called "ranch style."</p>
