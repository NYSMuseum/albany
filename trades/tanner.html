The tanner stood between hunters and butchers (the suppliers of skins) and leatherworkers who made commercial products from the tanned hides. While few early Albany people would have considered tanning to be their primary occupation, many butchers and leather workers had some first-hand experience with the operation. Merchants also owned tanning pits and then tanneries. Throughout the pre-industrial era, tanners were an important part of early Albany's <a href="../makers.html">Production Economy</a>!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning">tanning process</a> required a supply of <a href="#skins">skins</a>, a supply of <a href="http://www.braintan.com/barktan/2tannins.htm">tannin</a>, a tanning pit (preferably near a supply of running water), a location away from densely inhabited areas, on-call labor to scrape and flush the skins, and patience as many months might pass before yielding an acceptable leather product. <a href="http://www.cortinaleathers.com/howleather.html">Many steps</a> were employed to turn skins into leather - although the number and order seem to be variable. </P>

<p><a href="#leather">Leather-related</a> trades probably were the most prevailent production activity in early Albany. Leather workers sometimes operated their own tanning pits. By the early 1700s, tanning pits were located along <a href="../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> to take advantage of the stream's running water. 

<p><a href="leather.html">Leatherworkers</a> often owned or operated tanning pits to help ensure a supply of hides. As early as 1681, shoemaker <a href="../bios/vs/covschell6431.html">Cornelis Van Schelluyne</a> also owned a tannery outside Albany's north gate. 

<p>The third ward assessment roll in <a href="../lists/list1779tlm.html#tan">1779</a> noted two tan yards.

<p>After the Revoilution, <a href="../bios/vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a>'s Bethlehem farm included tannery and brew house - both of which probably drew water from the Normanskill. His brother-in-law, merchant <a href="../bios/l/ablansing3694.html">Abraham A. Lansing</a>, produced leather used to make <a href="../firemasters.html">fire</a>bucktets. Tanner <a href="../bios/w/dawinne2849.html">Daniel K. Winne</a> held a number of lots along Foxes Creek. Cordwainer <a href="../bios/e/beevertse7954.html">Bernardus Evertsen</a> also was among the Foxes Creek tanners.

<p>By the 1790s, newcomer <a href="../bios/c/wmcharles7590.html">William Charles</a> and his <a href="../bios/c/geocharles7588.html">son</a> were butchers and tanners whose operations utilized the <a href="../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. By the early nineteenth century, more elaborate tanneries were located in the <a href="../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of the city.


<p>In 1813, a Gazetteer <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=04XZm53FyVIC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false">reported</a> 31 tanneries in Albany County.

<p>This page will evolve a more early Albany specific discussion of the tanning process and its practicioners!</p></font size>
