<p>This page provides basic access to information and people who made up the legal community in Albany. Our <a href="../guide/intro.html">approach</a> is <a href="../res/bios.html">bio</a>graphical in nature. A few practicioners were well educated and well-trained in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iYTEk5qdKWYC&pg=PP7&dq=colonial+lawyers&sig=YOAh_KD0X_PVc6sC2BEky1IpQLc">law</a>. However, most would-be Albany lawyers took a more practical approach to litigation and legal matters.

<p>Beginning during the earliest days of the settlement, <a href="../cityfathers.html">prominent</a> community members represented themselves and their less articulate neighbors and kin before local courts.

<p>Notaries and justices such as the tragic <a href="../bios/vi/ajvilp.html">Adrian Janse Van Ilpendam</a> were parts of the Albany legal community.

<p>Reputedly trained in England, former garrison officer <a href="../bios/c/jcollins.html">John Collins</a> was Albany's first professional attorney. 

<p>Colonial legal profession. <a href="../bios/c/wmcorry.html">William Corry</a> left an extensive practice (caseload) when he died suddenly in 1763. <a href="../bios/s/psilvester.html">Peter Silvester</a> followed him in Albany until relocating to Kinderhook during the War for Independence.

<p><a href="../bios/y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> had a number of proteges.

<p>Native son and Yale graduate <a href="../bios/l/wmlivingston.html">William Livingston</a> was trained in New York and represented Albany before the provincial government on many occasions during the 1750s and 60s.

<p>New Yorker <a href="../bios/l/stlush416.html">Stephen Lush</a>.

<p>Era of the American Revolution. <a href="../bios/b/aaburr.html">Aaron Burr</a>, <a href="../bios/t/rotroup.html">Robert Troup</a>, and Alexander Hamilton all lived in Albany in 1780.

<p>Albany mainstay <a href="../bios/y/ryates.html">Robert Yates</a> was a reknowned surveyor, lawyer, and jurist.

<p><a href="../bios/vv/abvvechten2378.html">Abraham Van Vechten</a> - jurist.</p>

<p>After graduating from Princeton in 1782, Kingston native <a href="../bios/e/peelmen.html">Peter E. Elmendorf</a> was an attorney in Albany (and a son-in-law of the Van Rensselaers) for the better part of his long life.

<p>A number of <a href="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=lawyers+early+america&aq=f&aqi=g-b1&aql=&oq=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=3ece4bbf7ce578bb&biw=1376&bih=440">online resources</a> further describe the law and legal profession in early America!</p>
