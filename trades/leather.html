<P>The tradesmen or artisans who made useful propducts from processed animal hides probably represented the largest single segment of the early Albany <a href="../makers.html">production</a> economy.

<p>These were early Albany's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoemaking">shoe</a> and bootmakers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cordwainer">cordwainers</a>, harness and saddlemakers. Cobblers repaired shoes and boots. By-products were produced by candlemakers, soapmakers, . [ This is <a href="../inprog.html">only</a> a preliminary list. ]

<p>Follow this 
 <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+shoemaker">link</a> to more information about shoes and shoemakers on this website. In 1756, twenty-one individuals were identified as shoemakers on a <a href="../census1756.html">census</a> of householders taken by the British army.

<p>Frequently, early Albany leatherworkers also were involved in the <a href="tanner.html">production</a> of the leather they later cobbled. Consequently, some of them operated tanning pits along <a href="../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.

<p>During the second decade of the nineteenth century, shoemaker <a href="../bios/vb/japvbt5384.html">James P. Van Benthuysen</a> (1772-1835) also was identified as a 
<a href="#last">lastmaker</a> (the forms or molds that shoemakers and cobblers used to hold shoes and boots). He practiced his trades and sold leather items in his shoestores on South Market and then on Division Street.</p>
