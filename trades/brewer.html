          <P><b>F</b>rom its earliest days, Albany supported a number of brewers who brewed 
            and sold beer to their neighbors and to those living in the countryside 
            as well. <a href="../im/im1686.html"><img src="../images/1686brewery.jpg" align=right border=1 width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="riverside  brewery of Albert Janse Ryckman - 1686"></a> 
            Brewing was an important part of the early Albany <a href="../econ/comec.html">community 
            economy</a>. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, a number 
            of individuals practiced the brewer's craft. We know the most about 
            the most successful!</P>

            <p>Brewing seems to have been a family-based enterprise. The <a href="../bios/g/gansevoort.html">Gansevoorts</a>, 
              <a href="../bios/r/ajryckman1905.html">Ryckmans</a>, and <a href="../bios/v/visscher.html">Visschers</a> 
              were prominent, long-term Albany brewers whose family prospered 
              in the business.</p>

<a href="../bios/v/btvisscher4063.html">Bastian T. Visscher</a> was an Albany/Rensselaerswyck  brewer of the middle part of the eighteenth century. He was one of five brewers identified on the Albany <a href="../census1756.html">census of 1756</a>.<p></p>

<P>Others continued to brew beer for personal consumption or limited distribution. <a href="../bios/vr/pvr.html#cherry">Philip Van Rensselaer's</a> south Albany estate included a "brew house."</p> 

<P>For a time in the eighteenth century (and possibly earlier), <a href="../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> was referred to as "Brewer's Street."
<p>Brewing became an important industry in Albany during the nineteenth century. Distilling and wine-making should be considered separately.</p>

<p>A number of <a href="http://www.beerhistory.com/library/holdings/greggsmith1.shtml">online resources</a> further describe the process!

            <p>Following extensive fieldwork, we have learned that local brewing is again 
              on the rise with several microbreweries operating in Albany today. 
              This <a href="http://www.google.com">search engine</a> will lead 
              you to advertising.

<p><a name=sources></a><b>Sources:</b> Ultimately, this discussion will be based more on verifiable (project identified) information on brewing during the 17th and 18th centuries in what became the city of Albany.
