<p>Physicians or "Physicks" prescribed and administered medicinal cures for all types of ailments. Surgeons removed the problem with a knife! Both types of medical practicioners lived in colonial Albany.</p>

<P>This important but complicated topic will be treated extensively in the months to come! For now, here are some of early Albany's outstanding medical practicioners:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/ktca/liberty/chronicle/medicine.html"><img src="../images/jpg/vein.jpg" align=left width=150 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="breathing a vein" ></a>The <a href="../bios/s/staats.html">Staatses</a> "operated" in seventeenth century Albany! The Van Dycks were their cure-driven counterparts! <a href="../bios/vt/abvtricht6599.html">Abraham Van Tricht</a> was a surgeon and coroner in Albany until his death in 1687.

<p>Scottish-trained, Maryland physican Dr. Alexander Hamilton <a href="../art/ham.html#med">commented</a> on the Albany medical community when he visited the area in 1744. His observations are telling: <i><a href="../art/ham.html#med2">"</a>A great many of them take the care of a family for the value of a Dutch dollar a year, which makes the practice of physick a mean thing, and unworthy of the application of a gentleman. The doctors here are all barbers.<a href="../art/ham.html#med2">"</a></i> 

<p>Trained in Boston, Albany native <a href="../bios/g/pegansevoort4670.html">Peter Gansevoort</a> practiced medicine in Albany throughout the second half of the eighteenth-century.  

<p>Dr. <a href="../bios/vd/hvdyck832.html">Henry Van Dyck</a> was one of the last of Albany's traditional physicians. Son, grandson, and great-grandson of an Albany physician, he served a great <a href="../wills/willhvdyck832.html#patients">cross-section</a> the city's society.</p>  

<p>Coming to Albany during the French and Indian War, Philadelphia-trained Dr. <a href="../bios/s/sastringer5046.html">Samuel Stringer</a> innoculated for smallpox!</p>

<p>The Revolutionary War brought a number of more "enlightened" physicians to Albany marking the beginning of the medical profession in the city. These  included Princeton-educated Continental army surgeon <a href="../bios/w/hunwood.html">Hunloke Woodruff</a> who became the partner of another relative newcomer named <a href="../bios/m/wilman.html">Wilhelmus Mancius</a>.</p>

<p>Other post war newcomers included Scottish-trained <a href="../bios/m/wmmcclelland.html">William Mc Clelland</a> and his partner and successor <a href="../bios/b/wmbay.html">William Bay</a>.
