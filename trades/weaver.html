<P><a href="#weaver"><b>W</b>eavers</a> made cloth from yarn in Albany for most of its formative years. Cloth was used locally and also as a barter item in the <a href="../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. Weavers provided a basic and essential part of the <a href="../earlycity.html">pre-industrial</a> city's <a href="../makers.html">production economy</a>.</P>

          <p><a href="#eact"><img src="../images/jpg/weavingeact.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Spinning and weaving in a colonial home" width=250></a>This 
            craft lent itself to <a href="../econ/famec.html">family-based enterprise</a> 
            as a number of essential tasks could be performed by women, children, 
            and the elderly.</p>

<p>By the 1720s, a small enclave of weavers had set up their looms on Albany's Southside. Chief among them were <a href="../bios/f/isfryer8033.html">Isaac</a> and Elizabeth Fryer.</p>
<a name=1756>
<p>In <a href="../census1756.html">1756</a>, the census of households identifed eight weavers living in the city. At that time, <a href="../bios/vz/jovzandt281.html">Johannes Van Zandt</a>, his son <a href="../bios/vz/jovzandt282.html">Johannes Van Zandt, Jr.</a>, alderman <a href="../bios/t/jotbroeck52.html">Johannes Ten Broeck</a>, <a href="../bios/vw/anvwoert2405.html">Andries Van Woert</a>, and others lived in close proximity on Albany's <a href="../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>.</p>

<p>In an urbanizing America, the individual weaver was superceded by the mill early in the Industrial Revolution.</p> 

<p>As late as 1815, the <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/albany/18152AlbanyDirectories.txt">city directory</a> identified four Albany residents as weavers.

<p><a name=weaver>The purpose of this exposition is to describe an essential part  of the early Albany production <a href="../econ/comec.html#pec">economy</a>. However, it is more concerned with the practitioners than the actual practice or products of weaving.</p>

          <p><a name=eact>This senario copied from a woodcut printed in <i>The Little Book 
            of Early American Crafts and Trades</i> (first <a href="http://store.doverpublications.com/0486233367.html">published</a> 
            in 1807) illustrates the family economy at work in the home! The man 
            is weaving at his loom. The woman is spinning yarn. One boy appears 
            to be stripping wood from a log. The other is making a basket from 
            the stripped wood. If those activities produced cloth or baskets for 
            sale, that work would be part of the community's <a href="../econ/comec.html#pec">production 
            economy</a>.</p>
