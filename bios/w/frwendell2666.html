      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Frances Wendell</strong></a> was born in 
        October 1752 and christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">D</a>utch 
        church. She was the daughter of John I./J. and Sara <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=szY7AAAAMAAJ&pg=RA7-PA421&lpg=RA7-PA421&dq">Bergen</a> 
        Wendell. We seek information on her background. Perhaps she was not a 
        member of the Albany <a href="wendell.html">W</a>endell family. 
      <p>In November 1771, "Santje Wendels" married Albany native <a href="../b/pebrooks2665.html">Peter 
        Brooks</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1790, the marriage had produced several children who were christened in 
        Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Over several decades, 
        she was a Dutch church member and pewholder. Their <a href="../b/pebrooks352.html">son</a> 
        became a mainline Albany resident. 
      <p>Perhaps these Brookses raised their family in <a href="../../census1790.html#2665">W</a>atervliet 
        or in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
      <p>Frances Wendell Brooks <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=%22Frances+Brooks,+wife+of+Peter+Brooks%22&source=bl&ots=Sr9xPNwmCm&sig=ynabBlt5hqMoeGsSMKxrDR6DdQk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUj77-1r3JAhUBWD4KHUBDDsYQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=%22Frances%20Brooks%2C%20wife%20of%20Peter%20Brooks%22&f=false">died</a> 
        in April 1818 and was buried in the Dutch church cemetery plot. She had 
        lived sixty-five years.</p>
