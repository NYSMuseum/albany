<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelia Waldron</strong></a> was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on December 2, 1702. She was the daughter of Manhattan born Albany newcomers <a href="pwaldron668.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../vd/cavdb5740.html">Tryntie Vandenbergh</a> Waldron.

<p>Older daughter Cornelia (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Neeltie) grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of a middling tradesman and aspiring trader.
 
<p>In July 1719, she married Albany native <a href="../b/dibradt3084.html">Dirck A. Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740, eleven children had been christened in the  church where the parents were pewholders and regular baptism sponsors.

<p>These Bradts raised their family in the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">West Manor</a> where Dirck A. Brat practiced the trade of the blacksmith. In <a href="../../sources.html#uny">1766</a>, Derrick's West Manor property was assessed moderately. However, a year later, the Manor tax rolls identified the property holder of record as "Derrick Brat's widow." 

<p>Dirck A. Bradt filed a <a href="../../wills/willdibradt3084.html">will</a> in December 1763. It named Cornelia as co-executor and as his principal heir during her widowhood. Beyond that, it parceled out their varied holdings to the living children and grandchildren. The will passed probate in June 1767.

<p>Although mostly not named in the community-based record, Cornelia Waldron Bradt is said to have lived until the end of the century. In 1790, Cornelia, the widow of Dirk Bradt, Jr., held pew 57 at the Dutch church. We seek more definitive information on her later widowhood and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.</p>
