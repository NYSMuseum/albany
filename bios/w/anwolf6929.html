<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anthony Wolf</strong></a> probably was born about 1740. He was a native of <a href="../ger.html">Ger</a>many. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Most frequently called "Anthony Wolf," he also was referred to as "Anthony Wolf <a href="../../res/sp.html">Reylen</a>." We are not certain that he is or is not distinct from the Albany father <a href="#jwr">known</a> as "John <a href="../../census1790.html#jowo">W</a>olf [Reylen]."

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his marital status. However, in June 1759, "a little girl [of] the Wolfs" was christened under the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.  

<p>In May 1761, the name of "Anthony Wolf" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA634&lpg=RA12-PA634&dq=%22anthony+woolf%22&source=web&ots=hq0MrgbxF_&sig=7sibr8RsHv3rSzUurCrKg6LWnGQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">appeared</a> on the roll of a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company mustered at Albany and under the command of <a href="../vv/jovvechten2532.html">John Van Vechten</a>. Unlike the detailed descriptions that accompanied most others named, the row for Wolf appears as blank.
 
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, "Anthony Wolf's" house and property were valued modestly on the Albany assessment roll.

<p>In January <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA222&lpg=PA222&dq=%22anthony+ryler%22&source=bl&ots=wxhFfTAhnv&sig=RXLZscus-j3qVimekSCcDoXQud4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ElsZUM7fLaLk0QGUmYHABQ&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22anthony%20ryler%22%&f=false">1771</a>, "Anthony Ryler," successfully petitioned the city to lease the house and lot where "Adam Dornbergh lives" at the rate of &pound8:4 for the year. 

<p>In October <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=%22anthony+wolf%22&source=bl&ots=wxhFfTBgiy&sig=o-J-MiOVAsuMMFXN2FlQume-9iE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Zl4ZUPW1OMP10gGvxIGgCg&ved=0CEQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22anthony%20wolf=false">1773</a>, "Anthony Wolf Reylan" was involved in an Albany bribary case. From the subsequent investigation, the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> learned that he had been born in Germany and came "over" when he was 9 or 10. The council concluded that he had not been <a href="../../nat.html">nat</a>uralized, had accepted a bribe to vote, and that his vote was invalid. However, an individual identified as "Anthony Wolf" <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/browse/bookview.aspx?dbid=49119&iid=FLHG_DeniNaturBritishColonAmerica-0345&rc=1524,329,1609,363;1509,424,1595,459;1323,521,1411,556;1364,709,1449,743;1295,805,1379,838;1181,901,1268,935;1345,949,1433,982;1336,1001,1426,1034;1219,1145,1306,1178;1196,1194,1283,1228;1354,1287,1437,1321;1347,1383,1430,1416;1472,1431,1561,1464;1309,1482,1394,1516;1196,1577,1283,1610;1573,1719,1660,1752;128,1816,228,1849;128,1913,230,1945;254,1913,417,1953;1317,1911,1402,1944;128,2006,228,2039;1351,2004,1441,2037;128,2101,230,2132;1245,2098,1332,2132;129,2151,230,2183;1256,2149,1343,2182;129,2200,230,2232;1255,2198,1338,2231;129,2250,230,2283;1264,2249,1349,2282;129,2346,230,2378;1268,2344,1355,2377;129,2395,229,2427;1234,2394,1319,2427;130,2443,230,2476;1200,2442,1286,2474;129,2538,230,2571;130,2587,230,2620;1207,2587,1295,2619;130,2637,231,2669;1278,2635,1366,2668;132,2687,231,2718&pid=25132&ssrc=&fn=anthony&ln=wolf&st=g">was</a> naturalized in Pennsylvania in 1763. A number of people with the surname "Wolf" were living in Pennsylvania at that time.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6929">1779</a>, his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was valued moderately.

<p>After that, the name of Anthony Wolf has not yet been found in our sweeps of available resources except for a listing in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> as the head of a household in the town of Westchester (Westchester County).</p>
