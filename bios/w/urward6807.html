<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Uriah Ward</strong></a> is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=REG&db=:1035833&id=I2860">said</a> to have been born in December 1745. Thus, he would have been the son of Daniel Ward and his <a href="http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/12233282?n=146&imagesize=1200&jp2Res=0.25&printThumbnails=no">second wife</a>, the widow Mary Stone Coggin, of Worcester, Massachusetts. Uriah was a younger son and grew up in a large combined family. His father was said to have been a "man of prominence and a major of militia." A number of same-named contemporaries complicate assigning qualitative information. This sketch focuses on the Albany resident of <a href="../../census1800.html#6807">1800</a>.

<p>In December 1767, Uriah married Jememia Harrington of Worcester. Their daughter supposedly was christened in Worcester the following July. Their son, future Albany resident <a href="daward6803.html">Daniel Ward</a>, was born there in 1772. At least seven <a href="http://ww.genealogyofnewengland.com/f_1f1.htm#42">children</a> were born to that marriage.

<p>He has been identified as an officer during the Revolution. <a href="../../res/ts.html">However</a>, we seek substantive documentation of his affiliation and service. 

<p>In 1790, the name of Uriah Ward was still on the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=y-87AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=%22uriah+ward%22+1790&source=bl&ots=K5LWxYN02q&sig=91sTDiUbTrUTnMzizFfnzAwjB8E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uviwT76vLKuA6QH9lMnOCQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22uriah%20ward%22%201790&f=false">assessment rolls</a> of Worcester.

<p>Perhaps this <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> re-located to Albany during the 1790s along with his son who appears to have become a more permanent Albany resident.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#6807">1800</a>, only the aging couple and a young girl were enumerated on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> Albany census under Uriah Ward. That listing stands as the only <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based</a> record of his life in Albany.
   
<p>According to family-based resources, this individual had returned to New England where his wife died in March 1807. Uriah Ward died in Medfield, Massachusetts in March 1813. This Revolutionary war veteran and one-time Albany resident had lived almost sixty-eight years.</p>
