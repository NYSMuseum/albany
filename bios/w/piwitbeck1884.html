<strong>Pieter W. Witbeck</strong></a> was born in January 1746. He was the son of Johannes and Eva Waldron Witbeck. He was known as "Pieter Waldron Witbeck" in honor of his maternal <a href="../w/pwaldron668.html">grandfather</a>.  


<p>In January 1768, he married <a href="../vd/ravdb5849.html">Rachel Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1784, five children had been christened in Albany . Rachel died, and in December 1787, he married Marria Pruyn also in Albany. 


<p>In 1766, he joined in <a href="../../solconst.html#1884">signing</a> the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty.

<p>In 1787, he was replaced as lieutenant in an Albany militia company for the east Manor. At one <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=F3AEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA422&lpg=PA422&dq=%22peter+w+witbeck%22&source=web&ots=tRevbKejaU&sig=vx3698gY8wBd_A5QukYkhl_ogkk#PPA421,M1">time</a>, he held a lease on a farm in <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/eastgb.htm">Greenbush</a> from <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer</a>. 
<p>Perhaps, his home with five family members and five slaves was configured on the Watervliet census in <a href="../../census1790.html#1884">1790</a>. He seems to have been the only Pieter Witbeck at risk at that time. We seek more definitive information on his later life and passing.
