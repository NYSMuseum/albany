<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Dorothea Witbeck</strong></a> was baptized on January 1, 1698. She was the seventh of eight children born to Albany area residents Andries Jans and Engeltie Douw Witbeck. 

<p>In February 1728, she was thirty years old when she married a somewhat younger <a href="../vs/nvschaick3978.html">Nicholas Van Schaick</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Three months later, the first of her four children was christened in Albany.

<p>This Van Schaick family made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. However, the marriage would be comparatively short-lived.
   
<p>Dorothea Witbeck Van Schaick was identified as the wife of "Claes Van Schaick" when she was buried in the churchyard in June 1740. She had lived but forty-two years. Her husband did not re-marry before he died in 1750.
