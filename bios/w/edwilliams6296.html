<P><a href="#sources"><b>Edward Williams</b></a> born in 1699. He was a middle child of innkeeper and sheriff <a href="thwilliams.html">Thomas Williams</a> and his first wife, <a href="../g/aggansevoort2102.html">Agnietje Gansevoort</a> Williams.</p>

<p>In 1728, he was appointed constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.</p>

<p>By 1732, he had married Albany native <a href="../h/mahogan4377.html">Maria Hogan</a>. They had several children who lived to maturity. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and witnessed a number of baptisms there.</p>


<p>Following his father and his father-in-law, he probably kept a tavern. The city fathers spent three pounds at his house on the King's birthday as late as 1754! His establishment was included on the inventory of Albany houses made in <a href="../../census1756.html#91">1756</a>.</p> 

<p>Edward Williams died in September 1759 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church.
