<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna White</strong></a> was the wife of Albany area resident <a href="../h/juhogan4374.html">Jurrian Hogan</a>. She probably was born during the 1750s. We seek defining information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>In October 1764, <a href="../../res/guess.html">per</a>haps she was the "Anne Afternoon" [sic] who was left &pound;50 in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FhwXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA404&lpg=PA404&dq=%22joseph+white%22+albany+merchant&source=bl&ots=Jvdg07erY2&sig=NrQBzP-YiM9WfZi8Pi2N21WWB7Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw8N2gzPzKAhVDdz4KHQT8CjoQ6AEIJTAD#v=onepage&q=%22joseph%20white%22%20albany%20merchant&f=false">will</a> filed by her brother Albany merchant Joseph White. If so, her mother would have been Mary Tucker of Wilts County in Great Britain. 


<p>In November 1778, Anna married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "<a href="../h/juhogan4374.html">John Hogen</a>" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By the end of the century, the marriage had produced at least nine children who were christened in Albany churches to Jurrian/George and Anna.

<p>Anna's new husband (often called George) was an officer in the Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> both before and during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. 

<p>By the end of the war, these Hogans had taken up residence on a large farm in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>.  In <a href="../../census1790.html#geho">1790</a>, their household was configured on the census for Watervliet.

<p>George Hogan had passed on by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> when his Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> was the responsibility of his siblings.  
 
<p> At this point, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">still seek</a> defining information on the later life and passing of Anna White Hogan.</p>
