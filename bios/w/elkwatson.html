<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elkanah Watson</strong></a> was born in January 1758. He was the son of Elkanah and Patience Mendon Watson of Plymouth, Massachusetts. In 1773, he was apprenticed to a Providence merchant. After the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he served the Revolutionary cause as a courier for George Washington and others. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/watsoncopley.jpg" align=right width=200 height=250 border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Elkanah Watson by John S. Copley"></a> 

<p>During the war years, he traveled up and down the Atlantic coast on "Patriot" business. In 1779, he was sent to France with dispatches for Benjamin Franklin. Wartime travels in Europe and America provided fuel for his memoirs. While in France, he became a prominent merchant. After the war, he returned to the United States and lived for a time in North Carolina. However, he failed to prosper in the West India trade.

<p> In March 1789, he married <a href="../s/rasmith6830.html">Rachel Smith</a> of Norton, Massachusetts. In March 1790, their twin daughters were christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. [One of them, Emily, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/3774537">died</a> in Detroit in 1817.] 

      <p>About the time of his marriage, he had moved to Albany. In 1790, his household 
        was configured on the third ward <a href="../../census1790.html#6835">census</a>. 
        A year earlier, he advertised in the <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> 
        that he was offering for sale "fish, liquor, cookeryware" at his <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
        Street</a> address. Rather quickly, he was prominent in Albany business, 
        had become a land speculator, promoter of public works, and one of the 
        founders of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>. 
        His passion for internal navigation (canals) was <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/research_collections/research/history/three/bat9.html">shared</a> 
        by important Albany personages including General <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
        Schuyler</a>. 
      <p>During the mid-1790s, he also had a residence north of the city in an emerging suburb known as the "<a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Colonie</A>." Later, in identifying his new neighbors, he would <a href="../../art/mt.html#french">observe</a> in some detail that the area "was the resort for French Emigrants."		 

      <p>By <a href="../../census1800.html#6835">1800</a>, he had relocated his 
        operations to a large new home near the waterfront in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. During this time, he was forming strong (and mostly negative) 
        opinions of the Albany scene that were later articulated in his published 
        memoir. 
      <p> In 1807, Watson <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/biography/elkanah-watson/">left</a> Albany to raise Merino sheep on his farm at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. During those years, he continued to travel and was involved in promoting county agricultural fairs.
<a name=wcw></a> 

<p>In 1816, he again was living in Albany with an address listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> of "474 Washington Avenue." His wife died in 1818. In 1828, he moved again - settling down on the shores of Lake Champlain. There, he authored a number of often-cited works on agricultural and economics topics. His son, Winslow C. Watson, carried on Elkanah's work - most notably with <i><a href="../../art/mt.html">Men and Times</a> of the Revolution, or Memoirs of Elkanah Watson; including 
        Journals of Travels in Europe and America from 1777 to 1842; with his 
        Correspondence with Public Men, and Reminiscences and Incidents of the 
        Revolution</i> (New York and London, 1855). That work memorialized his 
        father's dedication to developing the resources of the new United States. 
<p>Elkanah Watson died in Port Kent, New York in December 1842. He had lived more than seventy-four years. 

<p>Although he actually lived in Albany for only about two decades and never 
        really became a part of the Albany community, according to his son and 
        chief <a href="../../art/mt.html">apologist</a>, Elkanah Watson's dedication 
        to improvement profoundly influenced the city's development in banking, 
        education, and public works. Even without much corroborating evidence, 
        this readily available resource has been cited frequently in subsequent 
        histories of Albany. Thus, many people today believe that Elkanah Watson 
        stood in the front rank of the agents of <a href="../../newcomers.html">change</a> 
        during the late eighteenth-early nineteenth centuries.</p>
