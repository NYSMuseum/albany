Two years later, he joined his Albany neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2701">swearing</a> allegiance to the king of England.

<p>Philip Wendell was a shoemaker who was a sergeant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. He also served as a juror. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2701">1720</a>, he was numbered among Albany's freeholders.
