<strong>Kiliaen Winne</strong></a> was born in January 1704. He was the third son born to <a href="dawinne.html">Daniel</a> and <a href="../vn/divness895.html">Dirckie Van Ness</a> Winne. He grew up in a large family on a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farm. In January 1751, he was named as an heir and co-executor of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA482,M1">will</a> filed by his father.

<p>In February 1714, he married Maria Cool. She died after giving birth to three children - the last in 1726. In June 1730, he married Schenectady native <a href="../f/refonda3839.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1743, the marriage had produced seven children - several of whom became Albany residents.

<p>These Winnes made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Kiliaen was known as a <a href="../../makers.html#wood">ca</a>rpenter <a href="../../census1756.html#53">and</a> a cooper. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1730">1730</a>, he was appointed firemaster. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1744">1744</a> and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1745">1745</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the third ward. On a number of occasions, his account was paid by the city treasurer. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2989">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. During the 1760s, his property was valued moderately on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> rolls.

<p>After that, his name dropped from Albany rolls until perhaps he was the "Killian Winne" whose personal property was taxed under the household of his son in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2989">1788</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2989">1790</a>, "Killian D. Winne's" household was configured at the end of the census for the second ward. He would have been in his mid-eighties at that time!
