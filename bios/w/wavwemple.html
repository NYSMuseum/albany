<P>The name <a href="#sources"><strong>Walter V. Wemple</strong></a> appeared on the roster of an Albany militia company in <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#wavw">May 1767</a>. He was listed among the "enlisted men" composed almost exclusively of Albany city residents. This sketch focuses on the individual (hopefully) uniquely known as "Walter V. Wemple." He sometimes was referred to as "Vr<a href="../../res/sp.html">o</a>man."

      <p>Extensive and impressive family-based <a href="http://www.wemple.org/getperson.php?personID=I542&tree=Wemple">research 
        has established</a> him as the eldest son of Albany-area residents Abraham 
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cZUyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA237&lpg=PA237&dq=claverack+walter+wemple&source=bl&ots=pPFAkn4Su8&sig=_DN6RtzwLNyBGjimnx--WWnIaUU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCsQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjO1OqM24PJAhUJdj4KHZl8CIw#v=onepage&q=claverack%20walter%20wemple&f=false">and</a> 
        Rachel Vrooman Wemple and that he was born prior to early 1751. He later 
        would settle in Claverack and married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> 
        Mary Hogeboom there in May 1785. Perhaps the marriage produced but two 
        children - neither of whom survived to raise families of their own. He 
        is <a href="http://www.wemple.org/getperson.php?personID=I542&tree=Wemple">said</a> 
        to have died and was buried in the Claverack cemetery with the following 
        inscription "Dr. Walter Vrooman Wemple, died Aug 10, 1789 in the 47th 
        year of his age." 
      <p>In November 1772, Walter V. was listed among the partners <a href="https://archive.org/stream/calendarofnycolo00alba#page/576/mode/1up">seeking </a> 8,000 acres in Albany County located east of the Hudson and north of <a href="../../na/kayad.html">Kay</a>derossaras. That petition appears to have been <a href="https://archive.org/stream/calendarofnycolo00alba#page/583/mode/1up">granted</a>.

<p>In October 1773, Walter V. Wemple was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hXUtAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA104&lpg=RA1-PA104&dq=walter+v+wemple&source=bl&ots=FMoBUXiBHe&sig=Mqc5SLnCkUpO8d_6hLm1rhLvI3c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBmoVChMIkcnzzdH-yAIVxxc-Ch0GQQYv#v=onepage&q=walter%20v%20wemple&f=false">listed</a> as secretary at a <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> Lodge meeting in Albany. The name would appear several additional times in the printed minutes.

<p>In March 1776, Dr. Samuel Stringer <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=53KyAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=walter+v+wemple&source=bl&ots=Y6pG8A6LNx&sig=00oPCYNqCV4ByKL6f5mJ1c4oA8E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CD8Q6AEwB2oVChMIkcnzzdH-yAIVxxc-Ch0GQQYv#v=onepage&q=walter%20v%20wemple&f=false">hailed him</a> as "Dear Vroman" in a letter addressed to WVW "Surgeon in the general hospital, Canada."

<p>In June 1777, he was in Albany where he was among those <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=g4Q-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=%22walter+v+wemple%22&source=bl&ots=F940TzLHZb&sig=DQe3UKvWxpfX0vG-GoUCIn6F8SQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgKahUKEwiNvPDVoIHJAhWKGz4KHWMcBZw#v=onepage&q=%22walter%20v%20wemple%22&f=false">signing</a> a clemency petition for a condemned resident of Livingston Manor. 

<p>From 1786 to 1797, Walter V. Wemple was the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=aX5QAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=walter+v+wemple&source=bl&ots=ri7z6PTNm1&sig=aOgtkeIr9WZZTj4lHcxnISeFUos&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMIkcnzzdH-yAIVxxc-Ch0GQQYv#v=onepage&q=walter%20v%20wemple&f=false">clerk</a> of Columbia County.

<p>In <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHKP-FFW">1790</a>, the census for Claverack configured the household of Walter V. Wemple with an adult male, a female, and five slaves.

<p>A pension <a href="https://www.fold3.com/document/28462870/">application</a> for Continental <a href="http://www.wemple.org/getperson.php?personID=I542&tree=Wemple">service</a> was submitted by his heirs and detailed his wartime activities.

 
<p>A recent monograph on the political climate of the postwar Hudson Valley <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=L0XxrMd4nEsC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22walter+v+wemple%22&source=bl&ots=cNmuc3_K1f&sig=pRdsr22efl7DMUHaC4e91d6r-1E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgKahUKEwiNvPDVoIHJAhWKGz4KHWMcBZw#v=onepage&q=%22walter%20v%20wemple%22&f=true">noted</a> 
        that "Dr. Walter V. Wemple (settled in the village [Claverack] since the 
        late 1770s but with many connections in Albany where he had once been 
        a member of the secret Lodge of Perfection) served as county treasurer 
        until his death in 1798.</p>

Wemple has no CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. The Wemple family mostly did not inhabit the city of Albany during the pre-Revolutionary war era. Wemples were much more numerous in the surrounding hinterland.
<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; At this point we are <a href="../qqqq.html">not certain</a> why Walter V. Wemple belonged to a city-based militia company or what qualified him to become "senior surgeon" in the Revolutionary army. Perhaps, his <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> connection (<a href="../s/sastringer5046.html">Dr. Stringer</a> was a central figure in both initiatives) opened doors for him.</div>
