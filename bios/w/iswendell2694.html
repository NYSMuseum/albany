<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Isaac Wendell</strong></a> was born in November 1688. He was the son of Albany leaders <a href="jowendell2942.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats</a> Wendell. He was the twin of <a href="sawendell.html">Sara Wendell Glen</a>. Their father died early in 1692 - leaving a large family. Their mother re-married in 1697 and bore several more children. Within a few years, his <a href="../s/joschuyler100.html">stepfather</a> was appointed mayor of Albany.

<p>In 1691, he was <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">named</a> among the many heirs to her father's substantial estate.

<p>In November 1717, Isaac married physician's daughter <a href="../vd/cavdyck619.html">Catharina Van Dyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> By 1739, their ten children had been christened in Albany.  

<p>For the first twenty-five years of the marriage, Isaac Wendell's name was otherwise missing from the mainline Albany community record. But, in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, he was identified as a qualified voter who lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a>.

<p><a href="#2">Perhaps</a> Isaac Wendell died within a decade.
