<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"><b>Dudley Walsh</b></a> was born about 1761. He is said to have been a native of Dublin, <a href="../irish.html">Ireland</a>. He probably came to Albany during the 1780s.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6798">1790</a>, he was living in an Albany house on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market Street</a>. At that time, a boy under sixteen lived with him. Following his marriage to  <a href="../s/sarstevenson.html">Sarah Stevenson</a> in September 1793, the <a href="../../census1800.html#6798">household grew</a> to include children and servants. That property was assessed substantially on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1788tl">tax rolls</a>. His marriage to the daughter of a prominent <a href="../s/jostevenson2244.html">merchant</a> helped ease his entry into elite business circles.</p>

<p>He was known as a merchant who was involved with a number of partners. He traded with other merchants in Cazenovia and elsewhere in New York State. He owned a branch store in Geneva, New York. Albany native Abraham Dox worked for him there and then purchased the store about 1804. He also supplied chemical reagents to Dupont munitions in Delaware. In 1801, he held a grocer's license.</p>  

<p>After making a number of adjustments to his holdings on Market Street, he purchased lots and a row of houses on lower <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius Street</a>. Those properties extended west along the "Turnpike" and were sold off during the last years of his life. In January 1800, he <a href="http://www.dcnyhistory.org/deedsbookA.html">purchased</a> eight, 50-100-acre tracts in the town of Schoharie. He owned properties elsewhere in upstate New York and also traded in <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty rights</a>.</p>

<p>Although he appears to not have held any municipal positions or to be connected to any of Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>, he was a prominent member of the boards of a number of Albany enterprises and organizations including the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Albany Bank</a> and Union College.

<p>The first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22walsh+dudley%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22walsh%20dudley%22&f=false">1813</a> showed the home and business of "Dudley Walsh & Co., merchant" at 77 and 78 Market Street 

<p>Dudley Walsh died on May 24, 1816 at the age of fifty-five. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> at the end of August.</p>
