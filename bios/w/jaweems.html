<P>Spelled <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, Captain <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Weems</strong></a> commanded a <a href="../../garrison.html">company</a> of soldiers serving at the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> in Albany during the 1690s and early 1700s. However, several same-named individuals were in North America at that time.

<p>He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been a soldier who came from Scotland to America about 1695. However, several <a href="../../res/irs.html">references</a> place him in North America during the late 1680s. These appear to be incorrect - perhaps due to a flawed transcription of the date! 

<p>In June 1695, the Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pZwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=%22capt.+weems%22+1695&source=bl&ots=1KhElqxzQY&sig=PPJxgeOOdTJiECefMWYF4ei1cG0&hl=en&ei=t-HBS_KrDsSclgel_fzcBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22capt.%20weems%22%201695&f=false">city records</a> first referenced him as "capt of fusilleers" and contracted with <a href="../s/rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a> to provide him with lodging. In August 1696, he already was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=z0QVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=%22james+weems%22+albany&source=bl&ots=cY1woc8KQt&sig=TdYi69BmFiGhgEvjzanc48xJKk4&hl=en&ei=Sj7DS9bHBoH58Aa08enUCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CA0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22james%20weems%22%20albany&f=false">involved</a> with the provincial government and the Albany <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners</a> in frontier defense and diplomatic relations with the Indians.

 Muster rolls and information on his fusiliers stationed at Albany from the 1690s has <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PP1118&lpg=RA12-PA1118&dq=%22weems+james+captain%22&sig=7sibr8RsHv3rSzUurCrKg6LWnGQ&id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&ots=hq0MrgbxF_#v=onepage&q=%22weems%20james%20captain%22&f=false">survived</a>.
<p>Until 1704, he was known as a "captain of fusilleers" and had regular business with the city government regarding his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&pg=RA1-PA37&lpg=RA1-PA37&dq=%22james+weems%22+albany&source=bl&ots=_rObLSwxyf&sig=cywDT4uhndoO-toGLnCCPSypNVA&hl=en&ei=CTbDS-D0KISKlwec1v3cBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CBsQ6AEwCA#">command</a> at Albany. In 1703, he arranged for the burial of a number of his soldiers through the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1704 and 1706, four of his soldiers married local women at the Albany church. A number of the soldiers in his command married into the Albany community.
 
<p>In August 1699, he commanded the garrison soldiers who took part in an <a href="http://www.americanindian.net/August.html">attack</a> on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fa0TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=%22james+weems%22+albany&source=bl&ots=jaB7Q9Hehc&sig=Gsn-p9W3XY881uzujtpZ5655_4I&hl=en&ei=tj_DS_zAGoOC8gbUq6HlCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22james%20weems%22%20albany&f=true">Pemmiquid</a>, [Maine]. Francis Parkman <a href="http://www.fullbooks.com/Count-Frontenac-and-New-France-under-Louis4.html">tells</a> us that Weems and others were taken prisoner by the <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&rlz=1R2ADRA_enUS360&q=abenaki+weems&aq=f&aqi=g10&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=&fp=467c3568f2eec009">Abenakis</a> following his surrender. 

<p>In 1702, he was referenced in a <a href="../../wills/willedreims.html">will</a> filed by an Albany victualler.

<p>Although stationed at Albany, during the early 1700s, he <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/12.html">reported</a> on conditions at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. In 1703, Governor Cornbury reported that Weems had 92 men under his command.

 
<p>He is <a href="http://weems-genealogy.blogspot.com/2010/01/found-will-of-captian-james-weems.html">thought</a> to have filed a will in New York in 1723. James Weems is <a href="http://weems-genealogy.blogspot.com/search?q=albany">said</a> to have died in New York in 1723.</p>

<div class="smalltext"> <A href="../../criteria.html"> <IMG align=left alt="the people of colonial Albany" border=1 width=30 height=30 hspace=4   src="../../images/jpg/logoicon.jpg" vspace=4></A> <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of James Weems has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. Substantial resources appear to be <a href="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=70878">available</a> for a more comprehensive appreciation of his command. This sketch will attempt to focus on his Albany context!

 
<p><dd>Curiously, this particular sketch provides a documentable case study of some of the activities of the Albany garrison for the years around 1700. This career officer is especially important to the early Albany story because so many of his <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> soldiers <a href="../../marriages.html#daughters">married</a> local girls and founded mainline Albany families.
