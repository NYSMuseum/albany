<strong>Benjamin Winne</strong></a> was born in December 1705. He was the son of Rensselaerswyck farmer <a href="liwinne2995.html">Livinius Winne</a> and his second wife, Willemptie Viele (widow Schermerhorn)  Winne. His father died in 1706 and his mother (daughter of interpreter <a href="../v/acviele6777.html">Aernout C. Viele</a>) re-married (to Johannes Van Hoesen) three years later.


<p>In December 1728, Benjamin married <a href="../va/ravarn.html">Rachel Van Arnhem</a>.  By 1747, nine children had been christened at the Albany 
<a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor. Four of their daughters married Albany residents.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#bw">1742</a>, he was counted among the freeholders living in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.

<p>In July 1755, the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> directed the treasurer to allow him six skipples of wheat and to charge his account.

<p>In 1766 and '67, his west side Rensselaerswyck property was valued on  the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#bw">1790</a>, "<a href="#his">his</a>" household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. 

<p>Benjamin Winne is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rclarke/page3/viele_a.htm">said</a> to have died in January 1797.</p>

The life of Benjamin <a href="winne.html">Winne</a> has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.  Although <a href="../../criteria.html">not technically</a> a city person, he had business with/in Albany and several of his children became Albany residents. 

<p><a name=his></a>Benjamin Winne had no son named Benjamin. Even though he would have been in his eighties, the census entry may have been to this individual.</p>
