<strong>Jacobus Luycasse</strong></a> was probably was born during the 1670s. He was the son of <a href="luwyn6218.html">Luykas Gerritse</a> and <a href="../vh/anvh748.html">Anna Van Hoesen</a>. Later, his family would be known as Wyngaert.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6213">1699</a>, he joined his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1699lo">After</a> that, he signed a number of other community-based documents. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6213">1709</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> house was assessed modestly. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6213">1720</a>, he was identified as a freeholder living in the third ward.

<p>In 1716, he contracted with the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> to "set up stockadoes."

<p>In November 1700, he married <a href="../q/maq2204.html">Maria Quackenbush</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1721, nine children had been christened in Albany.


<p>Jacobus Luycasse Wyngaert died in September 1727 and was buried in the churchyard. Several of his children became Albany residents. His widow may have survived into the 1750s.</p>
