<strong>Ephraim Wendell</strong></a> was born in February 1689. He was the son of <a href="evwendell2656.html">Evert</a> and <a href="../s/elsanders1416.html">Elizabeth Sanders</a> Wendell. A year later, he was named in his father's <a href="../../wills/willevwendelljr.html">will</a>.

<p>In September 1713, he married <a href="../vn/anvness867.html">Anna Van Ness</a>. By 1731, nine children had been christened at that Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, between 1727 and 1734, he <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/chbur_wz.html">buried</a> five of those children.

<p>He seems to have followed his family into the Indian <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a> although his Albany enterprises occasioned little recognition. He lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>, was <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">qualified</a> to <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2868">vote</a>, and, in <a href="../../census1756.html#131">1756</a>, also was known as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his second ward holdings were assessed comparable to those of other successful merchants. As a younger man in 1715, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>Ephraim lost his wife in 1758. In August 1765, he was among the Albany elders called to testify in a <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html#will">disputed probate case</a>. At that time, he was thought to have been about seventy-seven years old. According to a family bible, Ephraim Wendell "rested in the Lord" when he died in October 1769. He had lived for more than eighty-one years.</p>
