      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Wendell</strong></a> was born in 
        September 1745. He was the son of <a href="hawendell2669.html">Harmanus</a> 
        and <a href="../vv/cavvechten2398.html">Catharina Van Vechten</a> Wendell. 
        He grew up in a merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
        Street</a>. In 1769, he was named heir and co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willhawendell2669.html">estate</a> 
        of his father. 
      <p>In January 1768, he married Albany native <a href="../l/anlansing3161.html">Anna 
        Lansing</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1785, 
        six children had been christened at his Albany church. 
      <p>In 1766, he joined with other Albany men in <a href="../../solconst.html#2766">signing</a> 
        the constitution of the Sons of Liberty. By the 1770s, he had begun to 
        take his place as a contractor in city-based activities. In 1775, he was 
        named ensign of the third ward watch. In August 1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2766">identified</a> 
        as an Assistant Deputy QMG and was on duty at <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. 
        Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2766">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>This Wendell family made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a> where he operated a store with his brother <a href="johwendell2975.html">John</a>. 
        In November 1784, the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">paper</a> advertized 
        that the Wendells were "selling imported goods from London, opposite the 
        post office near the <a href="../../loc/markethouse.html">Market house</a>." 
        Perhaps Cornelis engaged in the river carrying trade as well. In April 
        1793, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willabwendell2740.html">will</a> 
        of his brother. 
      <p>During the 1770s, <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2766">80s</a>, 
        and 90s, his third ward home and property elsewhere were valued on city 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">assessment rolls</a>. In 1788, 
        he joined in <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#2766">signing</a> a community-based 
        document objecting to the proposed Federal constitution. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2766">1790</a>, 
        his household was configured on the census. But, by 1800, he seems to 
        have moved in with one of his brothers - although he retained his lots 
        and dock rights. 
      <p>Cornelis Wendell died in January 1814. He had lived sixty-eight years.</p>
