          <P><A href="#biography"><B>William Waldron</B></A> was born in 1700. 
            He was the son of Manhattan mason <a href="pwaldron668.html">Pieter 
            Waldron</a>, and his wife, <a href="../vd/cavdb5740.html">Catharina 
            Vandenbergh</a>. Shorly after his birth, these Waldrons relocated 
            to Albany.</P>

          <P>William grew up in Albany learning the mason's trade from his father. In January 
            1720, he married <a href="../b/elbeekman3907.html">Elizabeth Beekman</a> 
            at the Albany Dutch church. Their first child was born six months 
            later. Ten more births were recorded in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> baptism records between 1721 and 1741.</p>

<p>Setting up his home in the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a>, for more than three decades he was a <a href="../../census1756.html#171">prominent</a> Albany artisan. Several times, he performed masonry work for the city <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>. He served  as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in 1722 and 1728 and was elected assistant alderman for the first ward in 1738 and 1739.  Like his father, he probably engaged in business - thus accounting for his selection as an assistant because that post usually was reserved for merchants.</p> 
<p>During the 1730s, he leased additional land on the <a href="#plain">plain</a> from the city. Three decades later, he still was adding to those holdings.  Over that time, his <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#678">name</a> was found on <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#678">lists</a> of Albany freeholders.   

<p>William Waldron made out his <a href="../../wills/willwmwaldron.html">will</a> in March 1768. He identified himself as an Albany "measoner" [mason]. Just shy of his sixty-eighth birthday, he stated that he was in good health. His wife was dead but William provided for his son Pieter and daughters <a href="cowaldron648.html">Cornelia Clark</a>, Neeltie Vandenbergh, and Anna Waldron. The will passed probate in October 1774.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>name</B> is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 678. This profile is derived chiefly 
            from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.</p>

<p><a name=plain></a><b>The Plain:</b> Probably referring to vacant lots owned by the city above South Pearl Street and/or south of the city stockade. The last of Waldron's transactions transpired in 1769. In 1776, his "Albany real estate" was advertized for sale!</p>
