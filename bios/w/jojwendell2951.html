<P>This individual, one of a number of contemporaries known as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes J. Wendell</strong></a>, was born in June 1719. He was the last son of the marriage of Albany residents <a href="jowendell2943.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../v/suviele.html">Susanna Viele</a> Wendell. Mostly, he was <a href="../../res/sp.html">referred</a> to as John J. [or I.] Wendell to prevent confusion with a number of same-named kin including his father. Johannes J. grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and became more historically distinct with the passing of <a href="jowendell2943.html">Johannes Wendell</a> in 1743. A <a href="jowendell2977.html">son</a>, born in 1751, bore the full name as well. 

<p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1743">1743</a>, he was appointed constable for the first ward and also high constable for the entire <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a>.
  
<p>In September 1750, a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">marr</a>iage license was granted to Johannes J. Wendell and Brooklyn native <a href="../b/sabergen.html">Sara Bergen</a>. They were <a href="https://archive.org/stream/recordsofreforme01coll#page/n393/mode/2up">married</a> in New York City a few days later. However, beginning in June 1751, four children were christened by them in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents also would be occasional baptism sponsors.

<p>By <a href="../../census1756.html#113">1756</a> "Jno Wendall" was identified as an Albany householder and a shoemaker. Despite a number of same-named contemporaries, we move forward 
assigning such qualitative material to this individual.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2951">1763</a>, his name appeared on a countywide list of freeholders. City assessment rolls for the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">mid-1760s</a> valued John Wendell's property on two occasions. Located in the first ward, Wendell's holdings were accorded a moderately modest assessment - comparable to that of other city <a href="../../makers.html">tradesmen</a>. In 1767, he probably was one of the "rank and file" Johannes Wendells listed on the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA802&lpg=RA12-PA800&dq=militia+1767+roseboom&source=web&ots=hq0KulgrC3&sig=KO3WO4tIB1dP9VDxGJLcFoFoa8s#v=onepage&q&f=false">roster</a> of Captain <a href="../r/heroseboom1659.html">Hendrick M. Roseboom</a>'s city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. By that time, perhaps the younger <a href="jowendell2976.html">John A. Wendell</a> was distinguishable from the others.

<p>Into his fifties at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a> found John J. Wendell among the first ward residents contributing supplies for the relief of Ticonderoga. In November 1776, he was paid for carrying marching orders to county militia colonels "to march on the late alarm to the northward." In August 1778, perhaps it was his name that <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2954">appeared</a> on a Quartermaster's Dept. roster as "Overseer of the Public Stables, with Six Hostlers." A year later, he was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YYjPr7Ht7d8C&pg=PA385&lpg=PA385&dq=%22sir,+mr.+john+wendell%22&source=bl&ots=k6GCiZqggF&sig=DuyATxjf2G3YEBEy5f0ypYF9Ces&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjulsr43tvUAhWLOT4KHWwyC0YQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&q=%22sir%2C%20mr.%20john%20wendell%22&f=false">held back</a> from more active service as he still held that position and was needed in Albany.

<p>In any event, after the war  <a href="../qqqq.html#one">a</a> John I. Wendell was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2977">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> regiment. 

<p>After that, our grasp of this subject's later life becomes less solid. Probably, it was his <a href="jowendell2977.html">son</a> who died in 1786.
