<strong>Rachel Winne</strong></a> was born in the 1670s. She was the daughter of <a href="piwinne8568.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../a/adamswinne.html">Tannetje Adams</a> Winne. She was named in the <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne8568.html">will</a> filed by her parents in 1684. In March 1695, she joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.


<p>In December 1695, she married <a href="../f/jefonda3767.html">Jellis Fonda</a> at her church in Albany. By 1722, the marriage had produced eleven children who were christened at the Dutch churches in Albany and Schenectady.

<p>These Fondas set up their <a href="../../census1697.html#124">home</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. By the early 1700s, they had moved to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where Jellis practiced the gunstock maker's trade and lived for the remainder of his life.  


<p>Rachel Winne Fonda also is said to have died in Schenectady. She was alive in 1737 and named in the will filed by her husband.</p>
