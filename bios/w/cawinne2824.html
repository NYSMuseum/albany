<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Catalina Winne</B></A> was born in October 1688. She was the daughter of Albany area farmer and ropemaker Adam Winne and his wife, <a href="../l/anloock5932.html">Anna Loockermans</a> Winne. Her father died while she was a baby. Her mother re-married in October 1690 and gave birth to seven more children.</p>

<p>In July 1706, Catharina was not yet eighteen when she married Albany blacksmith <a href="../y/chyates4407.html">Christoffel Yates</a>. The following spring, the first of their ten children was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> where she was a pewholder. In later years, their home was in 
<a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> while Christoffel's smithy remained in Albany.</p>

<p>Christoffel Yates died in 1754. His widow was listed on a British army inventory of <a href="../../census1756.html#2">Albany households</a> made in 1756. Catalina Winne Yates died a few years later.</p>
