      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John A. Wendell</strong></a> was born in November 
        1749. He was the youngest son of Albany merchant <a href="abwendell2740.html">Abraham 
        H. Wendell</a> and his second wife, <a href="elwendell2674.html">Elizabeth 
        Wendell</a> Wendell. John A. lost his mother in 1757 and seems to have 
        lived with his father, a prominent <a href="../../streets.html#state">State 
        Street</a> merchant. He received a bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2663.html">will</a> 
        filed by his uncle in 1763. 
      <p>In 1767, his name was on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.  After 1775,  he was appointed second lieutenant.  He also received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2976">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with militia during the War for Independence. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1776">1776</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2976">1788</a>, and  <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his modest personal property was valued on assessment rolls under his <a href="../../census1790.html#2740">father's</a> household.

<p>In 1793, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willabwendell2740.html">will</a> of his father who died early in 1800. Later, in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, John A. was listed as the head of a first ward household that included an older woman and one slave.

<p>A man of modest achievements, John A. Wendell died some time after 1800. Unmarried, he left no direct descendants. </p>
