<strong>Geesie</strong></a><strong> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">G</a>isseltie) </strong><a href="#sources"><strong>Wendell</strong></a> was christened on February 1, 1719. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jowendell2945.html">Johannes E.</a> and <a href="../k/ankip5944.html">Anna Kip</a> Wendell. She grew up in a merchant's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> but lost her father in 1739. Her mother, however, survived for many years.  

<p>She probably did not marry. However, in 1757, she appears to have been a pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church.</a>

<p>Geesie lived in Albany with her widowed mother and/or her <a href="evwendell2663.html">brother</a>.

<p>In 1763, she was mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2663.html">will</a> of her brother. After her mother's death, she was named to inherit a share of his estate. In 1774, she was named co-executor of her mother's estate. Her mother died in September 1779. Geesie probably was included in the household of "Anna Wendell" as it appeared on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">assessment rolls</a> earlier in that year.




      <p>Then in her sixties, Geesie Wendell filed her own <a href="../../wills/willgeewendell2872.html">will</a> 
        in March 1783. It identified her as a "single woman" of Albany city. It 
        noted her pasture land in the first ward, a farm in Tryon County, land 
        in the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga Patent</a>, and 
        personal property. It named her <a href="cawendell2775.html">sister</a> 
        and nieces and nephews as beneficiaries. Her will passed probate in August 
        of that year. </p>
