<strong>Catharina Wendell</strong></a> was born in July 1735. She was the daughter of <a href="../w/jawendell2697.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../vr/helvr5081.html">Helena Van Rensselaer</a> Wendell. Her father was an Albany merchant whose rise was cut off by his death in 1745. Her mother was the daughter of the most prominent family in the region. She lived until 1792 and was able to raise her large family under the Van Rensselaer family umbrella. 

<p>In April 1762, Catharina married <a href="../c/abhcuyler363.html">Abraham H. Cuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1773, the marriage had produced five children who were christened in the Albany church where she was a pewholder and baptism sponsor.

<p>These Cuylers lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> where Abraham H. Cuyler was a businessman, militia officer, and community stalwart.

<p>We seek information on the rest of her life. Catharina Wendell Cuyler gave up her church pew in 1790 but may have survived to the end of the century.</p>
