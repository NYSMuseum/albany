<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hester Wendell</b></a> was born in September 1686. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jewendell2940.html">Jeronimus</a> and <a href="../v/arvisscher4100.html">Ariaantie Visscher</a> Wendell. Losing her father before she was ten, Hester was raised by her mother in their <a href="../../streets.html#state">State</a> Street <a href="../../census1697.html#004">home</a>.</p>


<p>In January 1714, she was twenty-seven-years-old when she married Albany trader-turned-businessman <a href="../b/jobeekman3859.html">Johannes Beekman, Jr.</a> By 1722, the marriage had produced three children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were regular baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Beekmans lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in a comfortable home attended by servants. Johannes Beekman, Jr. died in 1741. His <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3859.html">will</a> left the entire estate to Hester as long as she remained a widow. The will passed probate in 1743. Hester Wendell Beekman died sometime thereafter!</p>
