            <P><A href="#biography"><B>John W. Wendell</B></A> was a <a href="../../trades/hatter.html">hatmaker</a> 
              who came to Albany in the decade prior to the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War 
              for Independence</a>.</p>
            <p><a href="#image"><img src="../../images/jpg/ejwwcourt.jpg" align=right width=150 border=1 alt="John W. Wendell in his Court Street home" vspace=4 hspace=4></a>He 
              was born about 1740 and was said to be a native of Boston. He also 
              was called John Walter Wendell. In 1771, he married Albany native 
              <a href="../t/matrotter4913.html">Mary Trotter</a> and began to 
              raise a family. The Trotters belonged to <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
              Peters</a> and at least two of his children were baptized in the 
              Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Later, he would 
              become a member and long-time trustee of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian 
              Church</a>. He also was an officer of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic 
              Lodge</a>.</P>
            <P>Settling near his in-laws, in 1772 he received title to a lot along 
              <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> and began to 
              make hats. In 1774, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
              for the first ward. His career was pre-empted by the outbreak of 
              war. In 1775, he was appointed Quartermaster for the Second New 
              York Regiment of the Continental army. In August 1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2954">identified</a> 
              as an Assistant "Commissary of Forage" under the overall command of <a href="../l/morlewis.html">Morgan Lewis</a> in Albany. In 1779, he was keeping the Continental 
              stables in Albany. He also contributed financially to the American 
              cause and later received a number of <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land 
              bounty rights</a>.</P>
            <p>With the end of the war, now middle-aged John W. Wendell began 
              to advertize his "manufactured" beaver, "castor," and felt hats 
              for sale in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. 
              His store a few doors south of city hall also sold drygoods. Expanding 
              his holdings with adjoining lots, he opened a hat factory in partnership 
              with William Trotter - his brother-in-law. Wendell's factory was 
              a Court Street landmark and an outstanding local example of the 
              emergence of American manufacturing. He later leased a water lot 
              near the city "watering place." This "hat manufacturer" was one 
              of the founding members and first president of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany 
              Mechanics Society</a>.</p>
            <p>In 1784, Wendell was elected to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city 
              council</a> as assistant alderman for the first ward. Active in 
              committee work, he was re-elected several times. In 1788, he was 
              among the Albany notables who signed a <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#2954">printed 
              document</a> voicing opposition to adoption of what became the United 
              States Constitution.</p>
            <p>During the 1790s, he operated a hotel/tavern/boarding house on 
              his Court Street <a href="../../census1800.html#2954">complex</a>. 
              John W. Wendell died in February 1802. He lived to the age of sixty-two.</p>

              <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>John W. Wendell</B> is CAP 
              <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 2954. This profile is derived 
              chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. 
              He is not identifiable from the Wendell family resources we have 
              examined. His son, Oliver, born in 1785, signals a possible connection 
              to the Massachusetts Oliver family whose daughter married Albany 
              native-turned-Boston-merchant Jacob Wendell in 1714. <a href="../../inprog.html">Stay
