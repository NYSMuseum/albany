<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Joseph Wells</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">sometimes</a> Josiah and Welles) may have been <a href="../../drc.html">christened</a> in Albany in February 1727. If so, he was the son of James and Elizabeth <a href="../../res/sp.html">Wells</a>.

<p>October 1750, he married Maria Daniels at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. They were married with a certificate from Albany. In May 1757, their son James was christened by <a href="../o/jogilvie.html">Rev. Ogilvie</a> in Albany. In 1753, the couple witnessed the baptism of his brother's son in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#162">1756</a>, his name (Josiah Wells) appeared on a list of Albany householders taken by the British army.

<p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1757">1757</a>, he was named constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. However, the following March he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=%22joseph+wells%22+albany&source=bl&ots=wwkD8Xuekw&sig=rUy1o9zRf6fy3ojF5Po2S4FlaBs&hl=en&ei=to7ES7XMJMT68AabrdGzDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CA8Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22joseph%20wells%22%20albany&f=false">removed</a> as constable as he had "entered the battoe service."

<p>His name seems to be absent from the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based record</a> for the years following the French <a href="../../7yw.html">and</a> Indian War. Perhaps he was the same-named <a href="../../sources.html#uny">individual</a> who was a property holder and militiaman in Coxsackie in 1766.

<p>Following the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, a "Joseph Wellsh" was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6856">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information of the remainder of the life of the Albany Joseph Wells and his family.</p>
