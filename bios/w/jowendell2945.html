<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes E. Wendell</strong></a> was born in December 1690. He was the son of <a href="evwendell2656.html">Evert Jr.</a>  and <a href="../s/elsanders1416.html">Elizabeth Sanders</a>  Wendell. He grew up a member of a large family in a prominent businessman's home. He was not named in the <a href="../../wills/willevwendelljr.html">will</a> filed by his father just days before his birth. Evert Wendell, Jr. finally died in 1702 and his mother <a href="../v/frhvisscher4069.html">re-married</a>. He was known as "Johannes E. Wendell" or "Johannes Junior"  to prevent confusion with other same-named kin.

<p>In 1715, he may have been the "Johannis Wendell" identifed as a soldier in a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> troop of horse.
<p>In November 1716, he married Albany native <a href="../k/ankip5944.html">Anna Kip</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1736, eight children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Wendells made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Johannes was a merchant, city official, and contractor. In <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#2945">1715</a>, he was a member of John Schuyler's troop of horse.

<p> In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1723">1723</a>, he was elected assistant alderman. From <a href="../../org/cc.html#1732">1732-36</a>, he served as alderman. During that time, he was active in <a href="../../corporation.html">city-based</a> projects. He also was a noted member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Indian  Commissioners</a> and was called an interpreter.

<p>In November 1737, he was among those who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> of a neighbor.

<p>Johannes E. Wendell died in December 1739 and was buried from his church. He was just shy of his forty-ninth birthday. His widow survived for a number of years.</p>
