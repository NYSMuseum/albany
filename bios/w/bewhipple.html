<P> According to family-based <a href="http://genweb.whipple.org/d0493/I8174.html">res</a>ources, Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Benjamin Whipple</strong></a> was born in November 1754. Thus, he was the son of David and Martha Reed Whipple of Providence, Rhode Island. The first American Whipple came to Massachusetts during the 1630s. As with many transplanted <a href="../../yankinv.html">N</a>ew Englanders, we have been able to uncover considerable information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. He is almost the exact contempory of a <a href="http://www.greenmountainrangers.com/BioWhipple.html">different</a> same-named Massachusetts Revolutionary soldier.

<p>Reaching adulthood at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, he is <a href="http://www.bucklindata.net/b70.htm">said</a> to have served as a seaman or marine on the ship <i>Providence</i> commanded by one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Whipple">Abraham Whipple</a>. In February 1780, his ship was destroyed in Chrleston harbor and he was captured. He suffered while imprisoned on the notorious prison ship <i>Jersey</i>. As a result, he sustained permanently debilitating injuries. His wartime service became a part of his legend. In 1813, he was among the several hundred area residents who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Qy0-NE5lXOUC&pg=PA406&lpg=PA406&dq=%22benjamin+whipple%22+navy&source=bl&ots=G8idZ9njYv&sig=RIeFfPYVg_r60J5iyfLBgZbViXE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PsV2UMekKIKc9QTbyIHoBA&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22benjamin%20whipple%22%20navy&f=false">subscribed</a> for a new book entitled <i>Remarkable Shipwrecks</i>.

<p>In January 1783, he married Susanna Hall in Wrentham, Massachusetts. Perhaps, the marriage produced ten children. By the late 1780s, this budding Whipple family had settled in Albany. 


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6872">1788</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings were assessed moderately. The first Federal census of <a href="../../census1790.html#6872">1790</a> showed that his second ward household included nine family members. A decade later in <a href="../../census1800.html#6872">1800</a>, eight people were counted at what <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22whipple+benjamin%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22whipple%20benjamin%22&f=false">became</a> his permanent address of 61 <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a>. Other <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">com</a>munity-based documents revealed that his address was the same as the <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masters Lodge</a>.

<p>From the 1790s on, this mainline newcomer was known as a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a>. By 1801, he also held the appointment as doorkeeper of the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>. He retained that post for the rest of his life. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that he was given that position because he had been crippled during the war. 

<p>Benjamin Whipple died at the end of April in 1819. The newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22benjamin+whipple%22+albany&source=bl&ots=xs2Gchs2_0&sig=VS8ZiUn_zi0Eey6QZWsKcrbCU_o&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2VF0UOCSEOaK0QH4_YDwDw&ved=0CBwQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22benjamin%20whipple%22%20albany&f=false">obituary</a> briefly noted he was sixty-four and was, for many years, doorkeeper of the State Assemby. Afterwards, his widow removed to her son's home in northern New York and died in Adams, Jefferson County, in 1840. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Benjamin_Whipple">grandson</a> became a notable cleric, missionary, and author.</p>
