<P><a href="#sources"><b>Sara Wendell</b></a> was born in November 1688. She was the daughter of <a href="jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a> and his second wife, <a href="../s/elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats</a> Wendell. Her twin brother was Isaac Wendell. Their father died when Sara was three and her mother re-married - ultimately raising a large <a href="../../census1697.html">combined family</a> in a landmark Albany <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">house</a> and on family farms in the Albany hinterland.

<p>In 1691, she was <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">named</a> among the many heirs to her father's substantial estate. 

<p>In December 1717, Sara married Jacob Glen of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. She then took up residence in the <a href="../g/glen.html">Glen family</a> home across the Mohawk in Scotia. Their only child was born in 1721.</p>

<p>These Glens were north Mohawk leaders as Jacob was a trader, landholder, official, and militia officer. Sara was his partner over a long career that spanned four decades.</p> 

 
<p>Colonel Jacob Glen died at Scotia on August 15, 1762. Sara Wendell Glen died three days after - also from a fever thought to have been contracted from some emigrants who had stayed at their Scotia home. She had lived seventy-three years.</p>
