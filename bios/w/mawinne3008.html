<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Winne</b></a> was born about 1680. She was the daughter of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents Adam and Anna Lookermans Winne.</p>


<p>In July 1701, she married Albany resident <a href="../vd/covdb5644.html">Cornelis Willemse Vandenbergh</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced several children before Vandenbergh's death about 1707. By 1713, she had married widower <a href="../g/jagerr6008.html">Jan Gerritse</a>. By 1722, three more children had been christened at the Albany church where she was a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Gerritse died in 1725 <a href="../../wills/willcowvdb.html">leaving</a> his wife "Maryke" to share in his substantial estate in the   <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> and elsewhere. She maintained control of the household and other property over the next two decades!</p>

<p>Near her eightieth birthday,  in September 1745 Maria filed her <a href="../../wills/willmawinne3008.html">will</a>. It divided the still extensive real and personal estate among her surviving adult children. Maria Winne Vandenbergh Gerritsen had died by June 2, 1748 when her will passed probate.</p>
