          <P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/phwendell.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="young Philip Wendell" width=200></a> 
            <A  href="#biography"><B>Philip Wendell</B></A> was born in 1734. 
            He was the twelfth child and youngest son of Albany attorney <a href="evwendell2657.html">Evert 
            Wendell</a> and his wife <a href="../l/englansing3243.html">Engeltie 
            Lansing</a> Wendell. Losing his father when Philip was sixteen, the 
            boy would be well provided for in Evert Wendell's <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2657.html">will</a>.</P>

          
      <p>For many years, it appeared that Philip might live his life as a bachelor 
        like his much older brother and mentor <a href="abewendell2739.html">Abraham 
        E. Wendell.</a> These men lived together following the death of their 
        mother in 1769 in a substantial first ward home - managing and improving 
        the mills and other assets from the estate of their enormously successful 
        father.</p>

          <p>Philip Wendell's inheritance included a <a href="#mills">budding 
            milling complex</a> in the center of a large tract of bottomland along 
            <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaver Creek</a> and some acreage 
            on a family farm on the Normanskill. For a time, he also held land 
            on the north side of the city along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
            Creek</a>.</p>

<p>He was a well-known if not particularly distinguished member of the Albany community during the third quarter of the eighteenth century. Pewholder at the Albany Dutch church, during the War for Independence he often served as an express rider or courier for the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany committee</a>. He also seems to have been involved in procuring supplies on behalf of the Revolutionary cause.</p>

<p>Like his brother, Philip was quietly successful in managing extensive properties and a number of slaves as well.  By the late 1770s, he was building a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2702">new house</a> on upper State Street on a knoll that would have presided over his Albany pastureland and mills.</p>

          <p>By 1790, his brother had died and Philip Wendell was <a href="../../census1790.html#2702">alone 
            with five slaves</a> in his Albany house. Five years later, at age 
            sixty-one he married young <a href="../p/sapackard.html">Sarah Packard</a>. 
            They had six children born between 1796 and 1803. At that time, his 
            occupation was given as a "gentleman." The census in <a href="../../census1800.html#2702">1800</a> described his first ward household with two older adults, four young children, another women, and four slaves.</p>

<p>Philip Wendell wrote his will in November 1808. It left the bulk of his estate to Sarah as long as she remained a widow. He died a month later at age seventy-five. He was buried in the Dutch church plot at the <a href="#plot">new city cemetery</a>.  His younger widow survived until 1830.
