      <P>This <a href="#sources"><strong>Abraham Wendell</strong></a> was born 
        about 1670. He was the son of <a nref="../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> 
        pioneer <a href="evwendell2655.html">Evert Janse</a> and his second wife, 
        the widow Maria Mingael Wendell. He grew up in a large and prominent combined 
        family with multiple residences in Albany and its hinterland. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#095">1697</a>, he emerged in Albany 
        annals when he was counted alone in a house next to his father in the 
        center of the city. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">1709</a>, 
        his first ward house was accorded a substantial assessment. However, for 
        the most part, his name is conspicuously missing from Albany rolls. 
      <p>In April 1698, he married <a href="../vn/mavness992.html">Maycke Van 
        Ness</a>. By 1716, the marriage had produced nine children who were christened 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>In 1702, he appears to have sold his share in the <a href="../../na/sarapat.html">Saratoga Patent</a> to <a href="../s/joschuyler100.html">Johannes Schuyler</a>.

<p>Abraham Wendell died in January 1755 and was buried from the Albany church.
