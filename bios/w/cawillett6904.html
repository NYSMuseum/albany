<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catherine Willett</strong></a> was born in June 1780. She was the daughter of <a href="edwillett6905.html">Edward S.</a> and <a href="../f/safryer8139.html">Sara Fryer</a> Willett. She was a middle child of the marriage of a transplanted Long Island skipper and the daughter of an Albany-born slooper. She grew up on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">south side</a> of Albany among many English speakers.

<p>As her parents were of British ancestry, she was confirmed at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church in September 1791.

<p>Sometime after 1804, she became the second wife of <a href="../v/jovisscher4153.html">John B. Visscher</a>, perhaps a childless widower. Between, 1810 and 1825, Caty <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=%22john+b+visscher%22&source=bl&ots=aMHHNpMfsK&sig=fD7DPccpxbTyTZpsgQouC04mlKc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HTDKT4-CE4nw0gGUgo14&sqi=2&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20b%20visscher%22&f=false">bore</a> at least eight Visscher children.

<p>John B. Visscher died in April 1825. His widow was the householder of record at 34 Columbia Street for a number of years. In December 1831, the newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=%22mrs.+catharine+visscher%22&source=bl&ots=GuL9ZlYEHJ&sig=K0f0gwsxn3KdW4L5b7Z4MnBTtIE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CNQSULSfMeP00gH8hYHgCA&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22mrs.%20catharine%20visscher%22&f=false">reported</a> Widow Sarah Willet was "buried from the residence of her daughter, Mrs. Catharine Visscher, corner of Columbia street and Middle lane."  

<p>Widow Visscher lived for another three decades. In 1834, a town house was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=B_M7vlQPa8kC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22catharine+visscher%22&source=bl&ots=LMWqGpPdJ9&sig=-2JFiyRjEpHA0k7dna-ogYYeSEk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wtUSUJH2L-Hi0QHsuoGQCQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22catharine%20visscher%22&f=false">built</a> for her and her children. It stands at 48 Columbia Street.

She had lived almost eighty-three years.

<p>Her will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> shortly after her death. However, in 1884, her <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H6N7homxoEcC&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=%22catharine+visscher%22&source=bl&ots=fAuIWO99cB&sig=JEwm6kBCuLmTud0IEJ68idPuI3s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ptQSUOiyBoqa0QHowIHgCQ&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22catharine%20visscher%22&f=false">estate</a> still was in litigation. </p>
