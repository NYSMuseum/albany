<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Abraham E. Wendell</B></A> was born in 
              1715 the third of the eleven children of Albany attorney <a href="evwendell2657.html">Evert 
              Wendell</a> and his wife <a href="../l/englansing3243.html">Engeltie 
              Lansing</a>. Called Abraham Evertse to prevent confusion with the 
              other Abraham Wendells then living in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
              County</a>, this Abraham did not marry. Without children of his 
              own, he lived first with his parents and later with his youngest 
              brother, <a href="phwendell2702.html">Philip Wendell</a> - who was 
              born in 1734.</P>
            <P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/awmill.jpg" align=right width=250 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Abraham E. Wendell and his mill"></a>As 
              the second son, Abraham seems to have been groomed to manage his 
              father's broad-based business assets while his older brother <a href="../w/jowendell2649.html">Johannes</a> 
              practiced law - a valuable connection for the young businessman. 
              His father's <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2657.html">will</a>, 
              written in 1749, named Abraham as co-executor and singled him out 
              for special consideration. Calling him "my dear trusty, faithful, 
              beloved, honest son," Evert Wendell left Abraham <a href="#property">extensive 
              property</a> on the southside of Albany, several additional <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">city 
              lots</a>, his farm on the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Normanskill</a>, 
              and all buildings (which included saw mills, grist mills, and a 
              brew house). Instructed to provide for Philip, Abraham also was 
              left his father's negroes after his mother's death. With the passing 
              of his father in 1750, thirty-five-year-old Abraham E. Wendell was 
              a wealthy Albany property holder and businessman.</P>
            <p>Perhaps because he had no family of his own, Abraham E. Wendell 
              did not achieve the political prominence of his father or of other 
              Wendell family members. Qualified to vote as early as 1742, he was 
              not elected or appointed to offices or positions in the Albany government. 
              He also did not become a pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
              church</a> until after the passing of his mother in 1769. Although 
              he was identified as a merchant in <a  href="../../census1756.html#75">1756</a> 
              and was assessed in the top five percent of city property owners 
              for two decades after, Abraham E. Wendell was conspicuous by his 
              absence from leadership positions in Albany business, politics, 
              and social life.</p>
            <p>In addition to his bachelor brother, their <a href="../../streets.html#state">State 
              Street</a> home included a number of slaves and also Margaret, an 
              "Indian squaw" whose indenture Abraham E. Wendell had purchased 
              in 1763. He survived the American Revolution without playing a visible 
              part and his pasture land was used as a haven for refugees in 1777. 
              In 1782, he was named executor of the will of his brother-in-law, 
              <a href="../s/bastaats4564.html">Barent I. Staats</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2739">1788</a>, 
              his first ward property was configured on the city assessment roll. 
              By <a href="../../census1790.html#2702">1790</a>, Philip Wendell 
              was living alone with five slaves in their first ward home.</p>

<p><a name=portrait></a><b>Portrait</b> of Abraham E. Wendell by <a href="../h/joheaton.html">John 
              Heaton</a> about 1737. This was one of seven commissioned portraits 
              of family members. See <i>Albany Institute of History and Art: 200 
              Years of Collecting</i>, edited by Tammis K. Groft and Mary Alice 
              Mackay (New York, 1998), 51-52. Another painting of AEW as a child 
              was done by Nehemiah Partridge about 1719. It will appear here in 
              the <a href="../../inprog.html">future</a>! All of these beautiful 
              paintings are in the collections of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany 
              Institute of History and Art</a>.

            <p><a name=property></a>The <b>Wendell property</b> 
              on the Southside of Albany extended south from the Wendell home 
              on upper State Street - opening up to include much of the land south 
              of State and west of South Pearl Streets. The boundaries of Wendell's 
              land are shown on the <a href="../../images/jpg/map1794.jpg">De 
              Witt map</a> of 1794 - which also show Wendell's mill complex on 
              the Beaverkill.</font size>
