<strong>Luykas Wyngaert</strong></a> was born in May 1704. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="jowyn6215.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="suwendell2719.html">Susanna Wendell</a> Wyngaert. Because his life coinsides with several same-named kin, this biography will confine itself to information on Luykas "J." Wyngaert. That individual grew up in a small family in a trader's house in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>Luykas J. seems to have had an Albany-based life. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1726">1726</a>, he was named constable for the second ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6222">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders in the second ward.

<p>Perhaps this individual was a bachelor as no family information appears in any of the likely sources. His subsequent will recognized no spouse or direct heirs.

<p>In 1748, his small lot near the wall in the third ward was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> of <a href="../t/dtbroeck33.html">D</a>irck Ten Broeck in relation to Ten Broeck's riverside property. In October of that year, a Boston newspaper announced that <a href="../slave/simon.html">Simon</a>, the slave of "Luykas Job. Wyngaard, of the City of Albany, Merchant," had run away.

<p>In July 1754, Luycas Johannes Wyngaert filed a <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6222.html">will</a>. He identified himself as an Albany merchant but that he was "very sick." It identified a number of friends in Albany and beyond who had befriended him over the years. The will passed probate in January 1755. This Luycas J. Wyngaert lived about fifty-one years. In December 1754, a New York <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL8334303M/Genealogical_Data_from_the_New_York_Post_Boy_1743-1773_(National_Genealogical_Society_Special_Publication)">newspaper noted</a> the burial of a fifty year old bachelor named Lucas Wyngaert and that he had left his estate of 12,000 to an acquaintance, Simon Veder.</p>
