          <P>The last European-born <a href="../../drc.html#domine">domine</a>, <A href="#biography"><B>Eilardus 
            Westerlo</B></A> was Albany's patriot minister during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American 
            Revolution</a>.</P>

<p>Born near Groningen, the Netherlands in October 1738, Eilardus was the <a href="#rn">son</a> of Reverend Isaac Westerlo - domine of the Reformed church of Denekamp. He was the eldest son in a large minister's family but lost his mother Hildegont Reiners died following the birth of a son, when Eilardus was twelve. Despite limited family rewources, young Westerlo was groomed to follow his father in the clergy and graduated from the University of Groningen in 1760. He came to America in that year to become pastor of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Reformed Church</a>.

<p>Arriving in Albany just past his twenty-second birthday at the end of October, Westerlo's long tenure in the only position he ever held mirrored his own transition from the formality of a European education and ecclesastical background to that of a more spirited and practical leader of a large and diffused congregation of "plain and experienced Christians." From the beginning, his commitment to the task made Westerlo a respected member of the Albany community. During the early 1770s, he became an active supporter of the "<a href="#union">Plan of Union</a>" adopted in America to heal a doctrinal rift within the Dutch Reformed Church. From his Albany base, he reached out to budding Reformed congregations across <a href="../../albanycounty.html"> Albany County</a>.</p>

<P>In July 1775, he married <a href="../l/calivingston5034.html">Catherine Livingston</a> - the young widow of patroon <a href="../vr/svr5114.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer II</a>. Already well-connected in the Albany community, that union elevated the then thirty-six-year old cleric to the top rung of the community's social ladder. For the next decade, the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Van Rensselaer Manor House</a> served as Westerlo's parsonage as well. By 1783, the marriage had produced three children including a prominent <a href="rewesterlo6868.html">son</a>.</P>

<p>From the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, Domine Westerlo was considered a warm supporter of the American cause - offering daily prayers for safety and victory and also ministering directly to the troops. He conducted a church school and trained a number of future clerics. Interested in secular as well as theological education, in 1779 he was named one of the trustees of the short-lived Clinton College. Westerlo preached primarily in his native Dutch. But, by 1782, he held an English-language service for the benefit of his American-born parishioners as well.</p>
  
<p>With the end of the war and the coming of age of Catherine's son, <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen</a>, the Westerlos moved back to Albany to the <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> parsonage the domine <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6867">occupied</a> for the rest of his life. By that time,  his health had begun to fail. In 1787, Brooklyn-born <a href="../b/jobassett.html">John Bassett</a> was made associate pastor and preached in English. Housebound, Westerlo still maintained an active correspondence with some of the leading clerics of his day.</p>

<p>Domine Westerlo <a href="#obit">died</a> in December <a href="../../census1790.html#6867">1790</a>. He was scarcely fifty-two-years-old and the last of the Dutch-speaking domines. His three-decade tenure stands as the longest in church history. The Albany County "hilltown" of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westerlo,_New_York">Westerlo</a>" was named for him in 1815. Westerlo Street in Albany's <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> also commemorates his illustrious career.</p>

<p><a name=rn></a>The latest and most comprehensive work on his life is translator Rob A. Nabourn's biographical edition of Westerlo's <a href="../../books.html#rn"><i>Memoirs</i></a>.
