<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Waldron</strong></a> probably was born in August of 1741. Thus, she would have been the youngest child of <a href="wwaldron678.html">Willem</a> and <a href="../b/elbeekman3907.html">Elizabeth Beekman</a> Waldron. However, she was not mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willwmwaldron.html">will</a> filed by her father in 1768. She grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a prominent businessman, mason, and city council member. 

<p>In April 1765, Elizabeth married Schenectady native <a href="../vi/frvi2354.html">Frederic Mynderts</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
At that time, church records noted that she was "of Albany." By 1791, eleven children had been christened in the Albany church where her husband was <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> mostly as "Meinersen."

<p>These Mynderses raised their family on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany in a <a href="../../census1800.html#2354">house</a> in the vicinity of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22mynderse+frederick%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22mynderse%20frederick%22&f=false">Hudson</a> and Liberty Streets. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, Elizabeth, her husband, and three adult females were counted in their household. 

<p>First in 1814, "Widow Mynderse" was identified in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as the householder at 39 Hudson. She was listed there thru 1819 but not afterwards.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Elizabeth Waldron Mynderts (Van Iveren). </p>
