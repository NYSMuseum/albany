      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Livinius / Levinius Winne</b></a> is said to have been born in Holland in 1647 and to have emigrated with his parents <a href=../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>   pioneers <a href="piwinne8568.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../a/adamswinne.html">Tannetje Adams</a> Winne. The Winnes soon settled in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. Livinius grew up in a large family at the family mill in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> and at his father's trading house in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Bev</a>erwyck/Albany. In 1684, he was left a share in his father's extensive <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne8568.html">estate</a>.</p>

<p>By the early 1680s, he had married <a href="../vb/tevburen.html">Teuntje Martens Van Buren</a>. By 1687, the marriage had produced four children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        where he was a member and frequent baptism sponsor. However, Teuntje Martens 
        died and Livinius married <a href="../v/wiviele6788.html">Willempie Viele</a> (widow of Simon Schermerhorn) 
        in June 1699. By 1705, three more children had been christened in Albany eventually constituting a large blended family.</p>
      <P>Livinius Winne was a tenant <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#2995">farmer</a> 
        in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> (probably 
        on <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a>) and a sometime resident 
        of Albany where he owned houses and lots. He served on Albany juries and 
        as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. The Rensselaerswyck 
        census in <a href="../../census1697.html#2995">1697</a> showed him as 
        a widower with two children in his household. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2995">1699</a>, 
        he joined his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England.</p>
		
<p>Livinius Winne died in November 1706. His widow married for the third time in 1709 and lived on for a number of years.</p>
