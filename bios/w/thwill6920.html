<strong>Thomas Willis</strong></a> (perhaps also known as <a href="../../res/sp.html">W</a>ilki/en/rson) probably was born before 1720. We seek information on his background and early life.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6920">1742</a>, a Thomas Wilkinson was included at the end of a list of <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> freeholders. 

<p>By the late 1740s, he had married Albany native  <a href="../r/raradcliff1183.html">Rachel Radcliff</a>. By 1769, nine children had been christened in Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and possibly other area churches as well.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#323">1756</a>, a census of Albany householders identified "Thomas Willis" as a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">weaver</a>. Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, city assessment rolls valued his first ward property modestly. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6920">1779</a>, his holdings again were located on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of the city.

<p>In March <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=%22thomas+wilkerson%22source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20wilkerson%22&f=false">1765</a> and December 1766, his (Thomas Wilkison) lots or pastures near the river and the Beaverkill were among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&dq=%22thomas+wilkison%22source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20wilkison%22&f=false">referenced</a> in a real estate description.

<p>After 1779, the name of Thomas <a href="../../res/sp.html">W</a>illis has not been found among the community-based resources encountered so far. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1183">1790</a>, his widow Rachel was listed on the census as the head of a first ward household.
