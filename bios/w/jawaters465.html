<P><a href="#sources"><b>Janet Waters Lansing</b></a> was born in 1723. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="../w/jowaters6823.html">John</a> and Sara Winne Waters.</p>


<p>She became the second wife of Albany gunsmith <a href="../l/gejalansing3705.html">Gerrit Jacobus Lansing</a> about 1748. Over the next two decades, seven of their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>During that time, these Lansings were prominent <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> residents until the latter stages of the War for Independnce when Gerrit Lansing died. Over the next decades, widow Janet continued to hold city property but probably lived in the home of her <a href="../l/salansing3671.html">daughter</a> or one of her sons. Among them were Chancellor <a href="../l/jolansing3755.html">John Lansing, Jr.</a> and businessman and State treasurer <a href="../l/abglansing3695.html">Abraham G. Lansing</a>.

<p>Living into her eighties, Janet Waters Lansing was dead by July 1805 when letters of administration were issued on her estate.</p>
