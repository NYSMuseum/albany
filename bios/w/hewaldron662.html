      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick Waldron</strong></a> was born in 
        May 1745 and christened at the Albany Dutch church. He was the son of 
        <a href="cowaldron649.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../vn/javness.html">Jannetie 
        Van Ness</a> Waldron of the "<a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Colonie</a>." 
        He grew up in the middle of a large family at the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Half 
        Moon</a> where his father died in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA184r&lpg=RA2-PA184r#v=onepage&q=&f=false">1756</a>. 
      <p>In November 1771, Hendrick was twenty-six when he married Rensselaerswyck 
        native <a href="../vv/mgtvvranken.html">Margarita Van Vranken</a> at the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1790, six children 
        had been christened in Albany. Between 1791 and 1796, at least three more 
        offspring were <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/helderb02.htm">baptized</a> 
        at the Heldeberg Dutch church in Guilderland. 
      <p>In March 1781, his brother-in-law or related by marriage, <a href="../g/jogates6507.html">John 
        Gates</a>, certified that Henry worked at the armory in Albany. Afterwards, 
        Waldron was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#662">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. Otherwise, 
        he seems to have tread lightly on the wartime community landscape. 
      <p>In May 1786, he was identified as the husband of Margaret Van Vranken 
        in the <a href="../../sources.html#en">will</a> filed by her father, Ryckert 
        Van Vranken of West Rensselaerswyck. 
      <p>After that, other than the birth of his children, the name of Henry Waldron 
        no longer appeared in the <a href="../../cbr.html">co</a>mmunity-based 
        record examined so far. 
      <p>Hendrick Waldron was not alive at the time of a brother's death in 1829.
