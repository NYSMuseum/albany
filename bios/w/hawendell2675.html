      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Harmanus A. Wendell</strong></a> was born in May 
        1744. He was the son of <a href="abwendell2740.html">Abraham H</a>. and 
        <a href="elwendell2674.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> Wendell. He 
        grew up in the upper State Street home of a prominent merchant but lost 
        his mother in 1757. In 1763, he was among those provided for (but not 
        by name) in the <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2663.html">will</a> 
        of his uncle. He was known as "Harmanus A. Wendell" to prevent confusion 
        with a number of same-named kin. 
      <p>In April 1770, he married <a href="../vd/chvdb5747.html">Christina Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She died in 1782. In March 1785, he married Catharina Wendell also at the Dutch church - where all ten of his children from the two marriages were christened.

<p>This lifelong Albany resident's life of community service  began in November <a href="../../org/cc.html#1774">1774</a>, when he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.  By <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2675">1779</a>, he had set up his home in the first ward where his property was valued on assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">rolls</a> in a number of locations for several decades. However, the census of <a href="../../census1790.html#2675">1790</a>  was more definite as it fixed the household of "Harmanus A. Wendell" on <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">upper State Street</a> near that of his father and included five family members and three slaves. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2675">1800</a>, the census showed him at the same location but as a widower with five children. However, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census of 1810</a> identified his residence as the "poorhouse" and counted a total of <a href="#58">fifty-eight persons</a> of all categories as residents. His precise connection to the <a href="../../poor.html">poor</a>house bears more intensive investigation.

<p>During the 1780s and 90s, he was identified as a member of Albany <a href="../../firemasters.html">fire</a> companies. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, his name was included on a first ward freeholder's list. At that time, he was identified as a tavernkeeper. 

<p>In March 1783, he was named as a nephew and heir in the <a href="../../wills/willgeewendell2872.html">will</a> filed by <a href="geewendell2872.html">Geesje Wendell</a> - a maiden aunt. In April 1793, he was named as the son and co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willabwendell2740.html">will</a> of his father.


<p>By <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=%22harmanus+a.%22+77+hudson&source=bl&ots=2hKsL-2t9C&sig=P6sv3y0S7v-MNyqFJBPQoFIVRC8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result">1813</a>, the first city directory was listing him as the superintendant of the market with an address of 77 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. Subsequent directories gave his address as 67 Hamilton Street and at 92 North Pearl Street. During those years, other people were identified as the "overseer of the poor" making the reference from 1810 even more puzzling.  

<p>He was active in the operations of the Albany Dutch church and was a member of the <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">Great Consistory</a> of 1815.

<p>Harmanus A. Wendell died in July 1819 at the age of seventy-five.</p>
