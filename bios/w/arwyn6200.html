<a href="#sources"><strong>Ariaantie Wyngaert</strong></a> was born in October 1703. She was the daughter of <a href="gewyn6208.html">Gerrit</a> and 
<a href="../v/savisscher4168.html">Sara Visscher</a> Wyngaert. She grew up in a large family in the home of a <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> merchant but lost her father in 1720. Her mother may have died earlier.

<p>In December 1721, she would have been eighteen when she married blacksmith <a href="../vi/myvi2466.html">Myndert Van Iveren</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Four months later, their first child was born. By 1737, six children had been christened there where both parents were  pewholders.


<p>In September 1760, she was <a href="../../wills/willmyvi2466.html">named</a> as the beneficiary of her husband's estate as long as she did not re-marry. The estate included several slaves. Myndert died about 1764. In 1767, "Widow Ar. Van Iveren" was identified as the owner of a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Ariaantie Wyngaert Van Iveren died sometime thereafter.</p>
