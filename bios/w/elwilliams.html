<strong>Elizabeth Williams</strong></a> probably was born prior to 1750.

<p>She was the wife of businessman-turned-Continental officer <a href="../m/germott.html">Gershom Mott</a>. The marriage produced at least two daughters.

<p>By the end of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, this Mott family was living in Albany. However, no account of their family has been found in the records ot the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Gershom Mott died in Albany in May 1786 at the age of forty-three. He was buried on May 27 from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He died intestate and letters of administration on his estate were granted to his widow.  

<p>Elizabeth <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#em">remained</a> in Albany and was listed on the census of <a href="../../census1790.html#em">1790</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Two years earlier, her house in the heart of the first ward was valued on the city <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#em">assessment roll</a>. But in 1793, her name was not mentioned in an account of the <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html">fire</a> that destroyed much of her part of the city. 

<p>But, by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, her name no longer appeared on Albany rolls.

<p>The Dutch church <a href="../../drc.html#sources">burial records</a> for July 28, 1805 noted a charge of eleven shillings for the pall and herse of "Widow Mott." </p>
