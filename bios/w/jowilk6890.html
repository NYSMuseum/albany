<strong>John Wilkinson</strong></a> probably was born during the 1740s. Several birth senerios are plausible including that he was an English emigr&eacute;. He also could have been a child in the large family of Albany residents Thomas <a href="../../res/sp.html">W</a>ilkinson or <a href="thwill6920.html">Thomas Willis</a>. The wide variety of <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>ellings encountered of "Wilkinson" - perhaps even encompassing variants of "Willis," complicate our task.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his name first appeared on an Albany assessment roll. In 1767, he was a sergeant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company - his rank possibly suggesting a military background.

<p>In April 1769, he married <a href="../m/anmarshall.html">Ann Marshall</a>  at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced several children who later became Albany <a href="thwilk6896.html">res</a>idents.

<p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, he first was named constable for the first ward. A few months later, he joined the Albany night watch. He served as constable and as high constable for several years.

<p>Probably still a young man during the 1770s, we expect to find him on wartime service rolls.
<p>After the war, he was paid for services several times from the city treasury. During these years, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house and holdings were <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6890">ass</a>essed <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6890">modestly</a>.
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6890">1790</a>, his household had eight members including five boys under sixteen. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot were included on the first ward assessment roll but his family was not configured on the Albany city census in 1800. However, in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the household of "John Wilkenson" with seven men, two girls, and two women appeared on the Albany census. After that, his name drops from Albany rolls.

<p>Later, a John Wilkinson (perhaps a son) was listed on the city directory at 203 South Pearl Street. We seek defining information on his later life and passing.</p>
