<strong>Willem Winne</strong></a> was born in April 1716. He was the son of <a href="dawinne.html">Daniel</a> and <a href="../vn/divness895.html">Dirckie Van Ness</a> Winne. He grew up in a large family on his father's <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farm. 

<p>In January 1745, he married Albany native <a href="../d/madwandelaer6185.html">Maria De Wandelaer</a> at the Schenectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  By 1758, the marriage had produced at least five children - most of whom were christened at the Albany church where he was a pewholder and later would serve as a deacon. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3121">1742</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3121">1763</a>, his name appeared on Albany  freeholders lists as a resident of the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1749">1749</a>, he was appointed a firemaster.

<p>This William Winne was a <a href="../../census1756.html#320">skipper</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#3121">merchant</a> who had some accounts with the Albany government. His third ward property was valued moderately on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. He was  called "captain" also because he was in charge of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he was into his sixties yet lent some support to the Revolutionary cause as he was called on to carry items on his boat. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3121">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<P>However, after the war, the name of Willem Winne no longer appeared on Albany rolls. Perhaps he had <a href="../../census1790.html#ww">retired</a> to a more rural home. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/cemw10.txt">Burial records</a> noted that he died in 1807.</p>
