<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Harmanus Wendell</strong></a> was born in March 1732. He was the son of Jacob and Helena Van Rensselaer Wendell.
<p>In May 1753, he married <a href="../b/barbradt4211.html">Barbara Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1776, the marriage had produced nine children who were christened in Albany. 

<p>Over the next decade, he began to take his place in early Albany society. He was a merchant and Indian trader who signed a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#2672">petition</a> of Albany businesssmen in 1764 asking the British for protection in the Indian country.

<p>In 1760, he began a life of service to the community when he was first appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward. He also served as overseer of roads and on the night watch. In 1766, he and <a href="../t/jotbroeck52.html">John Ten Broeck</a> were awarded custody of Albany's <a href="../../im/im1770.html">four docks</a> for a year.

<p>In November 1775, he was elected to represent the third ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Safety</a>. Re-elected semi-annually, he served until the committee disbanded in 1778. Then he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> for the third ward.

<p>Despite some question regarding his loyalty which became an issue in 1778, he <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html#2672">su</a>pported the American war effort and later was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2672">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.
 
<p>Harmanus Wendell died in June 1786 at the age of fifty-four. Attended by five slaves in <a href="../../census1790.html#4211">1790</a>, his widow carried on in their house until her death in April 1812.
