          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Pieter Winne</B></A> was the founder and patriarch 
            of the Winne family of early Albany. He was born in Ghent, Flanders 
            (Belgium) in 1609, the son of Franciscus and Anna Winne. Two decades 
            later, he had <a href="#marriage">married</a> Frieslander <a href="../a/adamswinne.html">Tannetje 
            Adams</a> and they began to raise a family.</P>

          <p>He brought that family to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> 
            during the 1650s where he became a tenant in the colony of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
            His farm was in the southwestern part of the manor called <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> 
            where he also operated a sawmill (probably along the Normanskill). 
            By the end of the decade he also was established in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
            - where he owned a house and became a <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#8568">prominent</a> 
            fur trader.</p>

<p>Subsequently, Winne gravitated more to the countryside where he held substantial lands. For several decades, farmer and mill operator Pieter Winne was one of the principal personages of Bethlehem. In 1672, he was appointed a magistrate for Bethlehem. He served until October 1684 when he was replaced. He was also active in the Albany Dutch church - serving in a number of capacities.</p> 
 
          <p>He wrote a will in 1677 and <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne8568.html">another 
            one</a> in July 1684. In the second will, he characterized himself 
            as a magistrate living in Bethlehem and that he was "sick in body 
            but of sound memory and understanding." It named his <a href="../a/adamswinne.html">wife</a> 
            as sole heir during her widowhood. It also identified their twelve 
            living children - whom he made his secondary heirs.</p>

          <p>Founder of a large regional family, Pieter Winne lived into his eighties. He 
            died during the early 1690s and his <a href="../a/adamswinne.html#marriage">widow 
            re-married</a> in 1693. His descendants were mainline residents of 
            colonial Albany and prominent throughout the region.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Pieter Winne</B> is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography 
            number</A> 8586. This profile is derived chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
            resources</a>. The traditional source of information on him is a sketch 
            printed in the <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm"><i>Van Rensselaer-Bowier 
            Manuscripts</i></a>, 845. It states that he emigrated to New Netherland 
            in 1653. The best online resource has been provided by <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~winnwilcox/pwinne.html">Robert 
            Winn</a>.</p>

<p><a name=marriage></a>Tradition holds that he was <b>first married</b> to an "Aechie Jans Van Schaick." But no mention of her or of any of her children was made in his will in 1684!</p>
