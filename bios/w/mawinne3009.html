<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Winne</strong></a> was born in October 1692. She was the daughter of Albany mainliners <a href="frwinne2113.html">Frans</a> and <a href="../g/elsgansevoort4654.html">Elsie Gansevoort</a> Winne. She grew up in a large family in the third ward home of a prosperous businessman, city official, and family leader. Her bachelor brother <a href="piwinne3032.html">Pieter</a> became the Winne patriarch even before their father passed away about 1720.

<p>In December 1719, Maria married <a href="../vb/bavburen.html">Barent Van Buren</a> of Kinderhook at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. By 1728, their marriage had produced four children who were christened at Albany and Kinderhook. However, Barent's <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Barent-Van-Buren/5609886690240028321">conflicted</a> demographic profile dictates caution in the assignment of family information. However, in August 1753, "Mattie" was named in the <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne3032.html">will</a> filed by her prominent brother. At that time, she was called the "wife" of Barent Van Buren. "Mattie" was among those bequeathed &pound;100. Barent Van Buren was a co-exectutor of Winne's estate and is said to have survived for a number of years.



<p>Maria Winne Van Buren is said to have been living in 1769 when she was provided for in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vjIRAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22barent+van+buren%22&source=bl&ots=1-Y1kSZNpF&sig=S1Eeq7tlZlzowcL1Jb72FNe5Cg4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg8q-34I7NAhXLaT4KHb8zA4Y4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=snippet&q=maria%20winne%20will&f=false">will</a> filed by Barent Van Buren, a yeoman of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> Precinct.

<p>We <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now seeking defining information on the passing of Albany native and Kinderhook resident Maria Winne Van Buren.</p>
