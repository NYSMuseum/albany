<strong>Johannes Luykasse Wyngaert</strong></a> was born about 1660, Because he later was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> he probably had been born in Europe. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers and Albany residents <a href="luwyn6218.html">Lucas Gerritse</a> and <a href="../vh/anvh748.html">Anna Van Hoesen</a>  Wyngaert.

<p>In April 1695, he married <a href="../w/suwendell2719.html">Susanna Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1704, the marriage had produced four children who were christened in Albany.

<p>His second ward home was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1697.html#143">1697</a>. Two years later, he signed a community-based <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6215">oath</a> pledging allegiance to the king of England. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">Assessment rolls</a> called him "Johannes Luykessen" and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6215">valued</a> his property comparable to other successful merchants. His <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house was mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willlovallen.html">will</a> of his one-time neighbor, Lourens Van Allen in 1712.

<p>Johannes Luykasse was a frontier <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who found himself in trouble with the law for illegal trading and for not having a liquor license. In 1707, he was called a "retailer of strong liquors" in the Albany records. He served his community as a juror, constable, and as high constable in 1704.  


<p>Johannes Luykasse Wyngaert was last heard from at the time of his naturalization in 1715 and was not listed on the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">county-wide</a> freeholders list in <a href="http://www.genealogy-quest.com/collections/nyalby.html">1720</a>.</p>
