<P><A href="#biography"><B>George Webster</B></A> was born in Connecticut in September 1762. He followed his twin brother to Albany after the conclusion of the <a href="../../or/or.html">Revolutionary War</a>.  They were the last children born to the large family of Matthew and Mabel Pratt Webster of Hartford.</P>

<P>George Webster was in Albany in 1784 when his brother, <a href="crwebster6841.html">Charles R. Webster</a>, reestablished the <a href="../../ag.html">Albany Gazette</a>. 
        He remained a printer for the remainder of his life. The Webster Brothers' 
        printery was located at the <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm 
        Tree Corner</a>. George lived one door up <a href="../../loc/statestreet.html">State 
        Street</a> at number <a href="../../census1800.html#6848">81</a> and Charles 
        next door at 83 State Street.</P>

      <p>The Webster Brothers were postwar Albany's leading <a href="https://library.villanova.edu/Find/Record/858504">printers</a> 
        and newspaper publishers. Besides the <i>Gazette</i>, they participated 
        in a number of less <a href="../../doc/nn1.html#1786">notable</a> printing partnerships. Their establishment 
        was a widely known regional landmark. Charles was more publicly visable 
        while George tended to the printing business. Both brothers were active 
        members of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. 
        George Webster was an officer for the Great Western Turnpike and a number 
        of benevolent organizations. In 1813 and 1818, he was elected assessor 
        for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.</p>

<p>In April 1799, George Webster <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=g-kRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22George+Webster%22+albany+bush&source=bl&ots=ivr8YH-0uQ&sig=KDagNi1s3Fyp_ebCgrm9qtDFNNo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EZkmVfD7INWAsQS6zIH4BA&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22George%20Webster%22%20albany%20bush&f=false">married</a> Massachusetts native <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/k/y/l/David-G-Kyle/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0808.html">Rachel Bush</a> in Providence, Rhode Island and brought her to his State Street home where they raised a number of <a href="http://www.billiecpa.com/Genealogy/john_webster.htm">children</a> (at least six) who were christened at the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a> where he was a member and trustee. Rachel died in Albany in 1808. George then married Sally Bush, his wife's younger sister, in 1810. That union produced at least three more children. </p>

<p>In 1820, he was listed alone at 81 State Street. Another George Webster (perhaps his son born in 1800) appeared in the city directory at 10 Fox Street.

<p>George Webster died in February 1823 at the age of sixty-one. He was eulogized as a bookseller and one of the editors of the <i>Albany Gazette and Daily Advertiser</i>.</p>
