<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Jellis Winne</strong></a> was born in November 
        1732. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck 
        native <a href="kiwinne2989.html">Kiliaen Winne </a> and his second wife, 
        <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady-born <a href="../f/refonda3839.html">Rebecca 
        Fonda</a> Winne. He grew up in a large, combined family in a woodworker's 
        home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
      <p>In May 1754, he married <a href="../vw/fyvwoert2514.html">Feytie Van 
        Woert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1777, thirteen children had been christened in Albany where he was a long-time member. 
<p>These Winnes set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a> where Jellis was a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> 
        and Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#2965">mainstay</a> for many 
        years. During the second half of the eighteenth century, his <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North 
        End</a> holdings were accorded modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>. 
        Perhaps his son was living with him and was listed under his home on the 
        assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2965">1788</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a>, he was appointed firemaster 
        in the third ward. In April <a href="../../org/cc.html#1772">1772</a>, 
        he was appointed watchman. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1784">1784</a>, 
        he was elected assistant alderman for the third ward and was re-elected 
        several times afterwards. In December 1784, he was appointed superintendant 
        of the <a href="../../loc/hospital.html">hospital</a> - by that time a 
        city-owned, multi-use shell. He was an active member of the city council 
        during the 1780s.
		 
<p>In his fifties at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">war</a>, Jellis Winne could be expected to have taken a less active role. In 1778, he was one of those who would be <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#2965">exempted</a> from military service because of his age. Earlier that year, however, his name appeared on the <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2965">roster</a> of those serving the Quartermaster General operating out of Albany. At that time, he was identified as "Waggon Master."

<p>In March 1784, Jellis witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willabvplanck1102.html">will</a> 
        of his friend and neighbor Abraham Ver Planck. 
      <p>In August of 1797, his house and stable on Watervliet (<a href="../../streets.html#market">North 
        Market</a> near the city line ) Street were destroyed by <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a>. 
        In <a href="../../census1800.html#2965">1800</a>, the census configured 
        his third ward home with two boys, an adolescent male, Jellis as the head, 
        three younger females, and his wife. 
      <p>Jellis Winne died in December 1804 and was buried from his church. In 
        October 1813, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of 
        administration were issued on his estate. <a href="jewinne2790.html">Jellis 
        Winne, Jr.</a> was either his grandson or his nephew.</p>
