<strong>Luykas Wyngaert</strong></a> was born in November 1686. He was the youngest son of Albany baker and trader <a href="luwyn6218.html">Luykas Gerritse</a> and his wife, <a href="../vh/anvh748.html">Anna Van Hoesen</a> Wyngaert. He was sometimes referred to as "Luykas Wyngaert, Jr."


<p>In 1709, he was left a house in Albany and one in Kinderhook in the <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6218.html">will</a> of his parents. He was instructed to make five payements for the benefit of his brother and sister.

<p>Like his father, Luykas was a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. He appears to have lived with his parents in their first ward house.

<p>He does not appear to have married as his will filed in 1754 mentioned neither wife nor children. In 1715, he belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company and to a <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#6219">troop</a> of horse as well.

<p>He was appointed constable in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1715">1715</a> and 1723 and served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in 1737. In  <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6219">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.


<p>A Luykas Wyngaert was mentioned in the community record in July 1748 when that person was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">ordered</a> by the city government to make a new bridge over the <a href="../../loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> and to help repair broken down bridges in Albany.

<p>In 1754, he may have been the cousin remembered in the <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6222.html">will</a> of Albany merchant <a href="luwyn6222.html">Luykas Joh. Wyngaert</a>.

<p>We seek additional information on the later life and passing of this individual.</p>
