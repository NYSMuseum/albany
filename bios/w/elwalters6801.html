<strong>Elizabeth Walters</strong></a> was christened in New York on November 1 1685. She was the first child born to the marriage of Robert and Catharina <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PyYxAAAAMAAJ&pg=PT21&lpg">Leisler</a> Walters of New York City. Her father was a merchant, originally from Plymouth, England, who would be appointed mayor of New York City in 1720. Her mother was the daughter of <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a>.


<p>By 1708, she had married Albany native <a href="../w/jowendell2944.html">Johannes Wendell, Jr.</a>. By 1728, twelve children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Wendells raised their family in a comfortable home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 

<p>In 1719, she was identified as the wife of John Wendell of Albany and named an heir (along with eight surviving siblings) in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RLIFAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0vxPx6XfSz77KYXvHq#PPA222,M1">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>Elizabeth Walters Wendell probably died sometime after her husband was buried in 1729.
