      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>James Wilson</strong></a> was a <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        merchant who was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA389&lpg=PA389&dq=%22james+wilson%22+sheriff+%22albany+county%22&source=bl&ots=Fjt70UhaNf&sig=53b3ZnRLCC5V2sc8NVdiQVYvlyg&hl=en&ei=9XdiTLelKISClAfr883nCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22james%20wilson%22%20sheriff%20%22albany%20county%22&f=false">commissioned</a> sheriff 
        of Albany County in October 1753. A month later, he appeared before the 
        Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> and was sworn 
        in. His tenure was short-lived as he was <a href="../../sheriffs.html">replaced</a> by <a href="../y/ayjr.html">Abraham 
        Yates, Jr.</a> in 1754. 
      <p>In August 1757, he married Magdalena <a href="../s/schermerhorn.html">Schermerhorn</a> 
        at the Schenectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their child 
        was born the following year. His wife was the daughter of a Schenectady 
        landholder who was left a substantial <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/schermerhorn/chronicles/2a.html#p7">inheritance</a>.

		 <p>It appears that two different, but same-named, individuals christened children with area <a href="../vd/mavdh5700.html">women</a> during the 1750s.  
      <p>Wilson probably was among those trying to establish a <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
        meeting house at Schenectady during the 1760s. Thus, he probably was of 
        Scottish origin. 
      <p>In May 1757, he identified as a Schenectady merchant when he purchased 
        a lot on Schenectady's main street. During the 1760s, he had business 
        dealings with Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> and Johnson's 
        trading network. 
      <p>James Wilson was still in Schenectady in 1771. 
      <p>Perhaps he was the former Albany resident named James Wilson who <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyherkim/cemeteries/wilsoncem.html">established</a> 
        a farm north of the Mohawk after the last French and Indian <a href="../../7yw.html">war</a>. 
        An aged (89th year) James Wilson was buried there in 1774.
		
<p>This individual does not seem to have been an actual Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">resident</a>. Many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> remain regarding his life. He is included here because of his brief tenure as <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> - which probably followed from his relationship with Johnson.</p>
