<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditiional sources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gorham A. Worth</strong></a> was born at/on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V5UPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&d#PPA13,M1">Quaker Hill</a> (Dutchess County) in 1782 <a href="http://history.vineyard.net/worthw3.htm">or</a> '83. Tradition holds that his family moved to Hudson when he was fifteen - a place Gorham considered to be his first home. He was the son of Quakers Thomas Worth and his third wife, Abigail Jenkins, who were among the <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> pioneers who came from Martha's Vineyard to establish the city of Hudson. His brother <a href="../../res/guess.html">or</a> cousin was General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jenkins_Worth">William J. Worth</a>.

<p>In November 1810, he married Lydia <a href="../../res/sp.html">D</a>akin of Hudson. The marriage produced at least seven children.

<p>After clerking in the business of a Hudson merchant, from 809 to 1811, he held the position of clerk of "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QrEPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=%22bank+fh%22+hudson&source=bl&ots=j7zjrcVdCA&sig=XVd3a172L76W_Kxjr-YRjVXrltE&hl=en&ei=3xCfSeDkE6TUMPeAkcUL&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result">Bank of Hudson</a>." 


<p>About age twenty, he removed to Albany. By <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22worth+gorham a.%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22worth%20gorham a.%22&f=false">1813</a>, he had taken the position of Cashier of the <i>Mechanics & Farmers Bank</i> in Albany at 151 Court Street. After 1816, his name no longer appeared in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a>.  

<p>Worth left Albany in 1817 seeking to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=thIwAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg">retire</a> from the turmoil of the banking business. He settled in Ohio but soon took the position of cashier of the United States branch bank in Cincinnati.

<p>By the 1820s, he was a banker in New York City whose career there was profiled in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=thIwAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg"><i>Old Merchants of New York</i></a>. 

<P>He was the author of a number of antiquarian works over a long period of time. After his death, his <a href="../../sources.html#rr">most remembered</a> contribution - an unpublished manuscript, was acquired by Joel Munsell and <a href="../../sources.html#rr">published</a> as <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V5UPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&d#PPA11,M1"><i>Random Recollections of Albany, from 1800 to 1808</i></a> in 1866. It certainly is required reading for all students of Albany history. At the same time, however, it is among the most notorious defenders of the persistence of Albany's so-called <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA193&dq=dutch+in+all+its+moods">"Dutchness"</a>."

<p>Gorham A. Worth died in New York City in April <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E01EFDC133DE034BC4C53DFB266838D649FDE">1856</a> at the age of seventy-three. He was survived by four sons and two daughters.</p>
