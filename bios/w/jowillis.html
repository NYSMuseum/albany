<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Willis</strong></a> probably was born before 1750. We expect to find material about his life under <a href="../../res/sp.html">varied spellings</a> including "Willis/Welles/Williamson." He may have been in Albany during the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">1760s</a>. 

<p>His wife was Jane Brett (probably not <a href="../b/bradt.html">Bradt</a>). Their son was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in July 1779.

 In September 1771, he was entered into the register as a communicant of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. Later that year, his name appeared on a <a href="../../coerec1771.html#1519">list</a> of church subcribers. At that time, he was identified as a "journeyman to Mr. <a href="../f/jefairchild8014.html">Fa</a>irchild, the blacksmith."
 
<p>In April 1776, he was the subject of a <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;rgn=full%20text;idno=ABP1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000408">complaint</a> to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> that he had been "speaking disrespectfully" about the American cause. He was ordered to appear but no follow-up entry is preserved in the committee's <a href="../../sources.html#cc">records</a>.    

<p>A woman named Sarah Osborn <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pgQlOaMMQOMC&pg=PA241&lpg=PA241&dq=%22sarah+osborn%22+albany+willis&source=bl&ots=CABM_OXQWI&sig=XnzCRWchydtQl9gvzjw13lEAR3s&hl=en&ei=QHRATIzIIMH78AbyyvEV&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22sarah%20osborn%22%20albany%20willis&f=false">later attested</a> that  during the winter of 1780 she lived at the Albany house of blacksmith John Willis and that she was married there.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1519">1779</a>, his lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was accorded a modest assessment. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1519">1788</A>, his personal property was valued under a third ward home.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of "John Willis" was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.

<p>We seek information the later life and passing of one-time Albany resident and <a href="../../trades/metal.html">metal</a> worker John Willis. Our quest is complicated by varied spellings of his name as numerous references to similarly named individuals exist for his lifetime and regional proximity.</p>
