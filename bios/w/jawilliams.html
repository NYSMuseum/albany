<P>The one-time Albany area resident known as <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Williams</strong></a> was born prior to 1740. His name has been encountered in a number of <a href="../../res/sp.html">variations</a> in the community-based record. We have yet to connect him to the Albany-based  <a href="thwilliams.html">Williams</a> family. Thus, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In November 1759, James Williams was married to <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Elizabeth Crofton at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. Over the next two years, two sons were christened there. Perhaps he was the "James Williamson" who was listed among the members in <a href="../../coerec1771.html#444">1771</a>. 

<p>In May 1760, the name of James Williams appeared on the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA12-PA553&lpg=RA12-PA553dq=james+williams&sig=KO3WO4tIB1dP9VDxGJLcFoFoa8s&id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&ots=hq0KulgrC3#v=onepage&q&f=false">muster roll</a> raised for Captain <a href="../vv/jovvechten2532.html">John Van Vechten</a>'s company in Albany County. That individual was listed as 39 years old, a native of <a href="../irish.html">Ire</a>land, and had been recruited out of "Staats" company. That document also identified him as a "bellismaker" and that he was 5'6", of "dark" complexion, with blue eyes and black hair. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Th</a>us, that individual probably would have been born during the 1720s.

<p>In May 1767, the name "James Williams" appeared on the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html">roster</a> of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a> company. At that time, he was identified as one of four sergeants in the company captained by Abraham C. Cuyler.

<p>During the 1760s, the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property of a "James Willimson" was valued modestly on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a>. 

<p>In 1793, the name of James Williams was listed among the creditors of the <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#jawi">estate</a> of William Charles.

<p>After that, the name of "this" James Williams has not been found in an Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>. Without defining demographic information, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now without making perhaps tenuous connections to same or similarly named (including Williamson) contemporaries at-risk in the region.</p>
