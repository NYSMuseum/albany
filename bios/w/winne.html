<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Winne</strong></a> family of early Albany descends from <a href="../w/piwinne8568.html">Pieter Winne</a> who emigrated from Belgium during the 1650s and settled in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">hinterland</a> around Beverwyck/Albany. His large family is articulated in a <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne8568.html">will</a> that he filed in 1684.

<p>The Winne family prospered in greater Albany County (<a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>) and maintained a consistent and sometimes notable presence in the city of Albany as well.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, two Winne-named households appeared on the Albany census and two more were listed in the <a href="../../census1697.html#rw">census</a> of Rensselaerswyck. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, Capt. <a href="piwinne3032.html">Pieter Winne</a> was counted among the freeholders of the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He represented Albany in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> for almost twenty years. In 1720, three other Winne-named freeholders were identified in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.

<p>The notorious <a href="http://www.jmkelleyltd.com/articles/antique1.html">old Winne place</a> in southern Albany County dates to the first part of the eighteenth century.
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#53">1756</a>, the household of cooper <a href="kiwinne2989.html">Kiliaen Winne</a> appeared on the census of Albany householders.

</p>By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, three Winne-named households remained in the city. However, twelve more Winne-named homes were listed on the 
<a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">census</a> of surrounding Watervliet.

<p>In 1815, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> identified thirteen Winne-named addresses that connected the family to every part of the community economy. Included was the Orange Street home of "<a href="wbwinne.html">Willie Winnie</a>" - the <a href="../../peoplestreet.html">three-penny postman</a>.

<p>Today, the family is numerous and well-recalled in the names of roadways in Albany and beyond.

This access page for the Winne <a href="../../familynames.html">family</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Because the first Pieter Winne had so many surviving children, the Winne family was one of the largest in old Albany County. A small percentage of his descendants found homes in the city of Albany.
