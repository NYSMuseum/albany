      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rensselaer Westerlo</strong></a> was born 
        in May 1776. He was the first child born to the marriage of Domine <a href="ewesterlo.html">Eilardus 
        Westerlo</a> and his wife, the widow <a href="../l/calivingston5034.html">Catherine 
        Livingston</a> Van Rensselaer. He grew up in a combined family at the 
        <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> until his older half-brother 
        <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer III</a> succeeded to 
        the title of Patroon in 1784. His father then moved their family into 
        the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Reformed</a> parsonage <a href="../../census1790.html#6867">on</a> 
        North Market Street. The elder Westerlo became ill and died at the end 
        of 1790. During the 1790s, Rensselaer Westerlo first became a pewholder. 
      <p>Young Rensselaer was educated at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_University#History">Columbia 
        College</a> in New York from where he graduated in 1795. He returned home 
        to Albany and <a href="../../census1800.html#5034">lived</a> in his widowed 
        mother's second ward home. 
      <p>During the 1790s, he was among the young men who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9bwRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=%22rensselaer+westerlo%22&source=bl&ots=MMBS2zeZwk&sig=FUjaE4zW-GohoB-OWkELD2wiB7I&hl=en&ei=cNanSrfLJJXAMI7AzbEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=%22rensselaer%20westerlo%22&f=false">represented</a> 
        New York State in diplomatic negotiations with the Iroquois. 
      <p>He was well-known in Albany circles as an attorney. He was the partner 
        of fellow Columbia alumnus <a href="../h/abhun4770.html">Abraham Hun</a>. 
      <p>Well-educated and trained to practice <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>, 
        he was able to acquire substantial <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        property</a> in Albany and beyond as well. He was a trustee and director 
        of a number of Albany-based civic organizations. He served in the New 
        York State militia, was a veteran of the War of 1812 (<a href="http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/published/uva-sc/viu00003.document">confidante</a> 
        of the Patroon), and was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Rd0TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1943&lpg=PA1943&dq=%22rensselaer+westerlo%22&source=bl&ots=0rQihdfx0f&sig=JeYksD1YEtY4XUaPrTJLPAxbdmw&hl=en&ei=8dCnStCOHozUMonr7ZoI&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=%22rensselaer%20westerlo%22&f=false">named</a> 
        brigadier general of the Albany cavalry in 1818.

<p>By 1810, his mother had passed on and Rensselaer Westerlo had married and was counted as the head of a second ward <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22rensselaer+westerlo%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22westerlo%20rensselaer%22&f=false">household</a> at what became 72 North Pearl Street.

<p>While living in his mother's home, he sustained a close relationship with his younger sister, <a href="cawesterlo6866.html">Catherine</a>, who would marry newcomer attorney and officeholder <a href="jowoodworth.html">John Woodworth</a> in 1810. In May 1805, Rensselaer Westerlo was almost thirty when he married twenty-year-old <a href="../l/janelansing.html">Jane Lansing</a>, daughter of the illustrious <a href="../l/jolansing3755.html">Chancellor</a>. The <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=%22rensselaer+westerlo%22&source=bl&ots=aLJBMlNivM&sig=o66OBIG75k7TXCoJWiFdj_IUnvc&hl=en&ei=ntGnSrK8NobcNrOC5LEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=%22rensselaer%20son%22&f=false">marriage</a> produced six children - none of whom appear to have raised their own families.

<p>In 1817, he was elected to represent Albany in the United States House of Representatives. A Federalist, he served one term and returned to his 
        legal practice. 
      <p>Rensselaer Westerlo died in April 1851 at the age of seventy-four. His 
        widow survived twenty years longer. </p>
