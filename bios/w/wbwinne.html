<P><B>William Bancker Winne</B> was born in 1769, the son of Albany tanner <a href="dawinne2849.html">Daniel K. Winne</a> and his second wife, Schenectady native <a href="../b/jabancker2852.html">Jannetje Bancker</a>. By that time, his father had secured some tanning  lots along Foxes Creek. Over the next two decades, Willie Winne and his brothers would learn the process that transformed animal skins into leather.</P>

          <p>By the 1790s, the young man began to purchase lots on the North Side of Foxes 
            Creek. At that time he probably <a href="../../census1790.html#2989">lived</a> 
            with his brother Killian D. Winne on the outskirts of Albany's <a href="../../wards.html">second 
            ward</a>. <a href="#image"><img SRC="../../images/jpg/wbwinne.jpg" ALT="William B. Winne" HSPACE=8 VSPACE=8 BORDER=0 width=150 align=left></a>By 
            1800, he was established in his own second ward household and was 
            the owner of several lots near the then northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">boundary</a> 
            of Albany. By 1804, he was identified as a cordwainer and was a member 
            of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.</p>

<p>From his home at 57 <a href="../../streets.html#orange">Orange Street,</a> Willie 
            Winne expanded his activities in a transition away from leather work. 
            He became a letter carrier - the "three penny post" who would deliver 
            mail anywhere in the city for 3 cents. According to his obituary, 
            he served in that capacity for 48 years. That occupation made him 
            an <a href="../../peoplestreet.html">everyday fixture</a> on Albany streets. In connection with the robbery of the home of <a href="../p/jopye.html">John Pye</a> and other exploits, Winne was among the more colorful and legendary <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=35cRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA382&lpg=PA382&dq=%22john+pye%22+watervliet&source=bl&ots=IIOGElre4E&sig=_Giqk0Vgay2IC1wnwmG_5fLs1aE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VBCgT4X5Bqfs0gH2gomqAg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22john%20pye%22%20watervliet&f=false"">characters</a> of early nineteenth century Albany. In August 1831, the "penny postman" had a seat amid the dignitaries in the first car on the <a href="http://www.histdocs.com/home/productpages/hr.php?img=240_hr.gif">first train ride</a> between Albany and Schenectady. <br>

<p>By 1816, he also was the "front door-keeper" at the Albany Theater and was toasted in the newspaper for "his long and meritorious services - having punctually fulfilled the duties of his station through wind and rain, fair weather and foul." At the same time, he maintained a connection to leathermaking and held a municipal post with the title "Inspector of Leather."</p>

William B. Winne continued to buy and sell real estate in the <a href="../../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor 
          Hill</a> section of the city through the remainder of his life. As the 
          years passed, he watched the Foxes Creek ravine change from a marginal 
          area dotted with tanning pits to a working-class, residential neighborhood. 
          His wife, Rebecca, died in 1845. Willie Winne then was left alone in 
          the wooden house on Orange Street four doors up from Chapel until his 
          death at age 90 in January 1848.<p></p>
