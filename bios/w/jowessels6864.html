<p>He was the husband of Geertruy Hieronimus (the widow of William Hoffmeyer). Their marriage produced at least three children. In 1657, he sued his stepson (William Hoffmeyer) for a house. He appeared frequently before the local courts! In 1658, he sold a house and lot in Beverwyck to <a href="../vd/woavdu.html">Wouter Albertse</a> - another baker.</p>

      <p>In 1660, his name was on a <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6864">list of 
        people</a> petitioning the court for more freedom in pursuit of the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur 
        trade</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6864">1679</a>, his home was included on a list of Albany householders.</p>


<p>Jochem Wessels filed a will in February 1681. He died later that year.</p>
