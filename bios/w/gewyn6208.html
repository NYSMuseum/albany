<strong>Gerrit Luykasse Wyngaert</strong></a> probably was born about 1670. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="../w/luwyn6218.html">Lucas Gerritse</a> and <a href="../vh/anvh748.html">Anna Van Hoesen</a> Wyngaert. He was called "Gerrit Luykasse."

<p>In November 1694, he married Albany native <a href="../v/savisscher4168.html">Sara  Visscher</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1710, eight children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#160">1697</a>, his budding family was enumerated on the Albany census. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6208">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. After living in the second ward, he took up residence on the south side of upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. That property was valued moderately in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6208">1709</a>. He also owned  another house in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>Gerrit Luykasse was a merchant and trader who held no civic offices but did serve on Albany juries and appeared before the court as well. In 1705, he was named manager of the repairs made to the "Indian Houses."

<p>Gerrit Luykasse Wyngaert probably was dead by 1720.</p>
