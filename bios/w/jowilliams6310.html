<strong>John Williams</strong></a> was born in April 1719. He was the son of <a href="../w/thwilliams.html">Thomas Williams</a> and his second wife, <a href="../b/hibronck3875.html">Hilletje Bronck </a> Williams. He grew up in a large combined family at his father's tavern on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. He was named in the <a href="../../wills/willthwilliams6326.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1761.</P>

<p>In January 1744, he married <a href="../b/cobogardus6360.html">Cornelia Bogardus</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1757, four children had been christened in Albany where he was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1741">1741</a>, he was named constable for the first ward. A decade <a href="../../org/cc.html#1751">later</a>, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. His accounts were paid by the city. In 1767, he belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. However, his name did not appear on community freeholders <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">lists</a>.

<p>In July 1754, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6222.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor.  
<p>John Williams was a <a href="../../census1756.html#92">barber</a> who lived near other family households in the first ward. During the 1760s and 70s, his first ward property was given a moderate valuation on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, his was elected assistant alderman for the first ward. He was involved in city business and also was able to obtain a deed for an additional lot within the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a>. In 1773, his first ward home had boarders. 

<p>In May 1775, he was named captain of the first ward watch. In 1776 and 1777, he was elected to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> for the first ward. In June 1776, he was serving as deputy chairman. Over the next year (until April 1778), he was very active in committee business - often serving in postiions of trust. 

<p>Our last references to John Williams came in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a> when his house and lots appeared on the city assessment rolls. He may have been deceased or probably died about that time.

 <P>John Williams was dead by May 1784 when his widow was transacting business with the city government. Cornelia Bogardus Williams died in July 1787.</p>
