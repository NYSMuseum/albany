<strong>Claes Luycasse</strong></a> was born about 1665. He probably was the kinsman if not the son of <a href="luwyn6218.html">Luykas Gerritse</a> and <a href="../vh/anvh748.html">Anna Van Hoesen</a>  Wyngaert. He grew up in a Luykas Gerritse's large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a trader/baker. He probably was included as one of the three men in that  household on the Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#133">census</a> taken in 1697. 

<p>We suspect that he was not the son of Luykas and Anna as their <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6218.html">will</a> filed in 1709 named another as eldest son and ignored Claes altogether.

<p>It appears that Claes did not marry but was a regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> thru 1726.

<p>His name began to appear in city records in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#426">1699</a> when he signed a loyalty oath. In 1702 and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#426">1709</a>, he first ward property was valued on the Albany assessment rolls. 

<p><a href="../../org/cc.html#1702">1702</a>, he was appointed collector in the first ward. Over the next two decades, he served the community as assessor, surveyor, <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, and juror.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#426">1720</a>, the name of "Nicholas Winegaert" appeared near that of other Wyngaerts on a list of freeholders in the first ward.

<p>Claes Luycasse Wyngaert was buried by the Dutch church in December 1730. </p>
