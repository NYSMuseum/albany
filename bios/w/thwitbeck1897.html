<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas L. Witbeck</strong></a> was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in August 1752. He appears to be the only child born to the marriage of Lucas and Catarina Carter Witbeck. Perhaps, she was Lucas Witbeck's second wife. This historically visible resident mostly was known as "Thomas L. Witbeck."

<p>In September 1766, "Thomas L. Witbeck" witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjavvlk.html">will</a> of an Albany carpenter. At sixteen, <a href="../../res/guess.html">p</a>erhaps our subject would have been too young to testify to a legal transaction. Was this distinctively named individual born much earlier than his recorded christening?
  
<p>In April 1773, marriage <a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">bonds</a> were issued to Albany glazier Thomas L. Witbeck and spinster "Stantia Gose" of Albany County. We seek information on their marriage. One <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2003-02/1045438421">presently compelling source</a> tells us that his wife was a cousin named "Ariantie Witbeck" and that they had nine children who were christened in Lutheran churches in what became Columbia County beginning during the late 1770s.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1774">1774</a>, he was named fireman for the second ward.

<p>Coming of age during the early 1770s, we seek information for his involvement in Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>-related activities. In 1775, he contributed eight shillings for Ticonderoga. He also acted as a messinger for this <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> during the war years. Two men identified simply as "Thomas Witbeck" were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">listed</a> on the wartime rolls of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> in east bank regiments.

<p>He was a prominent <a href="../../doc/1788afc.html">Federalist</a> and was the assistant marshall in the Albany ratification parade in August 1788. 

<p>He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#1897">masonic lodge</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1897">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> and was located next to the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a>. However, two years earlier, his property and the "house he lives in" had been valued on the Albany <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1897">assessment roll</a> for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/guidedisplay.pl?index=V000012">1793</a>, Thomas L. Witbeck wrote the <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Patroon</a> regarding elections and appointments in Rensselaer County. Around that time, he was <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:meUp7Du0KU0J:www.hartgen.com/userfiles/Social%2520History%2520of%2520the%2520Van%2520Alen%2520house.pdf+%22thomas+l+witbeck%22&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjyU8zbYVOdTXtzU4HynpPKfNS97CPYJpiEVceVKEqSP3UMFHMwFfbhLWuWK9wlWWU_ejcdNpJjqK3IxM0sxAjbyJOc7nDJl7yaodMfdbnxG3_vHI0MsjP6XlULfuhkyykyvQCv&sig=AHIEtbRrrlU9_-Er27DLurszvE4NfWPPxA">identified</a> as Van Rensselaer's lawyer and the friend of John E. Van Allen. Their relationship <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:meUp7Du0KU0J:www.hartgen.com/userfiles/Social%2520History%2520of%2520the%2520Van%2520Alen%2520house.pdf+%22thomas+l+witbeck%22&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESjyU8zbYVOdTXtzU4HynpPKfNS97CPYJpiEVceVKEqSP3UMFHMwFfbhLWuWK9wlWWU_ejcdNpJjqK3IxM0sxAjbyJOc7nDJl7yaodMfdbnxG3_vHI0MsjP6XlULfuhkyykyvQCv&sig=AHIEtbRrrlU9_-Er27DLurszvE4NfWPPxA">seems</a> to have focused on Rensselaer County <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>. In 1794, he became <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">holder</a> of a lease on a Manor farm. 

<p>In 1794, he owed 11 shillings to the <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html">estate</a> of Albany resident William Shepherd. 

<p>In 1796, he is <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/margaret-e-burden-proudfit/henry-burden-uor/page-4-henry-burden-uor.shtml">said</a> to have erected a flour mill on the Wynantskill.

<p>In 1797 or 98, Aaron <a href="../b/aaburr.html">B</a>urr's legal papers <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oCnS1rGzY5sC&pg=PA583&lpg=PA583&dq=%22thomas+l+witbeck%22&source=bl&ots=w5KrihcuWR&sig=SMGT07zDUCXshCvFu41YFltL3Cc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=njZrT8hphYjRAZuX4dAN&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20l%20witbeck%22&f=false">extensively discussed</a> Witbeck's involvement and credit situation regarding acreage at "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q-5JAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA424&lpg=PA424&dq=presque+isle+tract+%22holland+company%22&source=bl&ots=0AgcxZPGTi&sig=6WaY4IOxWxZ9rwCgyxht0LSGfDU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HeltT-uNJMj30gGw-bzZBg&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=presque%20isle%20tract%20%22holland%20company%22&f=false">Presque Isle</a>."

Witbeck" as well.

<p>After the late 1790s, the name of Thomas L. Witbeck seems to have dropped from the public record. This individual was a one-time city resident who later became more closely identified with activities and holdings on the eastern side of the Hudson River. He also was involved with lands located in western New York and beyond. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his later life and passing.</p>
