      <P> According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> 
        <strong>Daniel Winne</strong></a> may have been born as early as 1663. 
        He was a younger son in the large family of New Netherland pioneers <a href="piwinne8568.html">Pieter</a> 
        and <a href="../a/adamswinne.html">Jannetje Adams</a> Winne. He grew up 
        on his father's farm south of Albany in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. He was named among the twelve surviving children listed in the <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne8568.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1684.

<p>In March 1698, he married <a href="../vn/divness895.html">Dirckie Van Ness</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1726, ten children had been christened in Albany where both parents were members.

<p>These Winnes set up their home in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> where he had established a home and was living alone in <a href="../../census1697.html#dw">1697</a>. Later, he may have owned or leased some <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> along the river road. 

<p>Daniel Winne belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>, appeared as a witness in Albany, and was identified as a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">freeholder</a> living in Rensselaerswyck in <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyalbany/census/1720.html">1720</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#dawi">1742</a>..</p>

<p>Daniel Winne filed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA482,M1">will</a> in January 1751. It stated that he was a "yeoman" and was living in Rensselaerswyck. It identified Dirckie and eight living children as the heirs to his real and personal property. Following his death, the will passed probate in March 1757. </p>
