<P>According to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=:1035833&id=I2732">family-based</a> resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Daniel Ward</strong></a> was born in February 1772. He was the son of <a href="urward6807.html">Uriah</a> and Jemima Harrington Ward of Worcester, Massachusetts. He grew up in central Massachusetts and probably <a href="../../yankinv.html">moved west</a> with his parents when they re-located to Albany during the 1790s.

<p>In May 1797, he married Martha Bemis of Worcester. By 1807, four children had been christened in Worcester as well. 

<p>Probably during the later 1790s, he migrated with his father to Albany where he joined Uriah and Jemima on the census in 1800 but was listed in a separate first ward <a href="../../census1800.html#6803">household</a> that included four young men, four young women and two children. Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> house and holdings were assessed modestly.

<p>After a brief sojourn <a href="../../census1800.html#6807">in</a> Albany, Daniel's parents probably returned to Massachusetts where his mother died in 1807. But, by the end of the decade, their son and his growing <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">family</a> had settled in Albany permanently.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22ward+daniel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22ward%20daniel%22&f=false">1813</a>, the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> identified him as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> with an address on <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a> "opposite the Fly Market." Later, he would be known as a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a>.


  
<p>Daniel Ward died in 1827. This transplanted Yankee had lived only fifty-five years.</p>
