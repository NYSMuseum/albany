      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Harmanus H. Wendell</strong></a> was born 
        in April 1714. He was the youngest son of <a href="hawendell2667.html">Harmanus</a> 
        and <a href="../g/anglen4917.html">Anna Glen</a> Wendell. He grew up in 
        a large family in a <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">landmark home</a> 
        on upper State Street. He also was known as "Harmanus H." or "Harmanus 
        Wendell, Jr." 
      <p>He grew up in a large family in a prominent trader's home on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State 
        Street</a> but lost his father in 1731. Perhaps his own marriage was delayed 
        several years to help his widowed mother maintain the family properties. 
      <p><a name=wife></a>In March 1742, he was twenty-eight when he married Albany 
        native <a href="../vv/cavvechten2398.html">Catharina Van Vechten</a> at 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1756, the marriage 
        had produced nine children. Perhaps his wife died following the birth 
        of her last child. If so, did this Harmanus Wendell marry Catherine Glen 
        in Schenectady in 1762? 
      <p>This Wendell family may have <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">lived 
        first</a> in the second ward but soon settled down in a prominent <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
        Street</a> location. 
      <p>Harmanus H. Wendell was a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#names">leading 
        member</a> of the the Albany <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">business</a> 
        community. Like many <a href="../../census1756.html#311">merchants</a>, 
        his assets also included substantial <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        estate</a> located in greater Albany County and beyond. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1748">1748</a>, he was elected assistant 
        alderman for the third ward and was re-elected for several years following. 
        He was an active member of the county judiciary and often referred to 
        as "Judge" Wendell. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2669">1763</a>, the name "harmanus 
        H. wendell" appeared on a list of freeholders in Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">County</a>. 
        During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his Albany 
        holdings were valued moderately. 
      <p>Harmanus H. Wendell filed a <a href="../../wills/willhawendell2669.html">will</a> 
        in May 1769. It named his wife, Catharine, and several children as heirs. 
        He died in February 1771. The will passed probate in April.</p>
