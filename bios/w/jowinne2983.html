<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Winne</strong></a> was christened at the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> Dutch church on July 30, 1735. He was second of seven sons born to the marriage of Levinius and Susanna Wendell Winne. His parents were <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> Albany city residents. He was often <a href="../../res/sp.html">kn</a>own as "Jan Winne" (sometimes John Winne) although other similarly named individuals lived in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">area</a> during his lifetime.

<p>In March 1758, he marrried "Santje" <a href="../d/sadridder.html">Susanna De Ridder</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1777, the marriage had produced six children. In 1762, he buried his mother from the Albany church.

<p>This Jan (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> John) Winne was an Albany city resident at least during the 1760s and 70s. He <a href="../../res/guess.html">prob</a>ably was the John Winne who was the captain of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment during that time. In 1767, Winne's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA825&lpg=RA12-PA825&dq=&source=web&ots=hq0MrgbxF_&sig=7sibr8RsHv3rSzUurCrKg6LWnGQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">company</a> was composed of mostly city residents.

<p>During the early 1770s, a number of John <a href="../../res/sp.html">W</a>innes are <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/papersofsirwilli14johnuoft#page/635/mode/2up">referenced</a> in the <a href="../../sources.html#jp"><i>Papers of Sir William Johnson</i></a>. Winne also was identified as a militia officer, skipper, and  the <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/papersofsirwilli14johnuoft#page/172/mode/2up">partner</a> of Douw.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2983">1763</a>, John Winne's name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2983">1779</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> holdings were valued substantially. 

<p>In his mid-thirties at the outbreak of hostilities, we expect to be able to account for his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. A number of John Winnes served the American cause in Albany County and in New York State. However, community-based sources reference his contribution of &pound16 along with John Douw for the relief of Ticonderoga in May 1775. In January 1778, "John Winn" was one a number of men <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/ABP1949.0001.001/931?rgn=full+text;view=image">arrested</a> by soldiers for being drunk and not working for Capt. <a href="../a/elarnold7161.html">Eli. Arnold</a> as a cooper. That individual also was judged to have been an Albany resident.

<p>After the war, a number of similarly named individuals are at risk and we <a href="../qqqq.html">hesitate</a> to connect this individual further. Thus, we step back from those known as "Jan Winne" at this time.
 
<p>A Jan Winne died in March 1797 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church. In June, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in Albany County.</p>
