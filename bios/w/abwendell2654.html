<strong>Abraham Wendell</strong></a> was born in 1678. He was the eldest son in the large family of Albany leaders <a href="jowendell2942.html">Johannes</a> and his second wife, <a href="../s/elsstaats99.html">Elsje Staats Wendell</a>. His father died in 1692 leaving Elsje a widow with eleven children.</p>

<p>In 1691, he was named, along with his mother and ten siblings, as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">will</a> filed by his father.

<p>In 1695, about the time of his mother's marriage to <a href="../s/joschuyler100.html">Johannes Schuyler</a>, Abraham was sent to New York City to learn business and trade.

<p>In May 1702, he married Katrina De Kay. By 1717, the marriage had produced nine children who were baptized at the New York <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps three more children were born to them after 1717.

<p>As an adult, Abraham was a successful import merchant in New York and later in Boston.

<p>This Abraham Wendell died and was buried in Boston in September 1734. His widow lived a year longer. In 1725, their daughter, Elizabeth, married Judge Edmund Quincey. </p>

The life of Abraham <a href="wendell.html">Wendell</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 2654. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.

<br><dd>Because he lived most of his substantial active life beyond Albany - and perhaps never returned after leaving the first time in 1695, the accomplishments of this Abraham Wendell (2654) are not chronicled on this website.
