<P><a href="#sources"><b>Thomas Williams</b></a> was an Englishman who emigrated to New York during the latter part of the seventeenth century. By the early 1690s, he had settled in Albany where he was the partriarch of the Albany Williams family.</p>


<p>This "young man of [from] New York," married brewer's daughter <a href="../g/aggansevoort2102.html">Agnietje Gansevoort</a> in 1692. By 1708, their nine children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors. Agnietie Gansevoort died about 1710. In 1712, Thomas took for his second wife <a href="../b/hibronck3875.html">Hilletie Bronck</a> - the mother of six more Williams children.</p>

<p>Williams's tavern and home on the east corner of Green and Hudson Streets were in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where for more than fifty years he was a <a href="../../census1697.html#101">prominent resident</a> who owned several lots in Albany and in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> as well.</p>

<p><a href="../../doc/cc/0627699.html">Cited</a> more than once for charged for <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> without possessing the "freedom of the city," his status improved dramatically when he was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County in 1699. He served as sheriff at different times during the first three decades of the eighteenth century. In 1700, he petitioned the city council to build a jail or prison in Albany. His <a href="../w/thwilliams6326.html">son</a> was named sheriff in 1748.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1704">1704</a>, he was elected alderman for the first ward and appeared in Albany courts as plaintiff, juror, notary, and frequently as an attorney. At court, he seems to have been connected with <a href="../c/jcollins.html">John Collins</a> - Albany's first professional attorney. He was a contractor for the city, delivered supplies to the garrison at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>, and worked for the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a> as well.</p>

<p>In 1714, he was among the supporters of the initiative that led to the founding of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. He was a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6285">mainline</a> community member, continued to appear in court as an advocate, and in 1728, was identified as "a gentleman of Albany."</p>  

<p>Thomas Williams died in November 1752 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church. He had lived in Albany for more than sixty years. His descendants became well established in eighteenth century Albany.</p>
