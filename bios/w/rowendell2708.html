<strong>Robert Wendell</strong></a> was born in September 1683. He was the eldest son in the large family of <a href="evwendell2656.html">Evert Wendell, Jr.</a> and <a href="../s/elsanders1416.html">Elizabeth Sanders</a> Wendell. He was named for his maternal <a href="../s/rosanders.html">grandfather</a>. He was identified as seven-years-old in the <a href="../../wills/willevwendelljr.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1690. Evert Wendell, Jr. died in 1702 when Robert was still eighteen. In 1706, his mother <a href="../v/frhvisscher4069.html">re-married</a> - thus further connecting these Wendells to the prominent Visscher family.
 
<p>Destined for the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>, he was appointed "collector" for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1706">1706</a>. In 1707, he accused the <a href="../h/hholland8489.html">sheriff</a> of underhanded dealings with <a href="../s/joschuyler100.html">Johannes Schuyler</a>. At that time, he was identified as an "Indian trader." 

<p>His business experience recommended him to be appointed <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">quartermaster</a> of the Albany troop of militia in 1715.

<p>This Robert Wendell does not appear to have married. He was, however, a regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>In July 1718, the lot of ground he owned in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> was <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/aukes.html">referenced</a> in a deed.


<p>Robert Wendell died in April 1750 and was buried from the church.</p>
