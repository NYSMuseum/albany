<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Patrick Walsh</strong></a> lived in Albany in 1800. In that year, his household in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">sec</a>ond ward was <a href="../../census1800.html#6800">configured</a> on the city census. It consisted of a couple aged 46 to 55 and four girls ten or under. His was one of <a href="#walsh">four</a> Walsh-named households (including that of prominent entrepreneur <a href="dudwalsh.html">Dudley Walsh</a>) listed on that second Federal <a href="../../census1800.html">census</a>. At this point, we are uncertain about kinship connections to other Albany Walshes. At the same time, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.
 
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property alone was valued modestly in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> - perhaps on or near <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a>.
 
<p>In November 1799, he was among the parishioners of <a href="../../org/stmarys.html">St. Mary's</a> Catholic Church who sent a <a href="../../org/stmarys.html#test">letter</a> to <a href="../../doc/carroll1776.html">Bishop Carroll</a> praising the service of the "late pastor <a href="../../org/stmarys.html#mob">Rev. O'Brian</a>." 

<p>In February 1808, the coroner <a href="#cor">referenced</a> his investigation of the death of "Betty Walsh, wife of Patrick Walsh," who was found dead in bed. The source for that reference (as well as information on his dead wife) is temporarily unknown.

<p>After that, the name of Patrick Walsh appears to be absent from the community-based record. Past diminishing returns and still missing critical defining information, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> from the life of Albany resident Patrick Walsh.
