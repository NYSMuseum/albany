<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>John J. Wendell</strong></a> was born in June 1751. He was the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA184-IA22&lpg=PA184-IA22&dq=johannes+j+wendell+sara+bergen+albany&source=bl&ots=-_A8y5LTbq&sig=i1Sk77TgHIavEAluoAIsnpZWAHw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiu6fmm3NvTAhUFWCYKHVjnBNMQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&q=johannes%20j%20wendell%20sara%20bergen%20albany&f=false">son</a> of Albany residents  <a href="jojwendell2951.html">John J.</a> and <a href="../b/sabergen.html">Sara Bergen</a> Wendell. To help prevent confusion with a number of same-named kin, he mostly was known as "John J. [<a href="../../res/sp.html">or I.</a>] Wendell." We have developed this sketch mostly incorporating sources that reference him in that way. We are aware that a disturbing number of contemporaries were known by that name and strive to not compress/conflate/confuse them in these presentations. 

<p>In December 1772, he appears to have married an older <a href="../h/alhoog3585.html">Alida Hooghkerk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1781, at least four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2977">1779</a>, "his" personal property only was valued probably in association with a <a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>oogkerk house in the first ward. On an assessment roll drawn in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October</a> of that year, he was assessed a similar tax again in close proximity to the Hooghkerks.

      <p>In his twenties during the conflict, we seek to flesh out his wartime activities. 
        We feel that the following bits represent only the tip of his <a href="../../or/or-as.html">service</a> 
        iceberg. In May 1775, <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> accounts 
        showed that John J. Wendell was among those residents of the first ward 
        who subscribed a few shillings for the relief of Ticonderoga. In November 
        1776, John J. Wendell was reimbursed by the <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/ABP1949.0001.001?type=simple&rgn=full+text&q1=john+j+wendell&submit=Go">Albany 
        Committee</a> for carrying letters to the "different Colonels of this 
        County." In March 1779, a letter from <a href="../l/morlewis.html">Morgan 
        Lewis</a> to George Washington <a href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/03-19-02-0372">identified</a> 
        John J. Wendell as the bearer of the letter and as the "overseer and clerk 
        of public stables at Albany." Thus, he served under Lewis's command. Following 
        the end of the war, name of John J. Wendell appeared on a list of Albany 
        city militia members who qualified for a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2977">land 
        bounty right</a>. 
      <p>John J. Wendell died in April 1786. He had lived but thirty-five years. Just a few years later in <a href="../../census1790.html#3585">1790</a>, Alida was identified as the head of a first ward household. Their <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=88799966">family monument</a> now stands in <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>. </p>
