      <P>The story of the <a href="#sources"><strong>Waldron</strong></a> family 
        of early Albany begins with the arrival of Manhattan-born <a href="pwaldron668.html">Pieter 
        Waldron</a> during the early 1700s. Pieter's <a href="../anglo.html">Eng</a>lish 
        ancestry but Holland-born <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/William-Waldron/6000000006444616929">father</a> 
        had emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and subsequently 
        established the Waldron family in New York City. The Albany branch descends 
        from Pieter and <a href="../vd/cavdb5740.html">Tryntie</a>'s large family. 
        Their daughter <a href="rewaldron672.html">Rebecca</a> was the mother 
        of Albany attorney and regional operative <a href="../y/pwyates.html">Peter Waldron Yates</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#668">1720</a>, Pieter was the only 
        family member to appear on a list of Albany freeholders. His death at 
        age fifty curtained the family's emergence until his sons came of age 
        after their father's passing. 
      <p>Only the name of eldest son <a href="wwaldron678.html">William Waldron</a> 
        was included on a list of eligible voters in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#678">1742</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, a census of householders 
        taken by the British army showed three Waldron-named households (<a href="wwaldron678.html">William</a>, 
        <a href="pwaldron671.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../../census1756.html#324">Mrs.</a> 
        Waldron) in the city. Those residences represent the height of the family's 
        prominence in Albany. 
      <p>During the 1760s, a variety of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">survey 
        lists</a> document the <a href="../../res/sp.html">Waldron</a> presence 
        in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. At that 
        time, three separate households were noted at the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. 
      <p>In 1775, both Pieter and Cornelis Waldron were among the Albany <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n1021/mode/1up">subscribers</a> 
        for the relief of Ticonderoga. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#671">1779</a>, only the first 
        ward lot owned by Pieter Waldron appeared on Albany assessment rolls. 
      <p>After the end of the War for Independence, the names of Cornelius and 
        <a href="hewaldron662.html">Henry Waldron</a> appeared on a list of those 
        eligible for a "<a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">bounty right</a>" in 
        conjunction with the Albany city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        regiment. 
      <p>By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, no Waldron-named households 
        appeared on the city census while at least two Waldron families were living 
        in surrounding <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. Statewide, 
        as many as forty <a href="../../res/sp.html">Waldron</a>-named households 
        were enumerated on the first Federal Census. The majority of them were 
        located in New York City and its environs. 
      <p>Waldron <a href="../bioindex.html#w">daughters</a> became mothers of 
        prominent Albany families across the eighteenth century. 
<p>By <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, the Waldron named had dropped 
        from city rolls.
