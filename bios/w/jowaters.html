<P>Like at least two same-named but not necessarily related predecessors, <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Waters</strong></a> was an Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">resident</a> during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a> of the American Revolution. We believe that he is not the older <a href="jowaters6826.html">John Waters</a> who died in 1786.

<p>In March <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;q1=certain%20waters;rgn=full%20text;idno=ABP1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000721">1777</a>, "a certain Waters" rented a house then occupied by <a href="../s/phschuyler1751.html">Coll. Philip P.  Schuyler</a> and intended to move his family there and inoculate them against smallpox. The Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> forbade the inoculation to safeguard the troops camped nearby. That individual may have been the subject of this sketch.

<p>In 1768 and afterwards, a John Waters was paid for services by the Albany government. We are not certain how many of the entries relate to this individual. In July 1778, probably this John Waters was <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting01paltrich#page/178/mode/2up">branded</a> a dangerous person, apprehended, posted bail and was ordered to stay within the city limits by the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jw">1779</a>, his first ward holdings were assessed under the partnership of "William __dren" and John Waters.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#jw">1781</a>, he was among the non native inhabitants who purchased the "freedom" or right to do business in the city. At that time he was identified as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html">merchant</a>.

<p>We believe this Albany resident was the John Waters who married Albany native Dorothea <a href="../vb/vbt.html">V</a>an Benthuysen at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in April 1781. However, no children appear to have been christened in the family church.

<p>Under suspicion during the war, perhaps it was his marriage into a mainline Albany family that led him to be included on a list of those who later were accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#jw">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jw">1788</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house and holdings were assessed modestly. In <a href="../../census1790.html#jw">1790</a>, his houshold (consisting only of a man and woman) was configured on the first federal census. Nearby, was the much larger <a href="../../census1790.html#506">household</a> of his widowed mother-in-law.

<p>John Waters was buried from the Albany Dutch church in December 1796. We believe he came to Albany during the mid-17770s, engaged in business, and died in 1796. However, important <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> remain regarding the life of this "<a href="../../or/or-nw.html">Other</a>" revolutionary.</p>
