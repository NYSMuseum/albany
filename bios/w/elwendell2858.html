<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Wendell</strong></a> was born in November 1724. She was the daughter of <a href="evwendell2657.html">Evert</a> and <a href="../l/englansing3243.html">Engeltie Lansing</a> Wendell. She grew up a middle child in the large family of a prominent Albany, businessman, attorney, and regional landholder. She was the sister of Albany mainstays Abraham E. <a href="../../loc/wendellmills.html">and</a> Philip Wendell.

<p>In July 1749, she was identified as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2657.html">will</a> filed by her affluent father. She was named to share with her four siblings his substantial Albany pastures and other properties as well.

<p>In January 1760, she married <a href="../s/bastaats4564.html">Barent Staats</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. At that time, the thirty-five year old Albany native was identified as a "spinster." Her new husband was in his early twenties. Perhaps the marriage produced only a daughter who was acknowledged in 1782. In 1770, she took over the Dutch church pew formerly held by her recently deceased mother.

<p>The newlyweds appear to have made their home with his parents in Albany's first ward along with two of Barent's brothers. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4564">1779</a>, Barent still was a resident in the State Street home of his widowed mother.

<p>Barent Staats called himself a resident of Rensselaerswyck when he wrote his will in <a href="../../wills/willbastaats4564.html">1782</a>. Elizabeth and married daughter Molly were named as heirs. Elizabeth and her brothers were named as executors. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4564">1790</a>, these Staates were counted with the residents of Watervliet . Barent I. Staats died in September 1794.
