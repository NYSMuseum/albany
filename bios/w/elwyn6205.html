<strong>Elizabeth Wyngaert</strong></a> was born in August 1726. She was the first child born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="jowyn6217.html">Johannes</a> and Maria Huysen Wyngaert. She grew up a member of a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a middling cooper.

<p>In January 1747, she married newcomer <a href="../d/jodavid7772.html">John David</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1772, eleven children had been christened at the church where both parents were members and pewholders. However, in 1772, the "wife of Mr. Davies" was noted among the new communicants at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. Through the 1770s, Elizabeth David and her husband were occasional baptism sponsors at the Dutch church.

<p>These David<a href="../../res/sp.html">s</a> raised their large family in Albany's first ward where John operated a store and also sold liquors. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7772">1790</a>, their modest <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside home included only four members.

<p>John David died in June 1794 leaving sixty-eight-year-old Elizabeth a widow. By <a href="../../census1800.html#6205">1800</a>, she had moved her home up the hill to <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion</a> Street along the Schenctady road. At that time, her household also included six young people.

<p>Her property on Lion Street was valued on the second ward assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>. Thus, she may have been the "Widow Davis" whose home at 126 Lion was listed in the first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%22davis+lion%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22davis+%20lion%22&f=false">1813</a>. Elizabeth Wyngaert David was dead by August 1813 when her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate.</p>
