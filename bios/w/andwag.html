<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referenced <a Href="#var">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Andrew Waggoner</strong></a> was listed on the census as the head of an Albany household in <a href="../../census1790.html#anwa">1790</a>. At that time, his second ward home included a man, a boy, and two unspecified females. His was one of six similarly sounding surnames shown on that census in Albany and Watervliet.  We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In 1792, <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lu</a>theran Church records noted that Andrew Wagoner rented a house near Lodge and Pine Streets. In 1790, his census listing fixed his residence west of Pearl Street. However, his name does not seem to appear in available church records.
 
<p>After that, the name Andrew Waggoner has not been encountered in the community based record. An extensive sweep of online resources in early 2018 has not produced additional references. However, a number of similarly named contemporaries appear to be <a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS765US765&biw=1568&bih=750&ei=LgqMWu68EsOUzwLo-LfwCQ&q=%22andrew+waggoner%22+albany+ny&oq=%22andrew+waggoner%22+albany+ny&gs_l=psy-ab.3...0.0.0.9269.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1c..64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.D67GrtkJWf4">at risk</a> in the early Republic. So, with significant basic questions still unanswered, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of this one-time Albany resident. </p>
