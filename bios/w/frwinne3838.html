<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Frans Winne</strong></a> was born in September 
        1734. He was the son of <a href="kiwinne2989.html">Kiliaen Winne</a> and 
        his second wife, <a href="../f/refonda3839.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Winne. 
        He grew up as part of a large family in a carpenter's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. He sometimes was known as "Frans Winne. Jr." to help avoid confusion 
        with at least two same-named contemporaries. 
<p>In December 1758, he married regional resident <a href="../v/anviele.html">Anna Viele</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. By 1779, nine children had been christened in Albany where 
        he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>He appears to have <a href="../../census1756.html#53">followed</a> his 
        father in the <a href="../../trades/wood.html">wood trades</a> and occasionally 
        was compensated by the city government for repair work on Albany buildings. 
<p>During the 1760s and <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3838">70s</a>, his real property was valued on the city assessment rolls. He also may have held an additional lot in the <a href="../../loc/wout.html">Woutenbergh</a>. In 1781, he may have been the Frans who petitioned the council for land at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Tynonderoga</a>.

<p>In his early forties during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, he was called on to provide carpentry for the revolutionary cause. In August <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#3838">1778</a>, his name appeared alongside that of his brother on a roster of artifacers serving the Quartermaster General out of Albany. In 1779, he signed a community-based petition on behalf of his neighbor, <a href="../t/jotillman.html">John Tillman</a>. Afterwards, Frans Winne, Jr. was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3838">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>The name of Frans Winne, Jr. does not seem to appear in the community records after the war. Perhaps, he died in Saratoga in <a href="http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/7522043/person/-1078961895">1797</a>. With outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on his subsequent life and passing, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
