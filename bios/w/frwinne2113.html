          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Frans Winne</B></A> was born about 1659. 
            He was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="piwinne8568.html">Pieter 
            Winne</a> and <a href="../a/adamswinne.html">Tanneke Adams</a> Winne.</P>

          <P>Frans grew up in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
            and Albany - learning the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> 
            and also the duties and potentials of landholding in support of his 
            father's <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> enterprises. 
            In December 1674, he was <a href="#apprentice">apprenticed</a> to 
            <a href="../a/ruta7101.html">Rutger Arentsen</a> to learn the shoemaker's trade for a term of four 
            years - or until he was nineteen.</P>

<p>As a younger son of a large family, Frans then was left to pursue his own destiny and joined a group of Albany merchants who posted a bond to trade in the Indian country in the Fall of <a href="#bond">1686</a>. This adventurous undertaking helped establish him in the new city of Albany.</p>

    
<p>In 1689, he married young <a href="../g/elsgansevoort4654.html">Elsie Gansevoort</a>. Between 1690 and 1707, their eight children were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch             church</a> where both parents were members and regular baptism sponsors.

<p>By the mid-1690s, these Winnes had emerged as <a href="../../census1697.html#064">Albany mainstays</a>. As his older brothers no longer were living in the new <a href="../../earlycity.html">city</a>, Frans became head of the Albany Winne family - acting as family executor and as <a href="#guardian">guardian</a> for the children of deceased siblings. His third ward home was an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2113">landmark</a>.</p>

<p>In 1702, the now successful merchant was elected assistant alderman for the third ward. He served until 1706 when he was elected alderman - serving until 1708. After that, he maintained his ties to city hall as a contractor and firemaster.</p>

          <p>By 1720, Frans Winne had passed on and his son, <a href="piwinne3032.html">Pieter</a>, 
            already had succeeded him.
