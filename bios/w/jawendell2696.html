<strong>Jacob Wendell</strong></a> was born in August 1691. He was the last child born to the second marrige of <a href="jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a> to physician's daughter <a href="../s/elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats</a>. His father died early in 1692 - leaving Elsje to raise their large family until she re-married in 1695 and subsequently gave birth to several more children. He grew up in their <a href="../../census1697.html#003">landmark home</a> on State Street.

<p>In 1691, he was <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">named</a> among the many heirs to her father's substantial estate.

<p>At a young age, Jacob was sent to New York to learn business. His Manhattan mentor soon shipped him to Boston merchant John Mico where he quickly found success on his own.

<p>In August 1714, he married physician's daughter Sarah Oliver of Cambridge at Mico's townhouse. The marriage is said to have produced twelve children - although none of  them were christened in Albany. However, between 1716 and the mid-1720s, he witnessed a number of baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>Over the next three decades, he rose in Boston business and political circles to become wealthy and powerful. Other members of the Albany <a href="../w/wendell.html">Wendell family</a> came to Boston to work under him. He was called "Colonel." He also was a notable <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=M5QEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22jacob+wendell%22&source=web&ots=WOTAHb-mxW&sig=hDBNhldco3cescnzBsH30s_UNWo#PPA70,M1">developer</a> of New England frontier lands. Among his partners in these real estate ventures  was childhood cohort <a href="../l/phlivingston86.html">Philip Livingston</a>.

<p>Banker, businessman, Council member, militia officer, and landholder, Albany native Jacob Wendell achieved unparalled distinction in New England. He died on September 7, 1761.  Jurist Oliver Wendell Holmes was his great-grandson.
