<P>According to provincial military <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ULAFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA448&lpg=PA448&dq=winterscale+albany&source=bl&ots=aDUquaV3nl&sig=yYVxrbWUVdGfYdYUEabS8yxj_Uc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-orGU5a2GJTdoASDzoKwBw&ved=0CEsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=winterscale%20albany&f=false">rec</a>ords, <a href="#sources"><b>Barnabus Winterscale</b></a> was born in Ireland about 1729. In 1762, he was a thirty-five-year-old soldier in a regiment of New York provincial troops. He was described as 5' 8" tall, with red hair, blue eyes, and a fair and freckled complexion. That <a href="../../sources.html#sh">source</a> also identified him as a weaver and/or laborer. </p>

<p>His name appears in the record under a <a href="../../res/sp.html">variety of spellings</a>. He lived in Albany during the 1760s and 70s. His modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> appeared on city assessment rolls in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6926">1779</a>. He resided in the same <a href="../../loc/southside.html">neighborhood</a> where former soldiers (and <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">weavers</a> as well) had lived for many decades.

<p>He was married to a woman named Elizabeth. In 1768, his family of three <a href="../../coerec1771.html#6926">belonged</a> to <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. A list of St. Peter's communicants for <a href="../../coerec1771.html">1771</a> identified and "Barnaley" and family as members.</p>

<p>He may have been the same "Baraby Winterscale" who <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> as an enlisted man in Colonel Marinus Willett's regiment of levies during the American Revolution. A subsequent pension <a href="http://www.fold3.com/page/630297180_barnaby_winterscale/">app</a>lication for that individual has not yet been researched.

<p>After 1779, his name no longer appeared in the community-based record. We <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">seek</a> information on his later life and passing. This one time Albany resident was among the many <a href="../../newcomers.html">new</a>comers of <a a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> background who were associated with the military.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Barnabus/Barney/Barnaley/Barnet Winterscale is CAP <a href="../../../db.html">biography number</a> 6926. This baseline sketch is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. At this point, we hold only sketchy material on him and seek defining information on his background and fate. We understand that this biographical offering is premature!</font size></p>
