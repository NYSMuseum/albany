      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Wendell</b></a> was born in April 1738. She 
        was the only child of the short-lived marriage of <a href="abewendell2737.html">Abraham</a> 
        and <a href="../b/geerbleecker170.html">Geertruy Bleecker</a> Wendell. 
        Her mother soon died and her father may have remarried before his death 
        in 1753.</p>


<p>In 1761, she was called a spinster at the time of her marriage to Albany merchant <a href="../h/thjhun4781.html">Thomas Hun</a>. Possibly because both partners were several years older than the <a href="../../marriages.html">norm</a>, the marriage appears to have produced just two children who were born during the 1760s. </p>

<p>These Huns lived in the heart of the <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a> business district in a large house built by her husband after the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>.

<p>Thomas J. Hun named his wife and children as heirs in his will filed in 1800. Her husband died in 1802. Elizabeth Wendell Hun died in April 1810 at the age of seventy-two. Her son and <a href="../h/anhun4771.html">daughter</a> became prominent Albany residents.</p>
