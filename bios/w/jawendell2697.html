<strong>Jacob Wendell</strong></a> was born in November 1702. He was the first son born to the marriage of Albany mainstays <a href="hawendell2667.html">Harmanus</a> and <a href="../g/anglen4917.html">Anna Glen</a> Wendell. He grew up in a comfortable home on upper <a href="../../streets.html">State Street</a>.


<p>In December 1728, he married <a href="../vr/helvr5081.html">Helena Van Rensselaer</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1745, eight children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>As early as 1723, he was named on a list of Albany <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchants</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1744">1744</a>, he was elected alderman.

<p>He also had inherited land at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, in the Mohawk Valley, and on the eastern side of the Hudson.  


<p>Months from his forty-third birthday, Jacob Wendell died in September 1745 and was buried in Greenbush alongside his wife's family. His widow survived until 1792.</p>
