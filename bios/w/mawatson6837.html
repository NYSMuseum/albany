<strong>Matthew Watson</strong></a> lived in Albany from the 1760s to the 1790s. He probably was born about 1740.

<p>He first appeared in the community record in 1766 when he joined a number of Albany men in signing a <a href="../../solconst.html#6837">constitution</a> for the Albany Sons of Liberty. In that year, his name began to appear on assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> where he was called "Mr. Watson," a tailor, and a resident and householder in the first and then second <a href="../../wards.html">wards</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6837">1788</a>, his second ward house and property were accorded modest assessments. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6837">1790</a>, his household included two men, two boys, two females, and a slave.

<p>He was known as a tailor, a merchant, and an agent for Manhattan merchants. He advertized in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> both before and after the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. He lived at #20 <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a>.

<p>He was a member, trustee, and elder of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. In 1771, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#6837">Masonic Lodge</a>.

<p>He served in the colonial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the first ward. Later, he cut wood on Albany lands and was paid for services by the city government.

<p>In 1775, he pledged money for the relief of Ticonderoga. As a newcomer merchant, he would be <a href="../../cddc.html">watched</a> by the revolutionaries. He was permitted to post bond for a number of individuals. Otherwise, we have not yet connected him to wartime activities.

<p>At the end of the war, he was serving as one of the "Commissioners of Forfeitures" for the western district - a position of judgment and trust. Afterwards, he was able to secure the rights to a number of bounty <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lands</a> as well. 
  
<p>After 1790, the name of name Matthew Watson dropped from Albany rolls. He was dead by May 1797 when letters of administration on the "estate of Matthew Watson" were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dhAXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA251&dq=francis+follet">granted</a> to his son William and to <a href="../f/frfoll.html">Francis Follet</a>, a friend.</p>
