<strong>Harmanus Wendell</strong></a> was born in June 1742. He was born a few months after the marriage of <a href="hawendell2669.html">Harmanus</a> and <a href="../vv/cavvechten2398.html">Catharina Van Vechten</a> Wendell - the eldest of their nine children. Young Harmanus grew up in prominent merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. In 1769, he was <a href="../../wills/willhawendell2669.html">listed</a> among the children and heirs of his father. But, unlike his younger siblings, he already had extensive accounts with Harmanus Wendell - the elder.

<p>He married Catharina Van Rensselaer. Between 1768 and 1777 their four children had been christened at the Schenectady Dutch church.

<p>These Wendells lived in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where Harmanus engaged in business, paid substantial taxes, and managed his family's property. In 1764, he was recommended for a lieutentancy in a Schenectady <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.  

<p>However, Harmanus Wendell was dead by the time their last daughter was baptized in March 1777. He had not lived thirty-five years!</p>
