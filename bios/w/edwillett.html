      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Edward Willett</strong></a> was born in April 
        1731. He was the son of Edward and Aletta Clowes <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jNcUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=%22edward+willett%22&source=bl&ots=4FzF0FLjxA&sig=KgJ7A7ISfDlUGfwVqCAO2LgLyN8&hl=en&ei=4zSMS62zNceV8Ab-mdHEDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAw#">Willett</a>. 
        His father is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been a Quaker 
        farmer, teacher, and tavernkeeper on Long Island. He also was called "Edward 
        Willetts, Jr." Albany resident <a href="elwillett6906.html">Elbert</a> 
        and the distinguished <a href="http://www.nyhistory.net/~drums/willett.htm">Marinus</a> 
        Willett were his younger brothers. His younger kinsman, skipper <a href="edwillett6905.html">Edward S. Willett</a>, was an Albany mainstay and contemporary.
      <p>He probably was not the same-named <a href="http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Manhattan/Broadway/Wall.Commons.html">individual</a> 
        who operated a tavern in Manhattan in 1754. Instead or perhaps additionally, he was a 
        schoolteacher and was employed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USPG">SPG</a>. In <a href="../irish.html#1772">1772</a>, he was identified as a schoolmaster in Albany and as  someone who offered "good Private lodgings" for newcomer Scots.

<p>In April 1752, perhaps this Edward Willett married Elizabeth Bodine of Lebanon, New Jersey. That marriage does not appear to have produced children. In August 1762, he married Mary Gale. By 1775, five children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The last son was baptized six months after the father's death.
	   
<p>The Willetts were members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> 
        Anglican church. Edward's name was on a list of <a href="../../coerec1771.html#ew">communicants</a> 
        dated December 1771. 
      <p>During the mid-1760s, a "Willet" appeared on the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. With no first name given, we suspect that Edward Willett was 
        that individual with a minimal assessment for property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>According to family-based materials, Edward Willett died in Albany in 
        September 1774. He was buried from St. Peter's. Thus, his widow may well 
        could have been the "Widow Willet" whose third ward property was valued 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#widwil">1779</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#widwil">1788</a>. 
        However, information for Edward Willett of Albany has been found for times after his supposed burial date.</p>

        <dd>Because so many same-named individuals are at risk during this Albany resident's lifetime, an uncomfortable uncertainty accompanies this sketch.<p></p>
