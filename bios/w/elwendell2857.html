<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Wendell</b></a> was born in June 1723. She was the second daughter born into the large family of Albany natives <a href="iswendell2694.html">Isaac</a> and Catalina Van Dyck Wendell.</p>


<p>About 1745, she married Albany merchant and landholder <a href="../l/pelansing3642.html">Peter Lansing</a>. By 1758, their six children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were occasional baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Lansings lived in Albany's first ward during a long marriage that lasted thru the end of the eighteenth century. By that time, they had moved their residence to 
<a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> where Peter, Elizabeth, a younger woman, and five slaves were listed on the census in 1800.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Wendell Lansing died in October 1801 and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Dutch church cemetery plot. Peter Lansing lived until 1807.</p>
