<P><a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Thomase Witbeck</strong></a> is the patriarch of the <a href="witbeck.html">Witbeck</a> family of Albany and greater Albany County.
 
<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="#sources">sources</a>, Jan Thomase Witbeck was born in "Witbeck," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holstein">Holstein</a> in what later became Germany. Suggested birth dates <a href="../../res/origins.html">seem</a> to range from 1604 to 1630.

<p>He is said to have been in New Netherland by 1644. In 1646, he was identified as the servant and also the former servant of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> officials. In 1649 and/or 1653, he was among those colonists who signed an oath of allegiance to the <a href="../vr/vr.html">P</a>atroon.

<p>Perhaps by mid-century, he had married <a href="../d/geerdoch.html">Geertruy Andr. Dochter</a>, the mother of at least seven children and the matriarch of the Albany Witbeck family. 

<p>Jan Thomase is said to have been present at the initial distribution of Beverwyck <a href="../../lists/list1650s.html">houselots</a> in 1652-53.

<p>Also in 1653, the <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">court minutes</a> include a letter from his father "Thomas Jensen" of "Witbeck" (presumably his home town).

<p>In 1655, he is said to have had a house nicknamed "The Cuckoo's Nest." We surmise that his property was within the court's jurisdiction.

<p>More than <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">one</a> traditional <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">favorite</a> has referred to him as a "most considerable [<a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a>] trader in Beverwyck." Also, his name seems to have been prominent on the petition submitted by the community's major <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a> in <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">1660</a>.

<p>Perhaps he leased a farm (or part of one) on <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&tbs=rcnt%3A1&q=site%3Awww.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+papsknee&aq=f&oq=&aqi=#hl=en&safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+papsknee&oq=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+papsknee&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=serp.3...1487.4501.0.4645.9.9.0.0.0.0.80.640.9.9.0...0.0.r2y4npgo-rM&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=24cf5cb42d7b81b2&biw=1583&bih=582">Paps c/k anee Island</a> in 1658. About that time, he is said to have held land at Esopus as well.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#carry">1674</a>, his name appeared on a list of those who were to carry the body of the deceased <a href="../vr/jevr.html">director</a> of the colony.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>, his name appears to have been absent from a census of Albany householders.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#1820">1683</a>, his name was included on a list of those who contributed to the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. His pledge/contribution appears to have read "0."

<p>Jan Thomase Witbeck is said to have died in Albany in 1684. Admittedly, much of our so-called understanding of the life of this community pioneer has been taken from <a href="../../res/ts.html">traditional sources</a>.</p>
