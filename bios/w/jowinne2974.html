<P>This <a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes Winne</strong></a> probably was born in October 1707. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents <a href="dawinne.html">Daniel</a> and <a href="../vn/divness895.html">Dirckie Van Ness</a> Winne. He grew up as the third of seven surviving sons in a <a href="http://www.eancestry.org/getperson.php?personID=I11650&tree=nichols">large family</a> on his father's farm. He was known as "Jan Winne."

<p>In January 1726, he married Albany native <a href="../vp/ravplanck1167.html">Rachel Verplanck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1728, three children had been christened in the Albany church.

<p>These Winnes settled in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Jan purchased a lot at the foot of <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> in 1729 and added to it two years later.

<p>At this point, conflicting <a href="../qqqq.html">information</a> regarding his life (also marriage and passing) dictate cautious navigation of the next two decades. In August <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/chburmen.html">1733</a>, a "Jan Winne" was said to have been buried in the Dutch churchyard. In March <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+rachel+winne&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22annals%20of%20albany%22%20rachel%209&f=false">1736</a>, Rachel Winne "a wedow" received consideration for monies owed the city council. Her brother <a href="../vp/guvplanck1119.html">Gulleyn Verplanck</a> was referenced in the transaction as well. Thus, Jan seems to have passed on! However, he is not the only <a href="../../res/sp.html">Jo</a>hannes Winne at risk for the second quarter of the eighteenth century and subsequent community-based refernces point to this particular individual.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1741">1741</a>, a "Jan Winne" was chosen firemaster for the third ward. However, the name was not among those listed as Albany freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>.

<p>In January 1751, along with his brothers, Pieter and <a href="kiwinne2989.html">Killyan</a>, "Jan Winne" was named co-executor in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA482&lpg=PA482&dq=%22winne,+daniel%22+%22rensselaerswyck+manor%22&source=bl&ots=4RFm2zlQ1M&sig=Fiz1wHh-_TR2jBv5FJTWUQ5Of8Y&hl=en&ei=66fjTbKYAeLL0QH_tbGfBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22winne%2C%20daniel%22%20%22rensselaerswyck%20manor%22&f=false">will</a> filed by his father.

<p>In 1752, Jan Winne was among those who obtained part of the <a href="../../na/hoos.html">Hoosick Patent</a> from his parents. In 1770, more "Van Ness land" land was added to his holdings in the area ten miles above Albany.

<p>After that, his story is even <a href="../qqqq.html">less certain</a> as a same-named future Albany resident was <a href="jowinne2983.html">born</a> in 1735.
