<strong>Evert J. Wendell</strong></a> was born in March 1725. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="jowendell2955.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../k/ankip5944.html">Anna Kip</a> Wendell. He grew up in a businessman's home in the second ward but lost his father in 1739.

<p>Perhaps this Evert Wendell did not marry as no baptisms of his children or sponsorships were found in the records of Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>It appears that he was a frontier <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a>. His Albany home was in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#79">1756</a>, he was identified as a merchant. He was elected assistant alderman in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1749">1749</a> and 1750. In that year, he agreed to help with a survey of the city's boundaries and  may have served in other capactities as well. 

<p>Evert J. Wendell filed a <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2663.html">will</a> in May 1763. At that time, he was "in perfect health." The will named his mother as executor but mentioned no children. He is <a href="../../sources.html#nycd">said</a> to have been killed on June 2, 1763 at the Chippweays "house"  near Toronto - "shot" during some "trading gone bad." The will passed probate in October 1764.</p>
