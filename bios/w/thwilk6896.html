<strong>Thomas Wilkinson</strong></a> was born in October 1775. He was the son of <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> residents John and Anna Marshall Wilkinson.

<p>In October 1802, he was almost twenty-eight when he married <a href="../h/anhilton406.html">Ann Hilton</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Subsequently, the marriage produced a number of children.

<p>In the years that followed, he acquired a number of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lots</a> along what became <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl</a> Street in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of Albany.

 <p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, his houses and lots on Maiden Lane and <a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay</a> Street were valued on the third ward assessment roll. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, his budding household was configured on the Albany census.
 
<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22wilkinson+thomas&source=bl&ots=2hLxOZXx9A&sig=1u1u_V4JYutjq_trCGqkeuehJ04&hl=en&ei=JzFfSpOOH46itgfMkZzgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4">1813</a>, his <a href="../../econ/comec.html#grocer">grocery</a> at 1 Maiden Lane (riverside) and later at 195 South Pearl Street were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories.</a>

<p>Thomas Wilkinson appears to have passed on early in 1829. In March 1829, letters of administration were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">issued</a> on his estate. In 1830, his widow was listed in the city directory as living on Schuyler Street.</p>
