<strong>Jacob Winne</strong></a> was born in February 1760. He was an older son in the large family of <a href="jewinne2965.html">Jellis</a> and <a href="../vw/fyvwoert2514.html">Feytie Van Woert</a> Winne. He grew up in the Market Street home of <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> mainstays who anchored Jacob's family network into the 1800s.

<p>Coming of age during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, we seek information on his wartime activities. 

<p>His <a href="http://www.eancestry.org/getperson.php?personID=I11089&tree=nichols">wife</a> was Susanna Everts (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Hoghson). Between 1778 and 1792, three children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he contributed to church operations. In 1795 and December <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/helderb07.htm">1798</a>, sons were christened at the Heldebergh Dutch church in Guilderland.  Their father was called "Jacob Winne, Esq." 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2958">1788</a>, his house and lot were valued on the third ward census. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2958">1790</a>, his second ward household included five males and a female.

<p>By 1800, his name no longer appeared on Albany rolls although his father's household still was <a href="../../census1800.html#2965">configured</a> on the city census.

<p>A <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079_ls.htm">map</a> of lots in the West Manor was made by a "Jacob Winne" in 1789.  

<p>A Jacob Winne was <a href="http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/winne-winship.html#1LP18LX66">elected</a> to the New York State <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=73JIAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA432&lpg=RA3-PA432&dq=%22jacob+winne%22&source=bl&ots=E-DvxDU-IG&sig=E5rtSZ1DqRdF9pDIb2yCyE5qwIg&hl=en&ei=g0hlS4i1O8bS8AawmdGgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=%22jacob%20winne%22&f=false">Assembly</a> from Albany County and served 1799-1801. More than one Jacob Winne was <a href="http://www.morrisonspensions.org/howard.html">active</a> in the region during the last quarter of the century.

<p>Perhaps this Jacob Winne died or had left the city. His <a href="jewinne2790.html">son</a> became a prominent third ward resident. Perhaps his widow, Susanna Winne, <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/cemeteries/luckhurst.html">died</a> at Schenectady in 1840 at the age of eighty.
