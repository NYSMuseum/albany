<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit Witbeck</strong></a> was born in March 1750. He was a twin and the eldest son of Albany-<a href="../../na/na.html">area</a> residents Lucas and Geertruy Lansing Witbeck. Although his father held several parcels of real estate, the twins and their siblings grew up on a farm in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. As late as <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">1792</a>, father and sons were involved in Watervliet-based land transactions. 

<p>In May 1774, Gerrit married <a href="../../res/sp.html">I</a>mmetje Perry at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, they were identified as young people "of this county." By 1781, three children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In May 1775, his name first appeared in the minutes of the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany committee</a>. He supported the cause and was paid for making spades and nails for revolutionary army. 

<p>In November 1777, he was appointed chimney viewer for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In July 1778, the city council received a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA286&lpg=PA286&dq=%22gerrit+witbeck%22+middle+dock&source=bl&ots=wwkCeTt9ez&sig=gS6NqG6O8J_j8OhCtihpzr2Q90Y&hl=en&ei=ZNG9S8XhAoW0lQeiqp2RBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22gerrit%20witbeck%22%20middle%20dock&f=false">complaint</a> that his blacksmith's shop located on the middle dock obstructs the filling up of the dock inlet. He was ordered to remove that shop.

<p>Either by inheritance or acquisition, by <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1791">1779</a> this <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith</a> was paying taxes on four properties in the city of Albany. These included his house, lots located in the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1791l">first</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1791l3">third</a> wards, and his <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1791s">shop</a> near the river.

<p>In January 1787, the <a href="../../ag.html">news</a>paper noted that he had opened a nail manufactory "in" Orange Street near the Dutch church. The  assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1791">1788</a> valued his third ward house and property and also noted "Mr. Anderson (nailer)" living on the premises.

<p>On August 8, 1788, he <a href="../../doc/albanychronicles.html#08081788">carried</a> the farmer's flag in the Albany parade celebrating ratification of the Federal Consititution.
 
<p><a href="../../census1790.html#1791">1790</a>, his household in Watervliet included seven family members, another free person, and also four slaves. Perhaps he had relocated to a family <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA932&lpg=PA932&dq=witbeck+watervliet&source=bl&ots=m0gVVzgFkW&sig=jn6CYD-n5YA7gzthdHwILs2MW-Y&hl=en&ei=JPG9S4OED8OBlAeb6dz4Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CAsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=witbeck%20watervliet&f=false">farm</a> leased by his father in 1769. Perhaps he was the Gerrit Witbeck who <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">leased</a> a 127-acre farm in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in 1794.

<p>A piece of legislation <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kOATAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA544&lpg=PA544&dq=%22garret+witbeck%22&source=bl&ots=SUyHrcmsR0&sig=nDxYOdnTM9MTkvFfa6GxWYh2K_c&hl=en&ei=wO69S-ieFcL_lgecqezmBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CBgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22garret%20witbeck%22&f=false">enacted</a> in April 1800, noted that <a href="../../res/sp.html">G</a>arret Witbeck was one of the "Superintendants of Highways" for Albany County. He also was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#1791">Masonic lodge</a>.

<p>We seek defining information on his later life and passing.</p>
