<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Evert Janse</strong></a> was born about 1615. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources state that he was a native of Embden in East Friesland. He emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> - first to New Amsterdam and then upriver to <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> to <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a> with the Indians.

<p>He was living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> at the initial distribution of <a href="../../lists/list1650s.html">houselots</a> in 1653. He soon began to acquire and trade additional parcels of land within the Albany stockade.

<p> His first wife was <a href="../t/sustruax.html">Susanna Truax</a> whom he married in New Amsterdam in July 1644. After her death, Evert Janse is said to have wed the widow <a href="../vd/mavdu5552.html">Maritie Mingael</a> in 1663. He was a lifelong member and officer of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>.

<p>His marriages produced many children with ambitious sons to establish the <a href="../w/wendell.html">Wendell family</a> in Albany, its environs, and beyond for many generations.

<p>Evert Janse was a trader and official in Albany throughout the second half of the seventeenth century. His State Street <a href="../../census1679.html#2655">home</a> was prominently configured on community <a href="../../census1697.html#096">survey documents</a>. He was a church officer and involved in its business. His primary accomplishment seems to have been the ability to garner a number of <a href="../../loc/wendellmills.html">choice parcels</a> of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> in the new city of Albany. His family further developed them in the years that followed.
  
<p>Evert Janse Wendell may have lived into his mid-nineties. In August 1703, he and Maria (his wife) conveyed a parcel of land in Albany to his son <a href="thwendell2729.html">Thomas Wendell</a>. <a href"../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources hold that he died in 1709 at the age of ninety-seven. In that year, his widow and Thomas were listed on the Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2729">assessment roll</a>.
