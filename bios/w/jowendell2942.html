            <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Johannes Wendell</B></A> was <a href="#born">born</a> 
              in New Netherland in 1649. He was the son of <a href="evwendell2655.html">Evert 
              Janse</a> and his first wife, <a href="../t/sustruax.html">Susanna 
              Truax</a> Wendell. At the time of his father's second marriage in 
              1663, he was identified as aged fourteen and the eldest of five 
              surviving children.</P>
            <P>Shortly thereafter, he entered the fur trade. By the 1670s, he 
              had married Maria de Meyer - daughter of a Manhattan-based merchant 
              and would-be Albany trader. That union was shortlived and her death 
              left him with two small daughters. By the end of the decade, Johannes 
              had remarried - this time to <a href="../s/elsstaats99.html">Elsie 
              Staats</a>, daughter of a prominent Albany physician. Over the next 
              twelve years, she bore him nine more children - making their household 
              among Albany's largest.</P>
            <p>Johannes Wendell prospered in the fur trade, established a <a href="../../census1679.html#jowendell">home</a> 
              on upper State Street, acquired <a href="#lands">frontier lands</a>, 
              was appointed justice of the peace in 1684, commissioned captain 
              of the Albany militia company in 1685, and was appointed alderman 
              under the Albany <a href="../../charter.html">city charter</a> of 
              1686. He also was a deacon and elder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
              church</a>.</P>
            <p>He served as <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> alderman 
              until the charter government was suspended during the reign of <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob 
              Leisler</a>. Unlike the other <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city 
              fathers</a>, he did not repudiate Leisler's regime. Instead, he 
              accepted Leisler's commission to be <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
              of Albany in 1690. With the return of regular government in 1691, 
              Johannes Wendell found himself cut off from <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">city 
              hall</a>. He also began to experience trouble in his business when 
              he was brought before the Albany court and fined for illegal trading 
              with the Indians.</p>
            <p>In November 1691, this fifty-one-year-old merchant and landholder 
              made his <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">will</a>. 
              He died early in 1692 leaving a widow and eleven children to share 
              in his extensive estate.</p>
