<P> <a href="#sources"><strong>Thomas Winne</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Tomas) probably was born before 1670. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="piwinne8568.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../a/adamswinne.html">Tannetje Adams</a> Winne. He grew up a middle child in a very large family on his father's extensive holdings mostly located <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">south</a> of what became the city of Albany.

<p>In 1683 and afterward, he was counted among the members of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. In 1687, he also was admitted to the Dutch church in New York City.

<p>In July 1684, he was among the thirteen children named in the joint <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne8568.html">will</a> filed by his parents. His father died first. In 1693, his mother remarried. She was dead by 1697 and "Tomas" was among the many remaining heirs who then would share in the Winne estate.

<p>In October 1689, he married one "<a href="../g/tegoes.html">Teuntje Jans Goes</a>" at the Albany church. At the time, both partners were living "near Albany." By 1696, four children had been christened in Albany. <a href="http://www.ancestraltrackers.org/ny/resources/new-york-genealogical-biographical-record-v13.pdf">Per</a>haps, another child was christened in New York in 1699. Tomas Winne was an occasional         baptism sponsor in Albany during the 1690s.

<p>In June 1699, he was among the twenty-eight non natives who were <a href="../../doc/cc/0627699.html">cited</a> by the Albany court because they did not possess the freedom of the city. Thus, they could not legally <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a> with the Indians. Earlier, in January <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3128">1699</a>, he was among those Albany County residents who pledged allegiance to the Protestant King of England.

<p>It appears that he was a would-be fur trader. However, his activities and actual residence has <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">thus far</a> eluded our most recent sweep of community-based resources. Perhaps his life was cut short before his overall economic profile would be more fully articulated.

<p>Thomas Winne was dead by October 1705 when Teuntje ("wid. of Thomas Winnen") remarried At that time, she was living at <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. She is said to have lived for more than two decades.  Thomas Winne, however, had         lived for less than forty-years.</p>
