<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Buckridge Webb</strong></a> lived in Albany during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. He is <a href="http://www.jenforum.com/webb/messages/17040.html">said</a> to have been born in Philadelphia and to have served in the French <a href="../../7yw.html">and</a> Indian War. 

<p>In February 1764, he was identified as one of the sergeants who were <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/calendarofnycolo00alba/calendarofnycolo00alba_djvu.txt">petitioning</a> for a share of lands allotted to "disbanded officers." In April, a survey was returned of a tract of 200 <a href="../../res/realestate.html">acres</a> in Albany County (Charlotte, Vermont) to be allotted to soldiers from the 60th Regiment.

<p>By <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rbillard/na_baptisms_1731-1800.htm">1770</a>, he had married Catherine Sees or Sweet at the Dutch church in New York City. At least three children were christened there prior to the oubreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. However, his name seems to be absent from the extant Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> records. However, he does not seem to have been <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA675&dq=%22webb%22&source=web&ots=W4zL6h-NDG&sig=jgYAaGL-vhXYjpAzBa2ydE2OjSg#v=onepage&q&f=false">much</a> of a presence in pre-war New York City.

<p>At some <a href="../qqqq.html">point</a> during the 1770s, he re-located to Albany.
 
<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6841">1779</a>, his house was valued moderately on the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> assessment roll. A decade later, his property and holdings were <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6841">assessed</a> in the first ward. 

<p>We seek information on his wartime activities. However, aftrerwards, he was accorded a  land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6841">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In October <a href="../../org/cc.html#1781">1781</a>, he was appointed constable for the second ward. However, a few days later he petitioned to be excused from serving due to his poverty and to being a refugee.


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6841">1788</a>, his first ward home and property received modest assessments. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6841">1790</a>, his  <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> household included four residents. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, only his scant personal property was valued on the first ward assessment roll. But in <a href="../../census1800.html#6841">1800</a>, he was listed as the head of city household in the same general location.

<p>After 1800, the name of Buckridge Webb has not been found in the community-based records or during our sweep of available <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a> resources. With <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> beginning with his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and about his life after 1800, at this time we move on from this onetime Albany resident. </p>
