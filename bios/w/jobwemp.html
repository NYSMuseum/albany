<strong>Jan Barentse Wemp</strong></a> was <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in Drenthe or Dodrecht in the Netherlands about 1620. He most likely emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> as a young man. 

<p>He was living in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> by 1643 when he was identified as the one-time servant of Cornelis Teunisz.

<p>In 1645-46, he is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been operating the Patroon's farm on the "Vlackte." The wages allowed for Wemp and his wife were 300 florins a year. However, he left the farm over some "trouble with the Indians." He worked other <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xWsq2NPeYRcC&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=%22jan+barentse+wemp%22&source=bl&ots=ocBZ3bNvrk&sig=dcivHvhv15LWAoxVRoAa8KB9hRM&hl=en&ei=u3KySs2SPIPSlAfv6YCBDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#v=onepage&q=%22jan%20barentse%20wemp%22&f=false">farms</a> and later ran sawmills on the creeks north and <a href="../../na/castle.html">south</a> of the settlement that later became Albany. In 1654, he took over a farm located across the river on the Poestenkil.

<p>His wife was Maria <a href="#mm">M</a>ynders. He probably married during the mid-1640s. The marriage produced at least six children. The eldest living child was fifteen in 1664.

<p>In 1652 <a href="../../books.html#jv">or</a> 1653, he began to hold land near the north end of the stockade that enclosed what soon would become the village of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. In 1658, he was among those who obtained a lot in Beverwyck. However, his name is not on either of the <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">lists</a> of fur traders considered by the Beverwyck magistrates in 1660.

<p>In November 1662, Governor Stuyvesant made Jan Barentse one of the first patentees to receive land at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> when he was <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/wemp_j.html">granted</a> the island called Van Slyck's or Wemp's Island. That 82-acre parcel was said to have been some of the "best land in the valley." He also held a lot in what became the village of Schenectady.

<p>Jan Barentse Wemp died during the spring of 1663. His widow re-married in 1664. Her second husband is said to have been the one-time farm hand of Jan Barentse Wemp. Wemp's five living children were named in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#v=onepage&q=2127&f=false">will</a> filed by his widow just before her re-marriage in June of that year. 

<p>This relatively short-lived <a href="../../nnd.html">p</a>ioneer settler who died in 1663 was the first of several individuals called "Jan Barentse Wemp" who lived in greater Albany County before the American Revolution. He probably was not an <a href="../../criteria.html">actual</a> resident of what became the city of Albany.</p>

The life of Jan Barentse Wemp  is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6862. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. He is one of the settlers described in <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">VRBM</a> - a seminal source for the history of Rensselaerswyck. Van Laer's sketch of Wemp appears on page 831.

<p><a name=mm></a><b>Mynders:</b> Maria probably was a member of the <a href="../vi/vi.html">Van Iveren</a> family.

<p>Se seek <u>evidence</u> that this Jan Barentse Wemp actually lived within what became the <a href="../../earlycity.html">city</a> of Albany. Who can help here?
