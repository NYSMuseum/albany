<strong>Johannes Wyngaert</strong></a> was born in May of 1703. He was the eldest son born to the marriage of <a href="jawyn6213.html">Jacob Luycasse</a> and <a href="../q/maq2204.html">Maria Quackenbush</a> Wyngaert. He grew up in a large family in a modest <a href="../../wards.html">third ward</a> home. His father died in 1727 leaving twenty-four-year-old Johannes as the man of the family.

<p>In November 1725, he married Maria "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Huyser</a>"  at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1738, eight children had been christened at the Albany church. 

<p>Johannes Wyngaert was a <a href="../../census1756.html#196">cooper</a> who raised his family in modest homes in the second and then first <a href="../../wards.html">wards</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1724">1724</a>, he was named constable for the second ward. At a number of times, he delivered firewood for city use and served on the night watch. In 1757, he owned a house on the south side of the <a href="../../loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a>. He was counted among Albany's freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6217">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6217">1763</a> and his holdings were valued modestly on city assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a>.

<p>Without younger Johannes Wyngaerts immediately apparent on the community landscape, this individual may have lived into the 1790s. Asessment rolls continued to value his holdings as late as <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6217">1788</a>. The census of <a href="../../census1790.html#6217">1790</a> for the first ward of Albany includes the household of "Johannes Wyngardt" in a likely location. 
<p>In September 1793 or '94, a notice for the pall and hearse for "John Wyngart" appeared in the manuscript burial <a href="../../guide/histres.html#death">records</a> of the Albany Dutch church. This Johannes Wyngaert would have been in his nineties at that time.</p>
