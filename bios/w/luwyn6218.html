<strong>Luykas Gerritse Wyngaert</strong></a> was an Albany mainstay during the last half of the seventeenth century. He was known as "Luykas Gerritse."</p>

<p>His wife was <a href="../vh/anvh748.html">Anna Van Hoesen</a> with whom he had at least nine children. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6218">1679</a>, his name was included on a census of Albany householders. In <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#inhabitants">1681</a>, he joined with other Albany burghers in a petition regarding the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. Over the years, he subscribed to several <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1681bl">similar</a>, community-based documents. 

<p>Nominally a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>, he probabaly used that talent to have tradeable commodities with which to barter for furs. After holding a number of service titles, he was <a href="../../corporation.html#offices"> elected</a> assistant alderman for the second ward - first in 1686. He sat on the city council for portions of three decades. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>,  his first ward home was valued on the city assessment roll. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#133">1697</a>, his Albany household included two other adult men in a community where most living units were nuclear.

<p>At the end of October in 1709, Luykas Gerritse Wyngaert filed a joint <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6218.html">will</a> with his wife. It named two sons and mentioned seven other children.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6218">1720</a>,  the name of Luykas Wyngaert appeared on a list of freeholders living in Albany's first ward. The name "Luycas Gerritse Wyngaert" was included on the list of first ward freeholders as late as <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6218">1742</a>. He then would have died sometime thereafter.</p>
