<p><a href ="../w/pwraxall.html">Wraxall, Peter</a> (?-11 July 1759), secretary of Indian affairs,
was born in Bristol, England, the son of John Wraxall, a merchant.
His mother's name is not known. No record of his early formal
education has been found. Although the Wraxall family were prominent
members of the local community, the economic fluctuations pertaining
to merchant endeavors encouraged young Peter to leave the area
in the hopes of achieving a greater degree of personal success
and prosperity. He apparently resided in the Netherlands for
a time, where he became familiar with the Dutch language. He
next visited Jamaica and finally settled in the royal province of New York.  

<p>As early as 1746, during King George's war in America, Wraxall's
name appears on the muster rolls of the colony, which include
the names of men from Long Island "ready and truly inlisted in
Peter Wraxall's Company of Foot for the present expedition to
Canada." The following year, returning to England on urgent private
business, he was entrusted with a letter from the colonial governor
to the under secretary at Whitehall. Wraxall was to gather information
on the state of relations between France and England in North
America as well as on transactions relating to civil and military
matters and political factionalism in the province of New York.
The confidence shown in Wraxall suggests that he was competent
and respected in colonial matters and was supported by powerful
political friends in the governor's circle. While still in England,
he received a royal commission dated 15 November 1750 to the
positions of secretary or agent for the government of New York
to the Indians and also as town clerk of the peace and clerk
of the common pleas in the county and city of Albany. When he
returned to New York, however, Wraxall discovered that through
either neglect or ignorance the governor had already appointed
someone town clerk. In spite of years of legal appeals, this
royal commission was never honored.  

<p>Wraxall was therefore constrained to content himself with the
wider duties of Indian secretary. This position was of significant
importance, however, as the last great struggle for empire in
North America between France and England was about to take place.
Pivotal to the success of both powers was the ability to court
and maintain the affections of the Six Nations Confederacy of
Iroquois, whose land acted as a barrier between New France and
the British colonies of New York and Pennsylvania, and "all other
Indians." With the Iroquois wavering in their loyalty to the
British, the factionalized American colonies, recognizing their
military weakness and lack of defense preparations, organized
a meeting at Albany in 1754. The "Albany Congress" resolved little,
but of vital importance was the introduction of Peter Wraxall
to William Johnson, one of the most powerful and influential
men in the royal province of New York. The two men shared a common
interest in Indian relations and a common distrust of the Albany
Indian Commissionaires, who were essentially a group of self-interested
merchants and traders.  

<p>That same year Wraxall wrote An Abridgement of the Records of
Indian Affairs: Contained in Four Folio Volumes, Transacted in
the Colony of New York, from the Year 1678 to the Year 1751.
The Abridgement, based on the records of conferences and transactions
between the Indians and the magistrates of the city and county
of Albany, consisted of both Dutch and English documents and
focused on the importance of Indian relations and the incompetency
and inefficiency of the Albany Indian commissioners, suggested
a single Crown appointment for Indian affairs, and hinted that
William Johnson would be eminently qualified for the position.
The Abridgement was promptly sent to the president of the Board
of Trade and Plantations in London, a personal friend of Wraxall's,
who subsequently forwarded to the king a series of recommendations
drafted by the board, which offered solutions relating to the
American colonies and Indian relations. Many of these recommendations
echoed or recited the suggestions put forward by Wraxall, and
in particular the idea of consolidating Indian affairs under
one appointed Crown official. The importance of Wraxall's Abridgement
in the formulation of British Indian policy in North America
remains debatable, but there is no question that his detailed
compilation of events, astute observations, and carefully worded
suggestions influenced the final outcome. In April 1755 a formal
and centralized Indian policy was finally realized when Johnson
was given "the sole Management and Direction of the Affairs of
the Six Nations and their Allies."  

<p>The close association and mutual respect between Johnson and
Wraxall was strongly evidenced by the appointment of Wraxall,
also in mid-April 1755, as Johnson's permanent secretary, a position
he held until his death. With the outbreak of the French and
Indian War in America, Wraxall participated alongside Johnson
in conducting the affairs of the Indians. At Mount Johnson, north
of the Mohawk River, a grand council was held between 21 June
and 14 July 1755 in which an agreement was reached "to renew,
to make more strong and bright than ever the Covenant Chain of
peace and friendship." The Iroquois, especially the Mohawks,
were particularly pleased with Johnson and put their trust in
the king of England. Yet, for the most part, the "western nations"
from the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes supported New France throughout
the final conflict.  

<p>In the late summer of 1755 Wraxall, employed as secretary, aide-de-camp,
and judge advocate, accompanied Johnson on the expedition against
the French stronghold at Crown Point on the west side of Lake
Champlain. A battle was fought south of that place at Lake George
on 8 September in which Johnson's colonials won a stunning victory
over a formidable force of French regulars. As a result of their
success, one of the few victories achieved by the British and
colonials over the next few years, Johnson's prestige, power,
and influence in the colonies became paramount. In the shadows,
his contributions to the shaping of British Indian policy unnoticed
and not acknowledged by the public or the press, loomed the dominant
figure of Peter Wraxall.  

<p>In January 1756, at Johnson's request, Wraxall prepared an astute
analysis of the recent events from the Indian perspective. Titled
"Thoughts upon the British Indian Interest in North America,"
the work accurately assessed the Indian view, observing in part
that "our Six Nations and their Allies, . . . look upon the present
disputes between the English and French . . . as a point of selfish
ambition in us both and are apprehensive that which ever Nation
gains their point will become their Masters not their deliverers."
He concluded this section in prophetic fashion by declaring that
the Indians suspected that neither of the two imperial rivals
intended to restore lands to the Indians or to recognise the
First Nations as the true "Proprietors of the soil."  

<p>For the next three years Wraxall continued to serve and attend
the major Indian conferences as Johnson's secretary for Indian
affairs. His last record of an Indian council was dated April
1759. But his life after 1756 was quite uneventful. He largely
withdrew from military field service. Ill health and his marriage
to Elizabeth Stillwell in 1756 may have contributed to his change
of lifestyle. For the last two years of his life, he and his
wife lived quietly in the city of New York, where he died.  

<p>Peter Wraxall made an important contribution to the formulation
and implementation of British Indian policy during a critical
period in the eighteenth century. His Abridgement and "Thoughts"
influenced the course of British Indian policy and Indian-white
relations for several decades. He understood and appreciated
the nature of Indian politics and foresaw the long and bitter
struggle between Indians and whites over the right of soil and land claims.

<p><b>Bibliography</b>: The most important and useful source for the study of Peter
Wraxall remains Charles Howard McIlwain's edition of <i>An Abridgement
of the Records of Indian Affairs: Contained in Four Folio Volumes,
Transacted in the Colony of New York, from the Year 1678 to the
Year 1751</i> (1915). In particular, McIlwain provides a lengthy
introduction that offers details, analyses, and background information
to the events germane to Wraxall. In addition, there is an abundance
of correspondence and records relating to colonial matters and
Indian conferences to and from Peter Wraxall, scattered throughout
<i>The Papers of Sir William Johnson</i>, ed. James J. Sullivan (14
vols., 1921-1965), and E. B. O'Callaghan and B. Fernow, eds.,
<i>Documents Relative to the Colonial History of the State of New
York</i> (15 vols., 1853-1887). Some standard secondary sources that
provide background details on events pertaining to Wraxall include
Milton W. Hamilton, <i>Sir William Johnson: Colonial American, 1715-1763</i>
(1976), and Francis Jennings, <i>Empire of Fortune: Crowns, Colonies
and Tribes in the Seven Years' War in America</i> (1988).</p></font size>
