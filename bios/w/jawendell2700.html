      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob A. Wendell</strong></a> was born in May 
        1753. He was the youngest son of <a href="abwendell2740.html">Abraham 
        H.</a> and <a href="elwendell2674.html">Elizabeth</a> Wendell. 
        His mother died in 1757 leaving Abraham H. Wendell to raise a large family 
        in his <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">upper</a> State Street home. 
        Jacob would have been one of the children provided for (but not actualy 
        named) in the <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2663.html">will</a> 
        filed by his dead mother's brother in 1763. 
      <p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2700">1779</a>, his personal property was valued <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2740">under</a> the assessment of his father's home.

<p>He appears to have served in the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">army</a>. In February 1782, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DHkUAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA31&lpg=RA2-PA31&dq=%22jacob+a.+wendell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=MrviUwcEI2&sig=iy5UqMmzubLzn33OUbbpZy00hSM&hl=en&ei=8ToySs6yO5aYMrzo5PYJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9">involved</a> in foraging in Massachusetts to feed horses under the command of Lt. Col. Marinus Willet. Afterwards, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2700">land</a> bounty right in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.


<p>He married Eva (aka Mary) Swart. Between 1791 and 1803, the marriage produced four children who were christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany.

<p>Perhaps he was one of the three men listed on the census in 1790 in the <a href="../../census1790.html#2740">household</a> of his father. By <a href="../../census1800.html#2700">1800</a>, he was the head of a <a href="../../wards.html#1"> first ward</a> household at a different location.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1791">1791</a>, he was identified as a member of a first ward fire engine company.

<p>In April 1793, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willabwendell2740.html">will</a> filed by his father. He was to share in the State Street home and in other properties as well. His father died in 1800. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued at a few pounds while he was living in the modest house and lots owned by "Jno. Mc Kinsey" and located deep in the <a href="../s/sschuyler8492.html#southend">South End</a> of Albany. 

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95dq=wendell&source=bl&ots=2hLtKZXz3A&sig=9NTru5Wrei0KFns50SW-7HNQkNY&hl=en&ei=Mw4cSpuJFo3KM46L0JoP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6">1813</a>, he was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad"><i>City Directory</i></a> as a cartman residing at 134 Washington (soon changed to South Pearl) and then on Frelinghuysen Streets.
 
<p>Jacob A. Wendell would have been in his seventies by 1815 - his last listing in the city directory. He probably died by 1820. His widow seems to have been absorbed within other Albany households. She is said to have survived until 1831.
