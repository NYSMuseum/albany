<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Waldron</strong></a> was born in November 1705. He was the <a href="wwaldron678.html">sec</a>ond son of Albany newcomers <a href="pwaldron668.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../vd/cavdb5740.html">Catharina  Vandenbergh</a> Waldron. He was an older son in the large family of an aspiring <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who died in 1725 - just shy of his fiftieth birthday. Cornelis then was twenty years old.

<p>Not finding the young man in our latest <a href="../../res/irs.html">sweep</a> of the community-based record, perhaps he was on the frontier during three decades of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> from 1713 to 1744.

<p>In September 1732, he <a href="#marr">marr</a>ied <a href="../vn/javness.html">Jannetie Van Ness</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, the marriage had produced eight children whose names honored both sets of grandparents.

<p>Beyond church-based family information, his name seems to have eluded community-based reference following his marriage. However, children and their offspring have been tracked to <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>.
.
<p>Perhaps he had <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kOYKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA373&lpg=PA373&dq=%22cornelius+waldron%22+van+ness&source=bl&ots=-33xGqp9Lm&sig=CjYWbKrFkYIgQWRA8tCPKroqRKQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l5IXUoqVOonY9AT-xYDIDQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22cornelius%20waldron%22&f=false">served</a> as an attorney in a land transaction in May 1754. 

<p>Cornelis Waldron <a href="#death">died</a> in May 1756 and was buried from his Albany church. Like his father, he had lived but fifty years. Perhaps, his widow was the "Mrs Waldrum" who was identified as "mantuamaker" on a <a href="../../census1756.html#324">census</a> of Albany householders made by the British army in June of 1756.</p>

<p><a name=marr></a>A family-based <a href="http://www.stoutenburgh.com/family-history/descendants-of-pieter-stoutenburg-generation-4-by-pieter-waldron/">resource</a> holds that he previously had married one "Cornelia Vanderpoel." No children of that marriage have been found to date.

Similarly, a family-based resource <a href="http://wap.archive.org/stream/genealogyoffrede00newh/genealogyoffrede00newh_djvu.txt">states</a> that he was "killed by a Hessian on May 11, 1756."
