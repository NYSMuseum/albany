<P>Referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Stephen Wynants</strong></a> (Winans), this individual lived in Albany during the last decades of the eighteenth century.

<p>Family-based resources <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wanless/janwinans.htm">tell us</a> that he was born in Horseneck, Connecticut in February 1746. He was the son of James and Sarah Reynolds Winans. His father's family traced its roots to <a hhref="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland and New Jersey. His mother was of New England ancestry. He appears to have been a middle child in a <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=REG&db=winans&id=I627">large</a> Connenctcut  family. His <a href="http://cwcfamily.org/egyc.htm#172">father</a>  moved to Dutchess County where he died in 1795 and was buried in the Bethel cemetery.

<p>Reaching thirty by the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, we <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on Stephen's wartime activities and/or service. 

<p>In November 1779, "Stephen Winans" joined a number of Dutchess County people in a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YYjPr7Ht7d8C&pg=PA372&lpg=PA372&dq=%22stephen+winans%22&source=web&ots=k4xwi_iklB&sig=_gW2CLPQxpnnpqPQZmZ5RlZb6uA#v=onepage&q&f=false">petition</a> to the governor on behalf of a refugee New York City merchant. 

<p>By 1786, Stephen had married <a href="../k/amkip.html">Amelia Kip</a> also of Dutchess County. Their marriage produced a number of children - none of whom seem to have been christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In April 1779, "Stephen Wynants" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wd-LTleLtO8C&pg=PA432&lpg=PA432&dq=%22stephen+wynants%22&source=bl&ots=McnFYMaAZ0&sig=neXUjdakA6W0xHRIpPZs0JWkeUE&hl=en&ei=cfXnTKO3IIGKlwf7rsiZCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CEcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22stephen%20wynants%22&f=false">named</a> co-executor of the estate of his friend, a Rhinebeck farmer.  However, in April 1786, he was <a href="../../sources.html#en">named</a> co-executor of the will of <a href="../p/jopruyn3556.html">John Pruyn</a> of Albany. Stephen's wife Amelia was identified as an heir to Pruyn's estate.


<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6949">1788</a>, these Wynantses were living in Albany where his house and property in the third ward were accorded moderate assessments. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6949">1790</a>, his household in the third ward was configured on the Albany census. 


<p>In August 1797, his house and stable on Montgomery Street and another dwelling house and workshop on Market Street were among those destroyed by <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#mont">fire</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his two lots in the third ward were valued on the city assessment roll. By that time, he appears to re-located from the city as, in <a href="../../census1800.html#6949">1800</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>For May 6, 1806, his name (Stephen Wynans) was was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3RXxAh_sHaAC&pg=PA538&lpg=PA538&dq=%22stephen+wynans%22&source=bl&ots=cRpmLNgEXh&sig=kqab3qfCM7miQzmQ4bFQX1nzvdg&hl=en&ei=owzoTL74MIP-8Aacr6iuCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&sqi=2&ved=0CD4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22stephen%20wynans%22&f=false">referenced</a> in a transcribed record of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>.

<p>In a deed dated April 3, 1795, the property of Stephen Wynants within the Catskill Patent was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/beers_early_settlement_athens.htm">referenced</a>.

<p>We seek defining <a href="../qqqq.html">information</a> on the later life and passing of this one-time Albany resident. </p>
