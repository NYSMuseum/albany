<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elsje Wendell Staats</b></a> probably was born during the 1670s and was the daughter of Manhattan-based Albany trader <a href="jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a> and his first wife, New Yorker Maria de Meyer Wendell. 

<p>In 1691, she was provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">will</a> filed by her father. Both her parents had passed by the time she reached adulthood. She probably spent the last childhood years in the home of her step-mother, <a href="../s/elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats Wendell</a>.</p>

<p>Elsie married <a href="../s/abstaats4551.html">Abraham Staats</a> in July 1696 at the Albany Dutch church where she was a member and where eleven of her children were baptized before 1720. </p>


<p>In 1697, her budding family was <a href="../../census1697.html#039">configured</a> on the Albany census. Afterwards, her husband moved their family to a farm across the Hudson. She was alive and living in Claverack when Abraham Staats filed his will in 1731.</p>
