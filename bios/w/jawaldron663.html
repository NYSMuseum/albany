<strong>Jannetje Waldron</strong></a> was born in April 1751. She was the daughter of Albany mason <a href="pwaldron671.html">Pieter Waldron</a> and his first wife, <a href="../l/colansing3211.html">Neeltie Lansing</a> Waldron. Her mother died and her father re-married about 1768. Her father's home was in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In May 1770, she was just nineteen when she married <a href="../j/nijerol4846.html">Nicholas Jeroleman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, they both were identified as residents of "this city." By 1789, nine children had been christened in Albany. With her husband, she was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Jerolemans raised their large family in a house in the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4846">fi</a>rst ward and later in <a href="../../census1790.html#4846">W</a>atervliet.

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Jannetje Waldron Jeroleman and her husband. Some of their children became residents of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">B</a>ethlehem.</p>
