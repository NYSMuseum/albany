<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Waters</strong></a> was born in September 1732. He was the son of <a href="jowaters6823.html">John</a> and Sara Winne Waters. He grew up in the third ward home of a newcomer schoolteacher and businessman. His father died in Albany in 1752.

<p>This individual may not have been married as no direct heirs were identified surrounding the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> of his estate.

<p>As the only surviving son (two earlier John's were christened in Albany), this individual may have been an Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">res</a>ident. On a number of occasions from 1768 to 1770, his account was paid from the city treasury. However, he probably was not the John Waters listed on the assessment roll in March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jw">1779</a>.

<p>He <a href="../../sources.html#en">appears</a> to have been in business with <a href="../t/jotbroeck55.html">John Ten Broeck</a> who owed him a share of outstanding debts due their business at the time of Waters's death. At least two other partnerships were indebted to him in substantial ammount.

<p>John Waters was buried from the Dutch church in 1786.  <a href="../../sources.html#en">Letters</a> of Administration stating that he was living in Rensselaerswyck were issued to Christopher A. Yates and John Lansing, Jr. were issued in January 1788. An extensive inventory of his estate included silver pieces, books, furniture and household items, and clothing. Also, a large number of mostly small debts due his estate were included in the inventory. Probably, a younger, same-named <a href="jowaters.html">individual</a> married Dorothea Van Benthuysen in Albany in 1781.

<p>The existence of that prominent, same-named <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">newcomer</a> and his documented probable death date for this sixty-four-year-old, raises too many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> for us to proceed further at this time.</p>
