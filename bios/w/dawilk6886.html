      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Daniel Wilkinson</strong></a> (aka Wilkerson 
        or <a href="../../res/sp.html">Willemse</a>) was a soldier in the Albany 
        <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> who married Anna Bradt in 1696 
        and was an Albany resident for a decade or more at the beginning of the 
        eighteenth century. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and precise path to Albany. 
      <p>In July 1696, he exchanged vows with Albany native <a href="../b/anbradt4332.html">Anna 
        Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At 
        the time of the wedding, both partners were identified as "young people" 
        and both were living in Albany. Anna's son had been baptized there in 
        1693 but no father was named. The couple does not appear to have had any 
        other children. 
      <p>In 1697 and 1698, his name was on the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA470&lpg=RA12-PA470&dq=%22daniell+wilkinsonvan%22&source=web&ots=hq0MrgbxF_&sig=7sibr8RsHv3rSzUurCrKg6LWnGQ#v=onepage&q=%22daniell%20wilkinson&f=false">roster</a> 
        of James Weems' company and he was scheduled to be paid as an enlisted 
        man. 
      <p>In June <a href="../../doc/cc/0627699.html">1699</a>, the city council 
        held that he (Daniel Wilkeson) was among <a href="../../newcomers.html">those</a> 
        who did not possess the freedom of the city and thus would be <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> 
        (or otherwise engaging in business) illegally.. 
      <p>In September 1702, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willedreims.html">will</a> 
        of a victualler in Albany. 
      <p>In 1702 and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6886">1709</a>, his 
        ("Willemse") property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
        was valued modestly on the Albany assessment roll. 
      <p>After 1709, the name of Daniel Wilkinson has not been found on the community 
        based record. </p>
