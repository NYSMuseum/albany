<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Catharina Witbeck</strong></a> was born during the first half of the seventeenth century. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers Jan Thomase and Geertruy Dochter Witbeck.
 
<p>By the 1660s, she had married Albany trader <a href="../g/jaglen4926.html">Jacob Sanderse Glen</a>. The marriage produced at least five children who established the <a href="../g/glen.html">Glen</a> family name in early New York. These Glens lived on upper State Street where Jacob Sanderse was a prominent fur trader. They were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

  
<p>Catharina Witbeck Glen was pregnant when she lost her husband in 1685. By terms of his <a href="../../wills/willjaglen4926.html">will</a>, she was accorded use of his estate. In 1686, this widow acquired another lot in Albany. She was identified as the head of their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household in <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#1708">1689</a>.

<p>In April 1696, she married widower <a href="../d/jovdouw2084.html">Jonas V. Douw</a>. These Douws lived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. She died sometime thereafter. Douw lived until 1736!
