<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Willis</strong></a> was born between 1756 and 1774. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Perhaps he was a son or kinsman of <a href="jowillis.html">John Willis</a>, an Albany blacksmith of an earlier generation or of <a href="thwill6920.html">Thomas Willis</a> and his wife Albany native Rachel Radcliff whose son was <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/WILLIS/2003-07/1059657783">said</a> to have been christened in Albany (but not in the printed records of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch chutch</a>) in June 1769.

<p>In January 1790, Philip Willis witnessed a baptism at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Du</a>tch church with "Peggy Adams." 


<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and property on Pine Street were assessed modestly. However, the assessment also showed the modest personal holdings of three newcomers including <a href="../p/alparks.html">Alexander Parks</a> under his real property. The next year in <a href="../../census1800.html#6919">1800</a>, the Willis household included four young children. The Parks household <a href="../../census1800.html#alpa">was</a> configured nearby but separately. The household of Philip Willis appeared on the Albany census for the final time in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22willis+philip%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22willis%20philip%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was identified in the annual city directory as a <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith</a> living on Fox, then Orange Streets, and, in 1820 thru 1822, on Chapel Street.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of blacksmith Philip Willis. With so many unanswered questions, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
