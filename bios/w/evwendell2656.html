<P><a href="#sources"><b>Evert Wendell, Jr.</b></a> was born about 1660. He was the last child born to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="evwendell2655.html">Evert Janse</a> and <a href="../t/sustruax.html">Susanna Truax</a> Wendell. Evert Jr.'s mother died shortly thereafter. His father re-married in 1663. By that time, Evert Sr. and his family were living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. He was the younger brother of future Albany mayor <a href="jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a>.</p>


<p>In 1681, he married <a href="../s/elsanders1416.html">Elizabeth Sanders</a>, daughter of a newcomer entrepreneur. By 1700, the marriage had produced ten children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Evert was a member.</p>

<p>Known as "Evert Janse, Jr.," he followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html"> fur trade</a>. Early on, he established his own 
<a href="../../census1679.html#30">home</a> in the <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#2">second ward</a>. Serving as constable and juror, in 1694, he was elected assistant alderman. He held that office for several years - during which he was one of those appointed to take a census of the Iroquois. By <a href="../../census1697.html#117">1697</a>, his household included six children. Two years later, he joined his neighbors in signing a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2656">oath</a> of loyalty to England.</p>

<p>Evert Wendell, Jr. filed a <a href="../../wills/willevwendelljr.html">will</a> in 1690. He died in June 1702 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church.</p>
