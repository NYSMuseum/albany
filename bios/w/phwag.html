<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously,  one <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Wagoner</strong></a> lived on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South</a>side of Albany during the last decades of the eighteenth century. Was he connected to a "Dr." Henry Van Wagonner who also was listed on contemporary community survey documents? We seek defining information on Philip's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. At this point, a number of backgrounds seem plausible as he may have been <a href="../../res/sp.html">named</a> Wagoner or Van Vaggenen!

<p>A number of similarly named characters served the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary cause.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6791">1788</a>, "Philip Waggoner's" house, lot, and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> were valued modestly on the city assessment roll. A decade later, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessed</a> similarly.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6791">1790</a>, Philip "Van Waganer" was listed on the census as a resident of the first ward and the head of a household that also included two boys and two unspecified females. At that time, five other Van Wagoner or Wagoner households were configured on the census for Albany and surrounding Watervliet. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6791">1800</a>, his household included a young man (aged 16-24), Philip (born prior to 1756), and a woman born between 1756 and 1774.

<p>In 1798, he was identified as a pewholder at the First <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>. A decade earlier, "Philip Wagener" had <a href="../../lutheran.html#1788">signed</a> in on behalf of his unnamed wife. In 1790 and again in 1793, <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part8.html">Catharina and Philip Waggenen</a> witnessed baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In November 1798, his name appeared on a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">list</a> of eligible jurors for <a href="../../org/mayorct.html">Mayor's Court</a> actions. At that time, he was identified as a baker.


<p>In September 1812, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters of administration</a> were granted in Albany County on the estate of one "Philip Wagganor."</p>
