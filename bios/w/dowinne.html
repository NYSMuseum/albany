<strong>Douwe Winne</strong></a> was born in July 1743. He was the twin son of <a href="kiwinne2989.html">Kiliaen</a> and his second wife <a href="../f/refonda3839.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Winne. He grew up as the youngest son in a large combined family of a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> woodworker and city official. 

<p>This individual does not seem to have married. However, in September 1768 and December 1771, he witnessed the baptisms of his nieces at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> with Dirckje and Cath. Winne.  


<p>In May 1767, his name (Douwen Wennee) appeared on the roster of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company captained by John Winne. Otherwise, his name seems to have been absent from the community-based records thus far encountered.


<p>Identifying himself as a resident of "Albany City," Douwe Winne filed a <a href="../../wills/willdowinne.html">will</a> in October 1774. His estate included <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real</a> property but did not describe it further. It named his siblings and a niece/godchild as his heirs. The will passed probate in February 1775. He had lived a short thirty-one years.</p>
