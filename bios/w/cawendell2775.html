<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Wendell</b></a> was born in March 1723. She was the daughter of <a href="jowendell2945.html">Johannes E.</a> and <a href="../k/ankip5944.html">Anna Kip</a> Wendell. Unlike those of her siblings, her baptism was not recorded in the register of the Albany Dutch church. She grew up in a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> merchant's home but lost her father when Johannes E. Wendell died in 1739. Her mother lived until 1779.

<p>She was well past her twenty-eighth birthday in November 1751 when she married <a href="../m/gymarselis718.html">Gysbert Marselis</a>. The marriage produced seven children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

In 1763, Catharina was named among the<a href="../../wills/willevwendell2663.html"> heirs</a> in the estate of her brother, <a href="evwendell2663.html">Evert Wendell</a>. 

<p>Gysbert Marselis died in 1779. In 1783, she was identified as his widow and named co-executor of the estate of her unmarried sister, <a href="geewendell2872.html">Geesje Wendell</a>.</p> 

<p>Perhaps she resided in the home of her only surviving son, John Marselis!</p>

<p> The widow Catharina Wendell Marselis died in December 1815.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Catharina Wendell Marselis is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 2775. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Beginning with the absent baptism, her life is much more puzzling that those of most other Wendell family members. At this point, our exposition is cautious!</font></p>
