<P><a href="../../trades/silver.html">P</a>ewterer <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry Will</strong></a> is <a href="#acct">said</a> to have been born in Germany April 1734. He is said to have been the son of New York City pewterer John Will (active 1752-63) who emigrated from Niewsted on the Rhine. He <a href="../../res/guess.html">was</a> of <a href="../ger.html">German</a> ancestry. Henry is <a href="http://www.hiltpewter.com/item.php?id=664&cid=7">said</a> to have been the older brother of <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/William_Will_Pewterer.html?id=U00zOAAACAAJ">reknowned</a> Pennsylvania pewterer William Will. We seek <a href="../../nat.html">nat</a>uralization information for this individual who probably was not born in America.

<p>This sketch will focus on his time and work <a href="../../criteria.html">in</a> Albany.

<p>In 1761, he had received a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zhhYAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA163&dq=%22Henry+Will%22+haan&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HaDfU-KGMcjeoATvyYFA&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Henry%20Will%22%20haan&f=false">license</a> to marry one Magdaline Haan. He is <a href="#acct">said</a> to have been married at the Reformed church in New York City in  November. In 1776 and 78, their daughters were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. (Witnesses were Albany German pillars Paul and Elizabeth <a href="../h/pahog8494.html">Hogstrasser</a> and also Alcasatian newcomer <a href="../m/jomaley.html">John Maley</a>.) We seek birth/baptism records from other churches to fill out the family identified on subsequent surveys that probably began to form during the early 1760s.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ero0AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=%22Henry+Will,+Pewterer%22&source=bl&ots=cNXe2k35my&sig=QoqQ7-oxU_Ckc9mMnbdyDXzpxrM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yHwMVNylBYOAsQScqIGIAg&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Henry%20Will%2C%20Pewterer%22&f=false">October 1765</a>, he was identified as a pewterer when he "P" (paid) for the "Freedom" of New York City.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, the name of "Henry Will" was crossed off a <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> assessment <a href="../../sources.html#uny">roll</a>. 

<p>His <a href="#acct"><b>account book</b></a> covering the years 1763 to 1800 details his business in New York City, <a href="../../lastdays.html">Albany</a>, and with clients from in-between. A substantial number of "Albany names" appear in it for the war years - his time in Albany. But, we cannot be certain that all of those in question are Albany people and not same-named downriver clients. Numerous examples of his work can be viewed <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22henry+will%22+pewter&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=NRbqU8DtIIXyigL_3YH4DA&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&biw=1600&bih=699">online</a>. We seek specifics on Will's  creations from his time in Albany. However, future metalware manufacturer <a href="../w/gewitbeck1791.html">Gerrit Witbeck</a> seems to have supplied him with rock salt and other commodities. We are more comfortable regarding his business with Albany merchant <a href="../m/jomaley.html">John Maley</a> during 1785. 

<p>Probably a different Henry Will served in the East Camp militia in 1767 and later as an ensign and lieutenant in a German Camp militia company. 

<p>He probably left New York ahead of the British occupation. On April 11, 1776, a Manhattan newspaper <a href="#acct">noted that</a>: <blockquote><i>Henry Will, Pewterer, Acquaints the public that he has removed to Albany, to Albany where he intends to carry on the Pewterer's business in all its branches. As he has hitherto been favoured with the custom of his friends in and about Albany, so he hopes to merit their continuance; - an assortment of Pewter war will be constantly kept by him; old pewter will be exchanged for new, or cash given for it.</i></blockquote>

<p>During those years, he was among a sizeable (and diverse) number of New Yorkers who found <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">refuge</a> in Albany.  In August 1776, he wrote from Albany to Surgeon Matthew <a href="../../res/sp.html">M</a>anus (probably <a href="http://www.wargs.com/family/0059.html">Matthias Maus</a> at Ft. George) listing supplies he had procured. During the war years, his name appeared on an Albany-based <a href="../../coc.html">list</a> of subscribers for clothing.

<p>In May 1778, he was able to vote to elect Patriot stalwart Dr. <a href="../s/sastringer5046.html">Samuel Stringer</a> alderman in the third ward.

<p>In March 1779, his real and personal property were valued on the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1497">assessment roll</a> for Albany's third ward. The October assessment listed the name of <a href="../y/peyoung.html">Peter Young</a> just below Will. At that time, a number of German background newcomers lived in that <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> neighborhood.

<p>After the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war</a>, his name appeared on a list of those who would be accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1497">bounty right</a> in conjunction with a   <a hef="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment composed of men from the city of Albany. However, we seek information on the specific war-related activities of an artisan who turned forty just before the outbreak of hostilities.

<p> July 1785, the New York paper <a href="#acct">rep</a>orted that he had returned to his house in New York ant that he had resumed the pewtering business. 
 
<p>By 1787, he had returned to New York where was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2Bg8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=%22henry+will,+new+york+pewterer%22&source=bl&ots=uhyZuQXfJK&sig=xZ5XRlwyQbqF9rNO4kNPK0XRlac&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r0rmU788lcuxBM7sgdAF&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20will%2C%20new%20york%20pewterer%22&f=false">named</a> co-executor of the estate of the late John A. Stuart. At that time, he was identified as a pewterer of New York City. He was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YbAUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=%22henry+will%22+1802+new+york&source=bl&ots=OM1EPiXg8X&sig=eg1l2WRvMNRTsKvkP6q-DHVyUBM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iEfmU__aD4-BogTJ1YGgCA&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20will%22%201802%20new%20york&f=false">identified</a> as the treasurer of the German Reformed Church and of the "Musical Society" of New York in 1789. (His daughter married <a href="http://newyorkfamilyhistory.org/queries/content/about-nygb">there</a> in 1798.)  By 1790, his East Ward household with ten people was configured on the census in New York City.

<p>He is <a href="http://www.wolfpewter.com/hollow-ware/American/H_Will_Tankard.html">said</a> to have retired wealthy in 1793. During the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=%22henry+will%22+1802+new+york&source=bl&ots=Rj5xGckiba&sig=f0bFGcd_wNeQ7tIxsiJddnJmBM0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_HzrU5qEBc-BogTj3YG4CA&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20will%22&f=false">1790s</a>, a Henry Will represented New York County in the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Ass</a>embly. 

<p>His name does not appear on the rolls of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a> dating from the early 1800s. However, we are not at all certain of a connection and have not pursued him once he <a href="../../na/na.html">left</a> Albany.

<p>Refugee pewterer and wartime Albany resident Henry Will is said to have died in New York about 1802.</p>
