<strong>Jannetje (Jane) Williams</strong></a> was born in November 1750. She was the daughter of John and Cornelia Bogardus Williams.

<p>In April or May 1771, she married newcomer <a href="../m/romccl725.html">Robert Mc Clallan</a>.  Over the next twenty years, a number of children were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Her affinity was to the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> but her husband was a <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> member and church officer.


<p>These <a jref="../res/sp/html">Mc</a> Clallans raised their family in a substantial home on lower <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. Robert was a prominent businessman and Albany official. In 1798, he was appointed treasurer of New York State. His success was short-lived. After losing his fortune, for a time, Robert and Jane ran a well-known Albany boarding house. 
 
<p>Jannetje Williams Mc Clallan lost her husband in October 1817. She probably was the head of the Albany household as enumerated on the census of 1820. In that year, the widow was living at 100 North Pearl Street. In 1822, she was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a> at 38 Dock Street. She died sometime thereafter.</p>
