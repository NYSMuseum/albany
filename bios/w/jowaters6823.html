<P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/jowaters.jpg" width=180 align=left vspace=4 border=1 hspace=4 alt="portrait of John Waters"></a>Traditional sources <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">state</a> that <a href="../../res/sp.html">John Waters</a> was a native of Flushing, Long Island. He was born prior to 1700.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ggQKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA655&lpg=PA655&dq=%22john+walters%22+albany&source=bl&ots=gKHxvinm1p&sig=q-F6ouGJbJL3HIadCfP6uPbZ3mo&hl=en&ei=LVYvTKCZK4H7lwfT5_3bCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22john%20walters%22%20albany&f=false">1709</a>, John Walters was identified and paid as the clerk of the Commissioners <a href="../../cia.html">of</a> Indian Affairs. 
<p>He (John <a href="../../res/sp.html">W</a>alters) married Albany-area native Sara <a href="../w/winne.html">Winne</a> in October 1721. By 1735, four of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was an occasional baptism sponsor. However, John Waters was a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.</p>
 
<p>He was known as a schoolteacher and was sometimes identified as a vintner.</p>
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, he was listed as a freeholder in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Two years later, he was ordered by the city council to surrender a portion of his land for use for fortificatons. His account also was paid from the city treasury.</p>
 
<p>John Waters died in August 1752 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church. At the least, his <a href="jowaters6826.html">son</a> and two daughters became Albany residents. Perhaps (but not with certainty), it was his descendants who carried on <a href="dawaters6821.html">in</a> Albany through the end of the eighteenth century!</p>

<div class="smalltext"> <A href="../../criteria.html"> <IMG align=left alt="the people of colonial Albany" border=1 width=30 height=30 hspace=4   src="../../images/jpg/logoicon.jpg" vspace=4></A> <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of John Waters is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6823. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We seek defining information on his background. Provincial <a href="../../sources.html#aw">probate records</a> point to a Waters family of Queens. However, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelling</a> of the name as "John Walters" dictates even more caution.

The existence of the portrait perhaps signifies that we are missing an important part of his story. </p>
