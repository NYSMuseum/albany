<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Harmanus Wendell</strong></a> was born in 1678. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="jewendell2940.html">Jeronimus</a> and <a href="../v/arvisscher4100.html">Ariantie Visscher</a> Wendell. His father was a shoemaker and <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who died before Harmanus was married.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#140">1697</a>, Harmanus Wendell was identified on the census as living alone in a first ward home. Two years later, he married <a href="../g/anglen4917.html">Anna Glen</a>. By 1716, eight children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>Harmanus Wendell quickly established himself as a trader and landholder who had frequent business with <a href="../../corporation.html">Albany</a> and the provincial governments. His substantial <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property was <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2667">assessed</a> moderately on Albany tax rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2667">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, his name appeared on the list of qualified voters.

<p>These Wendells lived on the south side of upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> in a classic Albany Dutch house that <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">remained</a> in the family for many years. He held additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> in Albany and beyond.

<p>He served his community as an assessor, juror, and first ward alderman - for a decade beginning in 1710. He was an active councilman and <a href="../../cia.html">Indian commissioner</a>. He also belonged to the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. 
 
<p>Harmanus Wendell died in December 1731 and was buried beneath the Albany church. He had lived fifty-three years. His widow lived until 1756.
