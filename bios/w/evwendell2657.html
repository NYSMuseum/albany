 <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Evert Wendell</B></A> was born in Albany in 1681. He was the second son of shoemaker and trader <a href="jewendell2940.html">Jeronimus 
              (Harmanus)</a> and <a href="../v/arvisscher4100.html">Ariantie Visscher</a> 
              Wendell - both members of the first generation of Albany-born children 
              of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/evwendell2657.jpg" align=right width=200 hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1 alt="Evert Wendell"></a> His father died in 1690 leaving his widow and coming-of-age sons to further his business enterprises.</P>
  
			
<p>While still an adolescent, Evert began to trade with both Native American and settler clients. His <a href="../../doc/acctbkew.html">account book</a> covering the years 1695 to 1726 <a href="#ab">details</a> almost 2,000 transactions.

<P> In 1710, at age twenty-nine, Evert married young <a href="../l/englansing3243.html">Engeltie 
            Lansing</a>. Several years older than most Albany grooms, he had spent 
            considerable time <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> on the frontier beyond Albany. After his 
            marriage, he settled down in Albany. Between 1711 and 1734, ten children 
            were born in their upper State Street home.</p>

<p>Initially, Evert Wendell made his way in the public arena by selling "strong liquor" and other items and performing chores for the Albany government including auditing books and collecting taxes. But after he appeared for his mother in a case against the city in 1703, he began to build a following as an attorney who represented his Dutch speaking neighbors before Albany courts. Known as a lawyer, he would continue to practice law in the Albany area for the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>Wendell was elected to the Albany Common council in 1712 - serving as assistant alderman for the first ward for several years. Over the first half of the eighteenth century, his home was an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">landmark</a>.</p>

          <p>In July 1749, Evert Wendell <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2657.html">filed his 
            will</a>. It detailed some of his extensive holdings as he parcelled 
            them out to his sons and daughters. He died in 1750 and was buried 
            in the Dutch church cemetery. An able representative of the third 
            generation of one of early Albany's principal families, this Evert 
            Wendell was an Albany insider who combined business sense and legal skills to transform his family fortune into real estate - not 
            the least of which was a large chunk of city land from State Street 
            south to the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>.</p>

              number</A> 2657. He did not come of age until the deaths of his 
              grandfather, Evert Janse - founder of the family, and his uncle, 
              Evert Janse Wendell, Jr. Thus, this prominent eighteenth-century 
              Albanian was known simply as "Evert Wendell." This profile is derived 
              chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a> 
              and from provincial records. 
			  
<p><a name=ab>His business records are partially detailed in an account book in the collections of the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/colonial.html">New-York
