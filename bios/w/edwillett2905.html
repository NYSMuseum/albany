<strong>Edward Willett</strong></a> was born in October 1786. Most likely, he was the son of Albany residents <a href="edwillett6905.html">Edward S.</a> and <a href="../f/safryer8139.html">Sara Fryer</a> Willett.

<p>His wife was his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> neighbor <a href="../c/mgtcooper491.html">Margaret Cooper</a> (b. 1787). The marriage produced a number of children - all born <a href="../../criteria.html">after</a> 1800. At least one of their children was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>This Edward Willett was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=%22edward+willet%22+albany&source=bl&ots=2hNuMV_v6v&sig=Nh0r1uP6hy2zRVVBiaNdFDUAvxc&hl=en&ei=tPheS8WWJNGj8AaJm_iUDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22edward%20willet%22%20albany&f=false">admitted</a> to the practice of law in June 1807. At least two other same-named individuals were active in Albany during his lifetime.

<p>These Willetts set up their <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">home</a> in the first ward at an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22willett+edward%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22willett%20edward%22&f=false">address</a> later known as <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">18</a>  South Pearl Street. First his parents and then his widow lived there as well.
 
<p>He was a member and vestryman at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church.

<p>Edward Willett filed a <a href="../../wills/willedwillett2905.html">will</a> in May 1815. It named his wife and two children as heirs. He died shortly thereafter and was buried in the Dutch church plot.  According to his tombstone inscription, he had lived less than thirty years.  Afterwards, widow Margaret  lived at a number of first ward addresses until her death in 1846.
