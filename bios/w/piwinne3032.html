<P><A href="#biography"><B>Pieter Winne </B></A> was born in May 1690. He was the first of the eight children born to the marriage of Albany mainstays <a href="frwinne2113.html">Frans</a> and 
<a href="../g/elsgansevoort4654.html">Elsie Gansevoort</a> Winne.</P>

<P>The boy grew up along the Albany waterfront - learning from a successful father the changing realities of the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> and also how to turn farm and forest products into marketable goods. By his late teens, Pieter Winne was running family errands and earning extra income from jobs performed for the Albany government.</P>

          <p>By the 1720s, he was skippering his own boat on the Hudson River 
            - carrying <a href="#family">cargoes</a> for his family and other 
            community people as well. Called "Captain" Winne, his basic run was 
            between Albany and New York with frequent stops at the river ports 
            in-between. <a href="#receipt"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigrimiller.jpg" align=right width=225 vspace=4 hspace=0 alt="excerpt from Captain Winne's receipt book" border=0></a> 
            Although he also transacted business from the Winnes' riverside home, 
            he was widely known as a "skipper" and was among the <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html#pw">most 
            active</a> of the Albany-based <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">Hudson 
            River carriers</a>. His recently recovered <a href="#receipt">receipt 
            book</a> for the 1730s and 40s provides much insight on the nature 
            and rhythms of his frequent trips.</p>

          <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1715">1715</a>, this young man was elected to the Albany city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> as an assistant in the third ward. In 1726, he was elected third ward 
            alderman and served for several years. During that time, he was active the development of the city's <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">external lands</a> and also served as a member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Indian Commissioners</a>. A <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3032">prominent figure</a> in his native community, Pieter Winne also had an identity beyond Albany.</p>  

<p>His monthly trips to New York brought him into contact with many of the leading people of colonial New York. These contacts and his person business downriver made him an attractive choice to represent Albany at the provincial level. In 1737, he was elected to provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> for the city of Albany. Except for a four year hiatus from 1748 to 1752, he served in the Assembly until his death. His prominence also qualified him to receive a share of several patents for frontier lands during the <a href="../../peace.html">period of peace</a> in the 1730s and 40s.

<p>Pieter Winne was one of a few successful early Albany men who did not <a href="../../marriages.html">marry</a>. He inherited his <a href="../../census1756.html#54">parents' home</a> and then perhaps brought in his sister Catharina and her husband, <a href="../d/abdouw2052.html">Abraham Douw</a>, to live in the Winne house. His long-term business connection with Douw explains why his family was provided for in Winne's will. Both men were partners in the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga Patent</a> of 1741. </p>
 
<p>In his <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne3032.html">will</a>, filed in 1753, Pieter identified himelf as a "gentleman" of Albany and stated that he was "in health." Without direct heirs, the bulk of his substantial estate was left to his brother-in-law Abraham Douw and to Pieter's nephew and namesake, <a href="../d/pwdouw.html">Pieter Winne Douw</a>. Captain Pieter Winne died in June 1759. He had lived for seventy-three years.
