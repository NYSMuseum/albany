      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Daniel K. Winne</b></a> was born in 1731. He was 
        the first son born to the marriage of Albany woodsmith <a href="kiwinne2989.html">Kiliaen 
        Winne</a> and his wife, <a href="../f/refonda3839.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> 
        Winne. He grew up in a large family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. </p>
      <p>Daniel K. Winne married twice. His first wife was Elizabeth Dox who died 
        following the birth of their only child in November 1756. In 1763, he 
        married <a href="../b/jabancker2852.html">Jannetje Bancker</a> in the 
        Schenectady Dutch church. That marriage produced at least three more children 
        including <a href="../w/wbwinne.html">William B. Winne</a> - a well-known 
        Albany personage of the nineteenth century.</p>
      <p>These Winnes lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> 
        where he owned a house and kept boarders. However, his primary occupation 
        was that of the <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanner</a>. During 
        the 1760s-80s, he held a number of lots suitable for tan pits located 
        along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.</p>
      <p>Although he held no municipal offices, Daniel K. Winne took part in community 
        affairs. In 1766, he may have been the "Daniel Winne" who stood with his 
        neighbors in <a href="../../solconst.html#dawi">opposition</a> to the 
        Stamp Act. The next year, "Daenyul K. Wennee" was identified as a sergeant 
        in Captain John Winne's company of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. 
        A decade later, he supported the Revolutionary movement with monetary 
        contributions, he quartered soldiers, and was paid to repair the barracks 
        and provide firewood. However, his name was not included on the lists 
        of supporters who later were granted land bounty rights. Perhaps he had 
        passed before the allocations were made!</p>
      <p>Although some references to business with him have been found for the 
        late 1780s, he probably was dead before 1790. His house in the third ward 
        and two lots on Foxes Creek were listed on the assessment roll for March 
        1779.</p>
