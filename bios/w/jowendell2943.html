<strong>Johannes Je. Wendell</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Johannes Wendell, Jr.) was born in January 1684. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="jewendell2940.html">Jeronimus</a> and <a href="../v/arvisscher4100.html">Ariantie Visscher</a> Wendell. His family included six children by the time his father died during the 1690s. Widow Ariantie Wendell then took over as <a href="../../census1697.html#004">head</a> of their State Street home and became a successful fur trader herself afterwards. She died in 1741.

<p>In June 1708, this Johannes married interpreter's daughter <a href="../v/suviele.html">Susanna Viele</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1720, five children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1711">1711</a>, "Johannes Jer." was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. The next <a href="../../org/cc.html#1712">year</a>, he was high constable. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1715">1715</a>, he was chosen <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, was a member of a militia <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#2943">troop</a>, and was named to a jury. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2943">1709</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings, located next to the <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4100-2">second house</a> of his mother, were accorded a moderate assessment. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2943">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of first ward freeholders. His name was not found on subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">lists</a> of city residents.


<p>This Johannes Wendell died in October 1743 and was buried at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flats</a>.</p>
