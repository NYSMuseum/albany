He grew up in a very large combined family living at his father's establishment on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South side</a>.

<p>In January 1744, he married <a href="../vi/savi2484.html">Sara Van Iveren</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She died after the birth of one child in 1745. In October 1755, he married <a href="../f/elfonda3817.html">Elizabeth Fonda</a>. By 1766, five more children had been christened in the church where he was a pewholder, baptism sponsor, and deacon.

He lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where his property was valued comparable to that of other middling business people. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1750">1750</a> and 1763, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6319">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. In 1766, he joined with other Albany men to <a href="../../solconst.html#6319">sign</a> the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty.
