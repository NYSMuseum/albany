<strong>Jellis Winne, Jr.</strong></a> was born in June 1778. He was the son of <a href="jawinne2958.html">Jacob</a> and Susanna Everts Winne. He was the eldest son in the small family of a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> mainstay. This future Albany resident was known as Jacob Winne, Jr. to distinguish him from  a more <a href="jewinne2965.html">prominent ancestor</a> who died in 1804.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued at $100 along with others on the wharf in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. That began a long-term <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pykbAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA265&lpg=PA265&dq=%22jellis+winne%22+albany&source=bl&ots=64W5P6vGs4&sig=5P3Sqno-Vkipym3Qs1kMQ2yVKIM&hl=en&ei=VaUzS4_aIMW5lAfJ74ygBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22jellis%20winne%22%20albany&f=false">association</a> with the Albany waterfront. Perhaps he was one of the young men <a href="../../census1800.html#2965">enumerated</a> in the third ward household of his godfather, (grandfather or uncle) <a href="jewinne2965.html">J</a>ellis Winne, in 1800.


<p>His wife was <a href="../f/safonda2967.html">Sara Fonda</a>, daughter of <a href="../f/jofondajr.html">John Fondey, Jr.</a> who may have become Jellis's partner. The marriage produced a number of children.

<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, these Winnes had set up their home on lower <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a>. Beginning in 1813, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22jellis+winne%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22winne%20jellis%22&f=false">city directories</a> identified him as a merchant residing at 10 Columbia Street with a store and "earthen warehouse" in partnership with Fondey on Court (South Market) Street. He also was the cashier of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a> from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA528&lpg=PA528&dq=%22jellis+winne%22+bank&source=bl&ots=m0fWUDfIhW&sig=kvpQNaP6TDxfbRnClbuwnAytyl4&hl=en&ei=g8YzS66aINWelAfS1_iYBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CBkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22jellis%20winne%22%20bank&f=false">1832</a> until his death in 1849. 

<p>In 1813, he was elected alderman for the third ward. In 1815, he was the ward supervisor.

<p>In <a href="../../wills/willjofondajr.html">1814</a>, he was named co-executor of the estate of his father-in-law.
 
<p>In 1813, he was among the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=n1Y4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36&dq=%22jellis+winne%22+albany&source=bl&ots=UWyC1ILtnC&sig=52IFTf-Wf3kpPA_DRddt2bdd3nQ&hl=en&ei=tK4zS7bjJoejlAeck4GfBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=%22jellis%20winne%22%20albany&f=false">officers</a> of the "Albany Steamboat Company." In April 1823, he was <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/amasa-j-amasa-junius-parker/landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek/page-8-landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek.shtml">named</a> as one of the commissioners for the construction of the Albany Basin.
<p>For several decades he was <a href="http://www.schist.org/library/deeds/DeedFile.htm">active</a> on the Albany and Albany-area 
<a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market.
<p>In 1833, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willabvvechten.html">will</a> of his friend jurist Abraham Van Vechten. 

<p>Sara Fonda Winne passed on in November 1836. Jellis Winne, Jr. died in July 1849 at the age of seventy-one.
