<strong>Johannes Wendell, Jr.</strong></a> was born in March 1684. He was the son of <a href="jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a> and his second wife, <a href="../s/elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats</a>  Wendell. Johannes Sr. may have fathered a dozen children in two marriages before his untimely death early in 1692.

<p>In 1691, he was <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">named</a> as one of the many heirs to his father's substantial estate.

<p>Johannes Jr.'s wife was <a href="elwalters6801.html">Elizabeth Walters</a>. Between 1708 and 1728, the marriage produced twelve children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>This Wendell family set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where his moderate holdings were valued on the assessment of <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2944">1709</a>.

<p>In June 1719, he was named in the will filed by his father-in-law, Robert Walters of New York.

<p>However, the marriage came to an abrupt end when "Capt. Johannes Wendell" was buried at the Flats on January 13, 1729. He had not reached his forty-fifth birthday. His widow may have lived until 1745.</p>

The life of Johannes <a href="wendell.html">Wendell</a>, Jr. is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 2944. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. With a same-named <a href="../w/jowendell2944.html">cousin</a> born just two months earlier, we exercise caution here with at least two same-named individuals living to adulthood  in Albany at the same time. We are distinguishing him as "Captain Johannes Wendell."
