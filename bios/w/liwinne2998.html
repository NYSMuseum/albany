<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Livinius Winne</strong></a> was born in July 1745. He was the son of <a href="bewinne.html">Benjamin</a> and <a href="../va/ravarn.html">Rachel Van Arnhem</a> Winne. His first name has been <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled variously and a number of same-named contemporaries lived in greater Albany County. His parents were residents of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck and this individual lived in the part of the manor that became <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> as well. This individual was sometimes referred to as "L<a href="../../res/sp.html">e</a>vinius B. Winne" and also "Livinius Winne, Jr."

<p>By 1768, he had married <a href="../l/malansing3522.html">Maria Lansing</a>. By 1788, ten <a href="http://www.eancestry.org/getperson.php?personID=I10750&tree=nichols">children</a> had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>About thirty at the outbreak of hostilities, Livinius B. Winne supported the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties. Relevant, community-based records called him "Levinus Winne Jr." and noted that he was a member of the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> for Rensselaerswyck in 1778. In 1779, he signed a <a href="../../doc/pettillman1779.html">petition</a> in support of a neighbor. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2998">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany city militia regiment. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2998">1790</a>, the household of "Levinus B. Winney" was configured on the Watervliet census. Living in the house were ten family members and three slaves. A decade later, his Watervliet <a href="../../census1800.html#2998">household</a> included three adolescent males, a girl, and a slave in addition to the aging Livinius and Maria.

<p>This individual was a resident of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. However, he has not been encountered on the <a href="../../cbr.html">city-based resources</a> thus far encountered.
 
<p>Livinius Winne lost his wife in March 1824. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=maria+%22levinus+winne%22&source=bl&ots=Sq6sYNxkyf&sig=9nYo3CMNGsuMfYcsneCip1HtlRU&hl=en&ei=RvZgTo_vL-nI0AGH6qEq&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%20levinus%20winne%22&f=false">died</a> in March 1825 shy of his eighty-first birthday. Along with his wife, in 1847 he was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/DRCCemW-Z.htm">re-interred</a> in the Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
