<strong>James Wynkoop</strong></a> was born in March 1769. He was the youngest <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wynkoop/webdocs/jacobusx.htm">son</a> of <a href="jawynkoop6954.html">Jacobus</a> and Alida Myers Wynkoop. Due to wartime exigencies, his family moved from New York to Kingston and finally settled in Albany by the 1780s. Jacobus Wynkoop's <a href="../../census1790.html#6954">house</a> was located near the waterfront in the third ward. 



<p>In February 1791, James married <a href="../../loc/northend.html">N</a>orth End neighbor <a href="../d/cadunbar2250.html">Catalina Dunbar</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1811, the marriage had produced five children.

<p>In November 1794, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>  noted that he was a grocer located at 21 <a href="../../streets.html#market">M</a>arket Street. Two years later, he was identified as a fireman. In 1799, his personal property was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">valued</a> under a third ward household. Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#6955">1800</a>, he was identified on the census as the head of a household located where his father had been a decade earlier. By <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA97,M1">1813</a>, he had moved to the first ward where <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> identified him as a merchant living on <a href="../../streets.html#court">South Market Street</a>.  

<p>James Wynkoop was dead in 1821, when his widow was identified as the householder on South Market Street. Wynkoop's will passed probate in Albany County in February 1821. His widow <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wynkoop/webdocs/burialgd.htm">survived</a> until 1838.
