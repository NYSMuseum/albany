<strong>David Waters</strong></a> probabaly was born during the 1760s or perhaps earlier. 



<p>In May 1781, David Waters was apprehended by the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> and confessed to "depreciating Continental money." He was confined and later released on bail.

<p>After the war, he settled in Albany. In December 1786, he was appointed a replacement constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.  In <a href="../../census1790.html#6821">1790</a>, the census showed him alone in a third ward house. Afterwards, his house and store were <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a>  landmarks. Subsequent assessment rolls <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">taxed</a> houses, lots, and docks in several parts of the city.

<p>Living next door <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#20">by</a> 1790 was his future wife, <a href="../o/elorr6819.html">Elizabeth Orr</a> - the daughter of a recently deceased <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">newcomer</a> businessman. The marriage produced a number of children. Their family received burial services from the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>

<p>Over three decades, he was known in Albany as a merchant, grocer, landlord, and slaveholder.

<p>David Waters died in February of 1810. Elizabeth took over as head of their Market Street home and lived until 1839.</p>
