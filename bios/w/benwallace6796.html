<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Benjamin Wallace</strong></a> was born during the mid-eighteenth century. Subsequent documents identified him as from Vermont.

<p>His name first appeared on Albany rolls in October 1774 when his account was paid by the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">city government</a>. He may have been or was related to the "Benjamin Wallace" whose Cambridge District, Albany County property was taxed by New York State in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>.  

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">1781</a>, he was among the newcomers who purchased the "Freedom" of Albany. That initiative gave non natives the right to conduct business within the city of Albany. Later he received a land <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany regiment of the State <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6796">1790</a>, he was identified as the head of a third ward household. A <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">contemporary map</a> located his home on the east side of North Market Street. The city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1788tl">assessment roll</a> for 1788 placed a moderate value on his house and more value on his personal property.

<p>In November 1791, he married Peggy Quackenbush at the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a> in Albany. Their son was christened there a year later. At that time, Wallace was identified as a merchant.

<p>By the time that the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> was issued in 1813, Wallace had relocated to Court Street (South Market Street). Subsequent directories identified him as "assistant justice" and justice at several Court Street addresses. He was listed until after 1822.
