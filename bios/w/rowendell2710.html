<strong>Robert H. Wendell</strong></a> was born in February 1760. He was the son of <a href="hewendell2689.html">Hendrick J.</a> and gunsmith's daughter <a href="../l/malansing3503.html">Maria Lansing</a> Wendell. He grew up in a merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a>. His father was appointed sheriff in 1777.

<p>In his teens during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, he could be <a href="../../inprog.html">expected</a> to play an active role. Later, he would receive a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2710">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment.

<p>He probably was the "Robert Wendell" who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjobarclay.html">will</a> of Mayor John Barclay in January 1779.

<p>His wife was Agnes <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/de_fon.html">Fonda</a> of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 
They married during the early 1780s in the Schenectady Dutch church. Between 1784 and 1801, eight children were christened in Schenectady.

<p>He settled in Schenectady where he became an attorney, public figure, and later, a gentleman farmer. To fully articulate his long life beyond Albany would be beyond the <a href="../../criteria.html">scope</a> of our concern. Sorry!

<p>Robert H. Wendell lost his wife in April 1828. He died in Schenectady in July 1848. He had lived eighty-eight years.
