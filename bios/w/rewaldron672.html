<P><A href="#biography"><B>Rebecca Waldron</B></A> was born in August 1719. She was a younger daughter in the very large family of Albany businessman <a href="pwaldron668.html">Pieter Waldron</a> and his wife <a href="../vd/cavdb5740.html">Catharina Vandenbergh</a> Waldron.
 
<p>Rebecca grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where her father was emerging from the working class until his life ended prematurely in 1725. Pieter Waldron's death arrested the family's upward mobility and destined his children for a closer connection to the world of work.</p>

<P>In November 1737, she married Albany blacksmith <a href="../y/joyates4479.html">John Yates</a>. Their eight children were baptized in the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch church</a> between 1738 and 1756. She became a church pewholder in 1747.</p>

<p>Rather than establish their own Albany home, these Yateses appeared to have lived with John's parents while he acquired a farm and additional acreage across the river in Greenbush.</P>

<p>She was living when her husband wrote his <a href="../../wills/willjoyates4479.html">will</a> in 1775. Rebecca was left the Greenbush farm and was made co-executor of his estate. The date of her death is unknown!</p>
