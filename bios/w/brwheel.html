<P>Spelled and referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Bridget Wheeler</strong></a> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in May of 1696. She was the daughter of Hudson Valley residents Edward/Evert and Josina Gardenier Wheeler. She was the second daughter born to a marriage that may have produced as many as seventeen children. Her father is said to have come from New England to become a resident of <a href="../../na/khook.html">K</a>inderhook.

<p>In June 1719, Bridget married <a href="../s/joseeger7002.html">Johannes Seeger</a> at the Albany church. By 1738, the marriage had produced ten children who were christened in Albany. Both partners were regular baptism sponsors at the church as late as 1762. Her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridget_(given_name)">uncommon</a> given name stands out in the community-based record.

<p>This Seeger family made its home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Johannes was the city marshall perhaps until his death in 1769 when he was succeeded by their son <a href="../s/thseeger.html">Thomas</a>.

<p>Bridget was alive until at least August 1765 when, due to age and <a href="../../poor.html">poverty</a>, Seeger and his wife were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA159&lpg=PA159&dq=%22johannes+seager&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22johannes%20seager&f=false">granted</a> use of their present house, grounds, and property at six pence annually for the rest of their lives.

<p>Johannes Seeger was no longer found on city rolls after the 1760s. We seek definitive information on the later life and passing of Bridget Wheeler Seeger.</p>
