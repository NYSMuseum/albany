      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Edward S. Willett</b></a> was born in November 
        1750. He was the son of Samuel Willett of Flushing, Long Island. He was 
        baptized at Trinity Church in New York City in 1753. By the early 1770s, 
        he joined his older <a href="../w/elwillett6906.html">cousin</a> in Albany 
        and worked with him in the saddler's trade. Shortly after arriving, he 
        became a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican 
        church.</p>
      <p>In 1774, he married Albany native and <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> pewholder <a href="../f/safryer8139.html">Sarah Fryer</a>. 
        By 1782, the marriage had produced seven children.</p>
      <p>He then followed his <a href="../f/jofryer8034.html">father-in-law</a> 
        in the river trade - becoming a sloop captain himself by the mid-1770s. 
        At the outbreak of the war, he joined the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Revolutionary 
        cause</a> - carrying people, cargoes, and intelligence on his sloop. He 
        was trusted to transport Tories to New York for exchange and was called 
        "a gentleman of undoubted loyalty" by Governor Clinton. He then served 
        under the Quartermaster General as "<a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#6905">forage 
        master</a>" and also with an artillery company. Aftwards, he received 
        a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6905">land bounty right</a> in 
        conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.</p>
      <p>His home was on what became <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South 
        Pearl Street</a> and was located in the middle of the <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">block</a> 
        between Beaver and Hudson Streets. In 1776, he served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
        in the first ward. After the war, he was an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#6905">mainstay</a> 
        for the next three decades. During some of that time, his household included 
        <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slaves</a>. <a href="../../cbr.html">Community-based</a> 
        documents identified him as a merchant dealing in building supplies, a 
        mariner, and a saddler. He was a <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Mason</a> 
        - belonging to the <a href="../../org/masonic.html#6905">Union Lodge</a>. 
      <p>In 1788, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> 
        of his wife's brother-in-law. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6905">1800</a>, 
        his first ward home included seven members. 
      <p>Edward S. Willett died in April 1810 a few months shy of his sixtieth 
        birthday. He was buried in the Dutch church cemetery. His widow lived 
        until 1831.</p>
