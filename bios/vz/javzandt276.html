      <P><a href="#sources"> <strong>James Van Zandt</strong></a> was born (<a href="../../res/sp.html">ch</a>ristened 
        "Jacobus") in May 1765. He was the first child born to the marriage of 
        Albany residents <a href="rvzandt320.html">Ryckert</a> and <a href="../h/sahilton516.html">Sara 
        Hilton</a> Van Zandt. Also, known alternatively (and probably to avoid 
        confusion with an older <a href="javzandt275.html">same-named</a> uncle) 
        as "Jacobus R. <a href="../../res/sp.html">and/or</a> Jacobus Jun. Van 
        Zant," he was the eldest son in the large <a href="../../census1790.html#320">family</a> 
        of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> carpenter. It appears 
        that he was the older brother of Albany merchant <a href="jorvzandt298.html">Joseph 
        R. Van Zandt</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#320">1788</a>, the personal property of "Jacobus Van Sant Jun" was valued under the first ward holdings of Ryckert. In <a href="../../census1790.html#320">1790</a>, two adult men were counted within Ryckert's first ward household. 

<p>By 1793, he had married a woman named Mary (<a href="../../res/guess.html">per</a>haps a daughter of their neighbors the <a href="../h/hoog.html">Hooghkerk</a>s). Between then and 1802, at least five children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were occasional baptism sponsors.

      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and 
        personal property were valued on the first ward assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#276">1800</a>, 
        the household of "James Van Zant" in that location included two boys, two girls, and an adult 
        couple with the male a decade older. His census entry for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> 
        accounts for the growth and development of that nuclear family. 
      <p>In June <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">1806</a>, his lot near <a href="../../streets.html#hal">Hallenbake Street</a> was referenced in an Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transaction.

<p>Beginning with the first city directory in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22james+vam+zandt%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22james%20van%22zandt%22&f=false">1813</a>, his address was given as 58 Washington and then 62 <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#2">South Pearl Street</a> and his occupation listed as <a href="../../trades/wood.html">cooper</a>. After 1815, his name no longer appeared in the city directory nor in the community-based resources thus far encountered.

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Albany resident James Van Zandt who would have been about fifty years old in 1815.</p>
