<strong>Anna Van Zandt</strong></a> was born in May 1693. She was an older daughter in the large family of Albany mainstays <a href="jojavzandt291.html">Joseph Janse</a> and <a href="../m/zmarselis853.html">Zytie Marselis</a> Van Zandt. She grew up in Albany's <a href="../../census1697.html#043">first ward</a> in an ethnically diverse neighborhood that included the family of her future husband.</p>

<p>She was almost thirty-one-years-old in January 1724 when she married a slightly older <a href="../r/laradcliff1077.html">Lambert Radcliff</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a long-time pewholder and regular baptism sponsor. Despite her age, by 1735 Anna had given birth to six children.

<p>These Radcliffs also lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> - close to their kin in both families. Lambert was a tradesman who also owned a brickyard.


<p>Anna Van Zandt Radcliff was last heard from in 1751. Her husband was alive during the mid-1760s.</p>
