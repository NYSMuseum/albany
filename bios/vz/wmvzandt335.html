<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Van Zandt</strong></a> was born in September 1725. He was an the second surviving son in the large family of Albany natives <a href="jovzandt281.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../h/sahilton.html">Sara Hilton</a> Van Zandt. He grew up in the home of a prominent weaver on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South Side</a> of Albany - also the neighborhood of a <a href="../../census1756.html#185">number</a> of Van Zandt households.

<p>By the early 1750s, he had married <a href="../s/alsmith.html">Alida Smith</a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Swits). By 1772, eight children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1753">1753</a>, and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1774">1774</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the first ward. William was a <a href="../../census1756.html#197">shoemaker</a> and mainline resident for the next thirty years. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>, a <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#335">freeholder</a>, and assessment rolls show this <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">homeowner</a> living among a number of Van Zandt households. 

<p>Aged fifty at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, William Van Zandt seems to only have offered financial support to the Revolutionary cause.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#335">1779</a>, his first ward property was accorded a middling assessment. 

<p>William Van Zandt was dead by the end of August 1785 when his lot and heirs were referenced by the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">Common Council</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#als">1788</a>, his widow was the owner of record and their adult son was listed there as well.</p>
