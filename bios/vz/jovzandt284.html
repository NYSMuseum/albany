<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John W. Van Zandt</strong></a> was born in August 1757. He was the eldest son of Willem and Alida Swits Van Zandt. He was known as John W. to help distinguish him from same-<a href="../bioindex.html#vz">named</a> contemporaries. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> of Albany surrounded by a number of family homes.

<p>Coming of age during the late 1770s, we expect to find <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> information on him as several "JVZs" were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">recognized</a> in military service records.
 
<p>In November 1780, he married Elizabeth Van Zandt at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She apparently died without bearing children. In October 1782, he married Margarita Burgiss also at the Albany church. By 1799, seven children from the second marriage had been christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1786">1786</a>, he was named a chimney viewer for the first ward.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#284">1788</a>, his house and lot in the first ward, were valued on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#284">1790</a>, his second ward household included husband, wife, and two children.

<p>After that, his name <a href="../../inprog.html">seems</a> to have dropped from the community-based record thus far encountered.
   
<p>John W. Van Zandt died in May 1829 at Watervliet. His will passed probate a month later.</p>
