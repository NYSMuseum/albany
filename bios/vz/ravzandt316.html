<strong>Rachel Van Zandt</strong></a> was born in August 1764. She was the eldest daughter of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents <a href="gyvzandt268.html">Gysbert</a> and <a href="../w/rewinne3111.html">Rebecca Winne</a> Van Zandt. She grew up in a carpenter's home in what became the town of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Be</a>thlehem.

<p>In January 1786, Rachel married Albany native <a href="../y/heyates4413.html">Henry Yates</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1803, eight children had been christened in Albany.
<p>These Yateses raised their family in a modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Henry was a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> mainstay until his death between 1810 and 1813.

<p>By 1813, Rachel was a widow and the head of a household at 22 <a href="../../streets.html">Green Street</a>. She remained at that address for a number of years. By <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1820</a>, she was sharing a residence with her son, Henry H. Yates, at his home around the corner at 40 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. She lived there until at least 1830. Her father appears to have lived with her until his death in March 1824 at the age of ninety-one. Beyond that, we seek information on her later life.

<p>Rachel Van Zandt Yates died in April 1846 and was buried in the church plot. She had lived for more than eighty years.</p>
