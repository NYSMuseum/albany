<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Van Zandt</b></a> probably <a href="http://www.eancestry.org/getperson.php?personID=I10447&tree=nichols">was</a> the son of Adam and Jannetje Van Zandt. Traditional <a href="#sources">sources</a> state that he had been born in Arnhem in 1657 and that he emigrated to America sometime afterwards. Some sources also that he was the brother of Albany mainstay <a href="jojavzandt291.html">Joseph Janse Van Zandt</a> - but now we are not so sure!</p>

<p>By 1682, he had married <a href="../../bios/vd/mgtvdp6262.html">Margarita Vanderpoel</a> of Albany. Their eleven children were born before 1704. Some of them were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. During the 1680s and 90s, he was paid by the church for services including making a coffin for a "praying Indian boy."</p>

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html">1689</a>, his (Johannes Van Sante) modest holdings were valued on the city assessment roll in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. During that time, he served as a constable and juror. In 1688, he was appointed high constable.</p> 

<p>At different times, he was called a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">turner</a>, carpenter, and <a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">yeoman</a>.</p>

<p>About 1693, he moved his family to New York City while <a href="jojavzandt291.html">Joseph Janse</a> remained in Albany where he would be <a href="../../census1697.html#043">identified</a> as of Spanish origins.

<p>Over the next years, Johannes Van Zandt became a well known businessman in New York and its environs. Some of his accounts with the province are summarized <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ggQKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1007&lpg=PA1007&dq=johannes+van+zandt+new+york&source=bl&ots=gMJwvbpn0m&sig=YoExD5_IpsuXWrVG5T4G5KqDyM0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRltavtrPUAhWFdD4KHUE4Cbc4ChDoAQg5MAY#v=onepage&q=johannes%20van%20zandt%20new%20york&f=false">online</a>. 

<p>In September 1724, Johannes Van Zandt was living in Newtown Queens when he wrote a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wyw8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA301&lpg=PA301&dq=%22queens+county,+yeoman,+being+sick%22+van+zandt&source=bl&ots=Qmt1che8Fr&sig=eOgDetzOiLPO5yMYpU-rbVJbBs4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji1e-Vg7HUAhUFOD4KHd02AhUQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=%22queens%20county%2C%20yeoman%2C%20being%20sick%22%20van%20zandt&f=false">will</a>. Calling himself a <a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">Yeo</a>man, and stating that he was sick, he left personal effects and an annuity to his wife and divided his property including his slaves among his living children. Eldest son <a href="wyvzandt339.html">Wynant</a> was named executor but left only a nominal birthright. The will passed probate on November 9, 1724.</p>
