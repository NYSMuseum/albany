<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Van Zandt</b></a> was born in 1690 and was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on August 3. He was the son of <a href="jovzandt280.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../vd/mgtvdp6262.html">Margarita Vanderpoel</a> Van Zandt. A few years, later his father re-located the family to New York City and then Long Island where Johannes Sr. died in 1724. However, Johannes Jr's. life would play out on an early Albany stage.</p>


<p>In May 1718, he married Albany native <a href="../h/sahilton.html">Sara Hilton</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1738, eleven children had been christened in Albany where he was a lifelong pewholder. In 1762, he had a seat in the "Old Men's pew."</p>

<p>These Van Zandts lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Johannes was a member of a small but prominent enclave of <a href="../../trades/weaver.html">weavers</a>.  In 1717, he began to acquire additional lots in the first ward. His name appeared first ward voter lists in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#281">1720</a> and 1742 and he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.</p>

<p>After serving as constable in 1717 and 1718, in 1750, he was elected alderman in the first ward. He was re-elected in each of the next nine years - serving the decade of his sixties on the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a>. 


<p>Johannes Van Zandt lost his wife in 1743. But as his sons reached adulthood and daughters married sons of neighboring families, his home was a <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">Southside</a> <a href="../../census1756.html#185">landmark</a>. He probably died during the 1760s!</p>
