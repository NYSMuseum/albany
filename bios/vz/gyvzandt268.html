      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gysbert Van Zandt</strong></a> was born 
        in March 1734. He was a younger son in the large family of <a href="jovzandt281.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../h/sahilton.html">Sara Hilton</a> Van Zandt. He grew up 
        in a weaver's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
        His mother died when he was nine so he most likely was raised by an aging 
        father and his <a href="anvzandt239.html">ol</a>der <a href="savzandt322.html">si</a>sters. 
      <p>In October 1759, he married Rensselaerswyck native <a href="../w/rewinne3111.html">Rebecca 
        Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1780, eight children had been christened in Albany where he was a perwholder 
        and occasional baptism sponsor. 
      <p>Gysbert was a carpenter who made his home in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West 
        Manor</a> and also held a separate lot there. In <a href="../../census1790.html#268">1790</a>, 
        his Watervliet household (he was called Gilbert) included two men, four 
        females, and three slaves. In 1800, the census taker probably found him 
        in the newly formed town of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. 
      <p>In March 1784, he was identified as a part owner of a sloop in the <a href="../../wills/willabvplanck1102.html">will</a> 
        of mariner Abraham Verplanck. 
      <p>Gysbert Van Zandt died in March 1824 at the age of ninety-one. He was 
        buried from the house of his grandson and widowed <a href="ravzandt316.html">daughter</a> 
        at 40 Hudson Street in Albany. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> 
        passed probate shortly thereafter.</p>
