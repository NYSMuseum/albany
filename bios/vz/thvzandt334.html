<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Van Zandt</strong></a> was born  in September 1763. He was the son of <a href="jovzandt282.html">John</a> and <a href="../w/mgtwilk6892.html">Margarita Wilkeson</a> Van Zandt. He grew up a middle child in the very large (15 births) family of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside weaver.

<p>Perhaps he was one of the two men listed on the census in 1790 under his father's <a href="../../census1790.html#282">household</a>. Two years earlier, the first ward assessment roll valued <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#334">Thomas J.'s</a> personal property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> just under John Van Zandt's personal holdings. 

<p>In February 1792, he married his childhood neighbor <a href="../h/rehoog3613.html">Rebecca Hooghkerk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1804, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Van Zandts made their home on the west side what became <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> from where Thomas plied the <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">mason's trade</a>. The census in <a href="../../census1800.html#334">1800</a> showed the couple, three young children, and probably his widowed mother in their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22zandt+thomas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22zandt%20thomas&22&f=false">1813</a>, this modest mason's home at 43 Washington (South Pearl) Street was one of ten Van Zandt homes included in the city directory. It sat on the northwestern corner with Plain Street. He also <a href="../../res/realestate.html">owned</a> additional <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc15213.htm">property</a> in that part of Albany.

<p>Thomas Van Zandt was dead by 1818, when his widow was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 43 South Pearl. She lived on until July 1855. Both partners were finally <a href="http://www.user1.netcarrier.com/~muriel/VanZandtSociety/cemetary.htm">interred</a> at the Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
