<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Wynant Van Zandt</strong></a> was born in December of 1683. He was the eldest son of <a href="jovzandt280.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../vd/mgtvdp6262.html">Margarita  Vanderpoel</a> Wynant began life in the third ward <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#3">home</a> of an elite woodworker. During the 1690s, Johannes Van Zandt relocated his family to New York City and then to Queens where he died in 1724.

<p>In June 1710, he married one Catherine Ten Eyck at the Dutch church of New York. At the time of his death, he appears to have been married to a woman named Catherine and to have raised a large family. Perhaps he had been <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Van_Zandt-43#Marriage">married previously</a> - or a same-named contemporary is at risk in the region..
 
<p>Wynant Van Zandt was bequeathed his birthright and made executor in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wyw8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA301&lpg=PA301&dq=%22queens+county,+yeoman,+being+sick%22+van+zandt&source=bl&ots=Qmt1che8Fr&sig=eOgDetzOiLPO5yMYpU-rbVJbBs4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji1e-Vg7HUAhUFOD4KHd02AhUQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=%22queens%20county%2C%20yeoman%2C%20being%20sick%22%20van%20zandt&f=false">will</a> filed by his father in 1724.

<p>A substantial <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/wynant-van-zandt-1683-1757">portrait</a> of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Wynant dated about 1723 bears further investigation. A companion portrait for his wife has yet to be defined.

<p>"Wynant Van Zandt, of New York, blockmaker" filed a<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4E4zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22wynant+van+zandt+of+new+york+blockmaker%22&source=bl&ots=Tljp2dC1GU&sig=WdZG7vKdtc7TniIesaNaEFTAv00&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigt_qEv7PUAhWFeT4KHWB2A_0Q6AEIKDAB#v=onepage&q=%22wynant%20van%20zandt%20of%20new%20york%20blockmaker%22&f=false"> will</a> in December 1753. It left his entire estate to his wife Catherine and then to their children. The will passed probate in November 1757.

<p>Albany native Wynant Van Zandt is said to have died in <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Wynant-van-Zandt-I/6000000007097674288">1757</a> or <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4JvSsT6J6qoC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=johannes+van+zandt+new+york&source=bl&ots=zl7Zg-BqQP&sig=RBm9xZWsCztABovNgTa1nI8NuNY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiRltavtrPUAhWFdD4KHUE4Cbc4ChDoAQg8MAc#v=snippet&q=wynant%20van%20zandt&f=false">1763</a>. The material presented <a href="../../res/context.html">here</a> probably represents the tip of the resource iceberg as this individual spent the majority of his life in downriver New York.</p>
