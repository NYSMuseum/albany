      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit Van Zandt, Jr.</strong></a> was born 
        in January 1731. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="jovzandt281.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../h/sahilton.html">Sara Hilton</a> Van Zandt. He grew up 
        in a large family in a weaver's home on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>. 
        The existence of a number of similarly named contemporaries complicates 
        the assignment of qualitative life information. 
      <p>About 1755, he married <a href="../w/hewinne2930.html">Hester Winne</a>. 
        By 1762, three children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a member, pewholder, regular baptism sponsor, 
        and, at the end of his life, a church <a href="../../wills/willgevzandt263.html#poor">benefactor</a>. 
      <p>Like many members of his family, Gerrit Jr. also lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. Although, before his death, he would own <a href="../../wills/willgevzandt263.html">ex</a>tensive 
        <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> in Albany and beyond, 
        his individual <a href="#1779">holdings</a> appear to have been of modest 
        value. Not until <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, did 
        his house receive a valuation comparable to that of other Albany business 
        people. However, his Albany lots, especially south of State Street, were 
        numerous. Perhaps, his mill on the Onesquethaw Creek occupied a larger 
        share of his energy. 
<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1752">1752</a>, he was chosen constable for the first ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>, he was listed among the city's firemen. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1770">1770</a>, he was elected assistant alderman. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1772">1772</a>, he was elected alderman and served in that capacity until the suspension of the charter government after 1775. An unofficial <a href="../../sources.html#jp">observer</a> stated that he was the city <a href="../../corporation.html">recorder</a> in 1774. Throughout that time he was paid by the city for goods and services.

<p>In his mid-forties at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-be.html">1775</a>, we should expect to be able to document his activities during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">W</a>ar for Independence. We move cautiously in this <a href="../../res/sp.html">area</a>. However, he had <a href="http://catalog.cdlc.org/cgi-bin/koha/opac-MARCdetail.pl?biblionumber=136902">succeeded</a> his uncle as "Deputy Commissary of Stores and Provisions" for the crown - probably after 1773.

<p>In 1760, he <a href="../../inprog.html">composed</a> a Dutch-language 
        tribute to the new minister, Reverend <a href="../w/ewesterlo.html">Eilardus 
        Westerlo</a>. During the 1770s, he was known as a land sales and lottery 
        manager. Not until <a href="../../census1800.html#263">1800</a>, was his 
        substantial Albany residence (probably along <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">Washington</a> 
        Street - near that of Philip Schuyler) configured on the first ward census. 
        In that year, he and Hester were alone in the house but were served by 
        four slaves. Previously, he had bought and sold <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dQP3qrougnkC&pg=PR7&lpg=PR7&dq=%22gerrit+van+zandt%22&source=bl&ots=qGfJRCd9j7&sig=OYefd9EaDOBhqK7bDkDRnJtcVBE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=J6kDUuL4Hc-z4APpyoCQDw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22gerrit%20van%20zandt%22&f=false">slaves</a> 
        on a number of occasions. 
      <p>Gerrit Van Zandt, Jr. filed a <a href="../../wills/willgevzandt263.html">will</a> 
        in April 1806. It detailed his extensive holdings. He died in July 1806 
        at the age of seventy-six. The newspaper called him a "respectable citizen." 
        His will passed probate in August. His widow survived until 1813.</p>

        <p><a name=1779>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">1779</a>, at 
          least four parcels in the city were owned by "Gerrit Van Zandt." None 
          of them valued personal property only the land itself. However, several 
          Gerrits are at risk for that time period.
