<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ryckert Van Zandt</b></a> was born in 1735. He was the eldest surviving son of businessman <a href="gevzandt261.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../vd/anvdb5725.html">Anna Vandenbergh</a> Van Zandt. He grew up on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">south side</a> of Albany in the heart of the city's center of <a href="../../makers.html">trades and crafts</a>.</p>

<p>He married his young neighbor, <a href="../h/sahilton516.html">Sara Hilton</a>, in January 1765. Their first child was born a few months later. Over the next twenty-five years, eight children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>Ryckert Van Zandt was an Albany mainstay. He earned a living as a carpenter and repair man while performing contract services for the city government. He served as a constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> and as a member of the provincial 
<a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. His <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#320">home</a> was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#320">valued</a> on first ward assessments for the rest of his life.</p>

      <p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>, he actually 
        served in the Albany militia regiment, repaired water pumps and performed 
        other services for the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>, 
        contributed money to the war effort, and, in 1780, was held back from 
        military service because he was a carpenter. 
      <p>The end of the war found him at work as a contractor and administering the city lots inherited from his father. In <a href="../../census1790.html#320">1790</a>, his <a href="../../streets.html#green">Green Street</a> household included eight family members. The first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in 1813 gave his address as "19 Green Street."</p> 

<p>Ryckert Van Zandt died in June 1814 at age seventy-eight. His will passed probate a week later. His widow lived on in their Green Street home until her death in 1830.</p>
