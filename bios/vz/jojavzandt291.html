<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">traditional sources</a>, <a href="#sources"><b>Joseph Janse</b></a> was born in Spain in 1663. He probably was the son of Jan and Jannet. Perhaps his father was a Spanish soldier recruited to suppress Dutch Protestants. As he later was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a>, he probably had been born in Europe. He was known as "Joseph Janse"  and later took the surname "Van Zandt" probably meaning "from" or "of the Saints." However, other derivative explanations have been offered. He most likely is the patriarch of the Albany <a href="vzandt.html">Van Zandt</a> family.

      <p>In 1688, he married <a href="../../bios/m/zmarselis853.html">Zytie Marselis</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a 
        lifelong member. Their ten children were baptized there between 1689 and 
        1709. In 1692, the church paid "Josep de Spaniert" for the rental of his 
        house. In 1699, his name appeared on a list of the "principal members 
        of the church."</p>

In <a href="../../census1697.html#043">1697</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder and of Spanish origins! As he was an outsider, he experienced some difficulty - being brought to court several times for <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> without a license.<p></p>

      <p>By the early 1700s, he had become a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first</a> ward <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#291">mainstay</a>. In December 1715, he became a <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> British subject. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, "Joseph Janse" was a member of an <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> company and later took care to <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#291">qualify</a> to vote.</p> 

<p>Joseph Janse Van Zandt lived out his life on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">southside</a>. "Joseph Jans Van zante" died in October 1753 and was buried in the Albany churchyard.
