<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Rachel Van Zandt</strong></a> was born in May 1759. She was the daughter of <a href="gevzandt263.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../w/hewinne2930.html">Hester Winne</a> Van Zandt. She grew up in a small family in the <a href="../../census1800.html#263">home</a> of a first ward businessman, city officer, and property holder. Her father also owned a mill and farm on a creek <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">south</a> of Albany.

<p>In November 1782, she married <a href="../b/jableecker194.html">Jacobus Bleecker</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1790, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>This Bleecker <a href="../../census1790.html#222">family</a> joined the others on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> from where Jacob/James Bleecker, Jr. followed business and real estate interests. In <a href="../../census1800.html#194">1800</a>, their home was served by four slaves.  

<p>In 1806, Rachel was the only living child and was well provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willgevzandt263.html">will</a> filed by her father. Her legacy included substantial Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>. Her three living children were to receive substantial bequests as well.

<p>James/Jacob Bleecker, Jr. died at the end of 1808. Subsequent <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22bleecker+widow+49%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22bleecker%20widow+49%22&f=false">city directories</a> showed "Widow Bleecker" in their town house at 49 Pearl Street. By 1820, her name had dropped from the directory listings.

<p>Rachel Van Zandt Bleecker <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267&dq=%22march 22%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22march 22%22&f=false"">died</a> on March 22, 1837 and was buried from the house of her son, Gerrit.
