<strong>Jacobus Van Zandt</strong></a> was born in November 1732. He was a middle child in the large family of <a href="jovzandt281.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../h/sahilton.html">Sara Hilton</a> Van Zandt. He grew up in a prominent <a href="../../census1756.html#185">weaver's</a> home on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany but lost his mother in 1743. Johannes Van Zandt did not re-marry but his numerous offspring could count on the care and protection of an extended family network in a neighborhood setting. By the time his father passed on in 1762, Jacobus and his siblings were well-represented in the city's crafts <a href="../../makers.html">and</a> trades. 

<p>In December 1758, Jacobus married <a href="../b/mabrooks351.html">Maria (Molly) Brooks</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Between 1762 and 1767, two children had been christened at the Albany church. 

<p>Jacobus Van Zandt was a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a> who took his place in the community when he was appointed constable in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1756">1756</a>. His clients included the city of Albany. His home was located in the heart of the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> neighborhood.  He also owned property on the <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">hill</a> above what became <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">S</a>outh Pearl Street. From the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a> until his death, his first ward holdings were valued modestly on city assessment rolls. During the 1760s, he was a sergaent in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>During the wartime years, his actions mostly ran below our community-based radar except that he <a href="../../cddc.html">appeared </a>as a bailsman in 1781 and was paid on occasion from the city treasury. He probably was not the same-named individual <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8qlCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA501&lpg=PA501&dq=%22james+van+zant%22+albany&source=bl&ots=ur1tFVo-1a&sig=v1nzfOrrCuKJR67ki5l_hYwyTxM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjsys376Y3TAhWJgFQKHXCKBpgQ6AEISjAJ#v=onepage&q=%22james%20van%20zant%22%20albany&f=false">under suspicion</a> by the Albany Commissioners. Afterwards, Jacobus was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#275">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>After the war, he was called on to appraise some property for the city government.  In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#275">1788</a>, his property was assessed for taxes. Two years <a href="../../census1790.html#275">later</a>, his household included four members. At that time, he was among those <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#275">indebted</a> to the estate of his one-time neighbor,  Dr. Henry Van Dyck. 

<p>Jacobus Van Zandt died in November 1795 just short of his sixty-third birthday. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in June 1799. His widow carried on in their Union Street home until her death in 1814. His <a href="jovzandt286.html">son</a> became a notable banker.
