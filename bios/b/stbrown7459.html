<P>According to family-based <a href="http://albanyhilltowns.com/wikiBio/index.php?title=Brown,_Andrew">resources</a>, future Albany businessman <a href="#sources"><strong>Stanton Brown</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">occ</a>asionally "Staunton") was born in April 1774. Thus, he would have been the second son of Andrew and Sara Chapman Brown. He grew up in a large family living  in Stonington, Connecticut. 

<p>He probably came to Albany with his older brother and lifelong business partner <a href="edbrown7449.html">Edward Brown</a>. By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the house, lot, and store of "Edward & Stanton Brown" were valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment. In 1800-01, the brothers were licensed as grocers. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, their lot on <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a> was valued modestly.

<p>This Yankee <a href="../../yankinv.html">new</a>comer does not appear to have married but probably was counted on the census of 1800 within the household of his brother. At that time, another [?] same-named individual was profiled on the census in Washington County. Other regional contemporaries are at-risk as well. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the Albany household headed by "Stanton Brown" included a couple both born between 1766 and 1784, a girl under 10, and an older woman. Perhaps this individual had married a few years earlier.  

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22stanton+brown%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=stanton%20brown&f=false">1813</a> and '14, he was an <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a> in the first ward. In 1813 and '14, he was listed in the city directory as a merchant at <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22staunton+brown%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=staunton%20brown&f=false">82 Hudson</a> with a store at 1 Hudson. That address was where the Browns appear to have conducted their business from "the first brick house on the dock" built by Edward Brown. 
 
<p>Stanton Brown was dead by June 1814 when his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in Albany. He had lived for less than forty years. Edward Brown lived on until 1846.</p>
