<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Boyd</strong></a> was born in Scotland in 1742. He does not seem to be closely related to the family of Albany resident <a href="joboyd7399.html">John Boyd</a> who also had a son named James. A number of same-named individuals seem to have lived in North America during the lifetime of this individual.

<p>We seek information on his emigration and on his arrival in Albany - perhaps about the time of the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-be.html">1775</a>. He may have been the James Boyd who served in the Third Regiment of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.
	  
<p>About 1776, he married Jane Mc Master. Between 1777 and 1788, a number of their children were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 

<p>This individual became an Albany resident. However, his name has not been found in the community based record until September 1778, when he <a href="../../cddc.html">posted bail</a> for <a href="../vw/janvwoert2606.html">Widow Clement</a> and for himself the following June. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7389">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet and was listed next to the Cherry Hill household of <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a>. Shortly thereafter, he settled permanently within the Albany city limits. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7389">1800</a>, the first ward census showed that his household included four slaves.

<p>He was a member, deacon, elder, and trustee of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>This James Boyd was a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a>. In 1796, he established the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/FindingAids/BOYD%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20MG%2082.pdf">Arch Street Brewery</a> - which later became the "Albany Brewing Company." Beginning about 1815, he was one of those who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=B_M7vlQPa8kC&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=%22james+boyd%22+&source=bl&ots=LLYvGpSaEh&sig=hY9efnNEzM374aO-tBLkIR6d2kQ&hl=en&ei=FHiaS9SmFcL38AaXpLydDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CA0Q6AEwBDgo#v=onepage&q=%22james%20boyd%22%20&f=false">built</a> a number of brick buildings on South Ferry Street across the street from his brewery. His sons ultimately lived in those homes.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22boyd+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22boyd%20james%22&f=false">1813</a>, city directories listed his Ferry Street residence and also his brewery partnerships.


  
<p>James Boyd died in August 1832 at the age of ninety. His funeral was conducted from his home at 72 Ferry Street. His will passed probate later that month.</p>
