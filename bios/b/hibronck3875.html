<strong>Hilletie Bronck</strong></a> was born about 1690. She may have been the daughter of Jan Bronck.


<p>In June 1712, she became the second wife of innkeeper <a href="../w/thwilliams.html">Thomas Williams</a> - a widower with several children. By 1724, six more children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>Hilletie raised their large, combined family in Williams' <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> establishment. Her responsibilities may have reached beyond the domestic as her husband was frequently away from their home on business as attorney, sheriff, and Indian commissioner.


<p>Thomas Williams died in 1752. Perhaps Widow Hilletie lived at one of the inns run by her stepsons - <a href="../w/edwilliams6296.html">Edward</a> or <a href="../w/thwilliams6326.html">Thomas</a> - or with her son, <a href="../w/pewilliams6319.html">Peter</a>, an Albany tailor.

<p>Hilletie Bronck Williams died in May 1758 and was buried from her church.</p>
