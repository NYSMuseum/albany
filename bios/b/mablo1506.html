<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Maas Bloomendal, Jr.</strong></a> was born in August 1733. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jablo1479.html">Jacob Maase</a> and his wife, <a href="../g/sagardinier.html">Sara Gardinier</a> Maase. He was called "Jr." to prevent confusion with his older <a href="mablo1504.html">cousin</a>, a Rensselaerswyck farmer who also had ties to Albany.

<p>Maas Jr. grew up in a small family that lost its head when Jacob Maase died in 1755. In 1761, he was <a href="../../wills/willcoblo1464.html">left</a> a share of his uncle's Albany house (where he was then living with his brother, <a href="albloom1455.html">Albertus</a>) and other property as well.

<p>During the 1750s, Maas Jr. married <a href="../s/hescher5462.html">Helena Schermerhorn</a>. Between 1759 and 1775, their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where his wife was a pewholder and he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Bloomendals set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Maas Jr. worked as a brazier - the family trade probably taught to him by his father and uncles. Assessment rolls <ahref="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">valued</a> his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1506">home</a>,  located near the State Street landmark of <a href="../t/jacte4881.html">Jacob C. Ten Eyck</a>, quite modestly.

<p>He served as <a href="../../org/cc.html#1757">fi</a>remaster and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1757">co</a>nstable and in the provincial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> as well. 

<p>At this point, we are unwilling to assign much of the existing information for "Maas Bloomendal" for the era of the American Revolution. However, we believe he did receive a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1506">bounty right</a> for wartime service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.
<p>With the death of his older cousin by 1790, we are more certain that Maas Bloomendal, Jr. was a brazier and a mainline <a href="../../census1790.html#1506">resident</a> of the first ward for at least the next decade. 

<p>He last was heard from in <a href="../../census1800.html#1506">1800</a> when the census described his household with only an elderly man and woman as residents.</p>
