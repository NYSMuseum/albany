<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Martha Bennewe</strong></a> was born in the summer of 1707. She was the daughter of <a href="pierreben.html">Pierre</a> and <a href="../vs/hevschoon5895.html">Hendrickie Van Schoonhoven</a> Bennewe.

<p>In February 1725, she married Albany native <a href="../r/wmradcliff1194.html">William Radcliff</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Two months later, the first of four children was christened at the Albany church where she joined her husband as a baptism sponsor. Radcliff died following a head injury in February 1734. That October, she married <a href="../o/rioliver.html">Richard Oliver</a>. By 1742, four more children had been christened in Albany. Perhaps it was her second husband's first marriage.

      <p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#48">1756</a>, Oliver's "dramshop" residence 
        was described on a census of Albany householders taken by the British 
        army. Over the next years, Richard and Martha witnessed baptisms at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Anglican church. 
      <p>Martha Bennewe Radcliff Oliver had passed on by September 1763 when Oliver 
        remarried at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</p>
