<P>Known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously and as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sephrenus Besinger</strong></a>, in May 1767 this individual was <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#sebe">listed</a> on the roster of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company under the command of Captain <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham C. Cuyler</a>. Obviously, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>Perhaps he was the "Sefrenes Bassinger" who is <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/sefrenes-bassinger_24589655?geo_a=r&o_iid=41018&o_lid=41018&o_sch=Web+Property">said</a> to have been born in Stone Arabia in the Mohawk Valley in 1748.

<p>In September 1773, New York <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BfEpAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA476&lpg=PA476&dq=Safereenus+Bessinger&source=bl&ots=nwb03XTgc_&sig=zFrbizSGQMTgIPKLGTzEEdcb2kA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0jMDPk4nLAhUDcT4KHSSCDekQ6AEIKTAC#v=onepage&q=Safereenus%20Bessinger&f=false">marriage bonds</a> were issued to "Safereenus <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/BAYSINGER/2002-06/1024752471">Bessinger</a> and Mary Young." Family-based sources have <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/fs/4:1:2ZKP-3QV">noted</a> that his marriage to Young/Jung produced seven or more children.

      <p>At this point, we have not connected his life to early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
        Nor have we encountered additional, <a href="../../res/guess.html">likely</a> 
        biographical information. 
      <p>Perhaps he was the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary war veteran "Sefrenes Basinger" who died on May 20, 1830 and was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=117672247&amp;ref=acom">buried</a> in the town of Springfield, Otsego County. 

<p>Once we can <a href="../../res/sp.html">decode</a> the representation of his name we may be able to move forward with more confidence on the life of the one-time Albany militia member known as "Sephrenus Besinger."</p>

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Despite his faint presence on the community landscape, I admit to being intrigued by this curiously named (maybe Zepharinah or Bellinger or Pa/essenger) individual who may well be of <a href="../ger.html#pal">Palatine</a> origins.
