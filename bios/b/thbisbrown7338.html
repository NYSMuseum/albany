<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Thomas Bisbrown</strong></a> probably was born during the 1760s. 

<p>In September 1789, he married surveyor's daughter Mary (or Margaret) Campbell at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. Without children christened in Albany churches, the marriage may have been childless.

<p>His name first appeared in Albany annals in November 1787 when the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> noted he was a clockmaker working at 8 Market Street. His Market Street household was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#7338">1790</a>. In February 1793, he was identified as the husband of Margaret Campbell in the will of her <a href="../c/arcampbell7528.html">father</a>.

<p>The location of Bisbrown's Market Street home was shown on a <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">street map</a> drawn in 1790.
 
<p>Thomas Bisbrown did not stay in Albany. Within a decade, he <a href="../../res/ts.html">reputedly</a> re-located to Schenectady and then to Nova Scotia where his wife died in 1812.
