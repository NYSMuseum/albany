<strong>Robert Barret</strong></a> was born in November 1714. He was the son of <a href="thbarret7220.html">Thomas</a> and <a href="../s/baspoor6525.html">Barentie Spoor</a> <a href="../../res/sp.html">B</a>arret. Sometimes, he was referred to as "Robert Barret, Jr." 

<p>In April 1738, he married <a href="../m/mamartin.html">Maria Martin</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By the time of Maria's death in 1754, six of their children had been christened  at Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>Although he was appointed firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1741">1741</a> and was listed as a <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#7233">freeholder</a> living in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> in 1742, this Robert Barret made only a slight impression on the city record. Perhaps he had been living in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home of <a href="../../census1756.html#182">Mrs. Barret</a> - a baker.


<p>Robert Barret lost his wife in December 1754. He died in October 1756 - a month shy of his forty-second birthday. Both burials were noted in the Dutch church records.</p>
