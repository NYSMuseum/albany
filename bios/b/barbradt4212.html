<strong>Barent Bradt</strong></a> was born in May 1687. He was the son of <a href="anbbradt4197.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../e/wiegb4544.html">Willempie Teunis</a>  Bradt. His father was an affluent processor and businessman with <a href="bradt.html">family</a> connections throughout the Albany area.</p>

<p>In December 1714, he married thirty-one-year-old <a href="../r/maryckman1980.html">Maria Ryckman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. That marriage produced two children before her untimely death. In August 1730, he married <a href="../m/elmarselis697.html">Elizabeth Marselis</a>. Their child was born in 1731. He was the long-time sexton of the Dutch church and an active member of the congregation.

<p>He was a bookeeper and Albany-based business officer (including his father's old position as Albany <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">treasurer</a> - first in 1722) during the first half of the eighteenth century. His name appeared on several <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">freeholder lists</a>, he belonged to Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> companies, and he was elected assistant alderman beginning in 1721. His <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home was an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#299">landmark</a>. 

<p>In August 1765, he signed a deposition testifiying that he was about 78 years old and that he had held the office of church clerk for the past thirty-six years. Barent Bradt died sometime after 1765.</p>
