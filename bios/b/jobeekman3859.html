<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Beekman</b></a> was born in January 1684. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Martense</a> and his first wife, <a href="../s/macscher5483.html">Machtelt Schermerhorn</a> Beekman. His father re-married when Johannes was eight. By 1710, nine more children would become part of his immediate family.</p>


<p>In January 1714, he married <a href="../w/heswendell2691.html">Esther Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1722, their three children had been christened at the church where he was a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Johannes Beekman, Jr. was a <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> who, after a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3859">time</a> in the first ward, set up his <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3859">home</a> on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. He owned additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> in the city. He served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and also as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In a relatively short career, he was a second ward mainstay.</p>

<p>In 1728, he was left a share of his father's <a href="../../wills/willjombeekman3858.html">estate</a> that was divided among a widow and twelve living children. Included in that bequest, was a share in his father's holdings at <a href="../../na/kayad.html">Kayaderosseras</a>.</p>

<p>Stating that he was "very sick," Johannes Beekman, Jr. filed a <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3859.html">will</a> in July 1731. He died in February 1741 and was buried from the Albany church. The will passed probate in January 1743.</p>
