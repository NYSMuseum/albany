<strong>Nicholas Bleecker</strong></a> was born in December 1677. He was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="jjbleecker2.html">Jan Janse</a> and <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">Margarita Van Woert</a> Bleecker.


<p>Like his brother, Hendrick, this Nicholas Bleecker never married. However, his life was much more historically visible than most bachelors. He probably was accounted for in his father's household on the census in <a href="../../census1697.html#147">1697</a>. Two years later, he joined with his neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#219">swearing</a> allegiance to the king of England.

<p>Nicholas was a merchant who lived in his own house near the other Bleeckers in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> His holdings were accorded a moderate <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#219">assessment</a>.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1701">1701</a>, he served the community as constable, juror, <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia officer</a>, and was elected <a href="../../org/cc.html#1716">assistant</a> alderman in the second ward first in 1716.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#219">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">1742</a>, his name appeared on list of second ward freeholders. After 1742, the name of Nicholas Bleecker no longer appeared on Albany rolls. In 1756, Rutger Janse Bleecker's <a href="../../wills/willrjbleecker227.html">will</a> stated that he had inherited property through the <a href="#will">will</a> of his brother, Nicholas Bleecker.</p>
