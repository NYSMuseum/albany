<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jan Albertse</b></a> was born in Europe during the early 1630s. He was brought to New Netherland by his parents, <a href="albanbradt4180.html">Albert Andriesse</a> and <a  href="anbarents.html">Anna Barents</a> Bradt, in 1637. He grew up on the family farm along the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Normanskill</a> at at other Bradt properties in what became Albany.</p>


<p>His wife was Brazillian native <a href="../p/mapost2221.html">Maria Post</a>. Their family was large but not entirely accounted for in the baptism records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#4188">1679</a>, Jan Albertse Bradt was identified as an Albany householder. In 1683, a list of contributors to the Dutch church stated that he lived "outside the north gate."</p>

<p>He probabaly died just after witnessing a baptism in May 1697 as his widow was identified as the head of their household on a <a href="../../census1697.html#017">census document</a> taken just a month later. She re-married in 1699!</p>
