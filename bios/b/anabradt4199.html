<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony Bradt</b></a> was born in December 1692. He was the third of eight sons born to Albany mainstays <a href="anbbradt4197.html">Anthony Barentse</a> and <a href="../e/wiegb4544.html">Willempie Teunis</a> Bradt.</p>


<p>In July 1716, he married <a href="../vd/revdh5714.html">Rebecca Vanderheyden</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1737, eight of their children had been baptized in Albany where the parents were regular baptism sponsors. </p>

<p>These Bradts lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. Over a long career, Anthony A. was a successful carpenter and building contractor. During the 1740s, he built and repaired blockhouses and other parts of the city's fortifications. He served the community as a constable, contractor, and surveyor. He was elected assistant alderman several times beginning in 1735. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1742fl">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of qualified voters in the third ward. As late as <a href="../../census1756.html#70">1756</a>, he was identified on a census of Albany householders as a carpenter.</p>

<p>Anthony A. Bradt died in October 1760 - short of his sixty-eighth birthday. His widow lived for several years afterwards.</p>
