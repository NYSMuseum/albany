<strong>Henry J. Bleecker</strong></a> was born in February 1778. He was an older son in the large family of Albany mainliners <a href="jnbleecker204.html">Johannes N.</a> and <a href="../vd/mgtvdu5551.html">Margarita Van Deusen</a> Bleecker. His father was a prominent businessman and community leader whose <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home was an Albany landmark. His mother died in 1794 when Henry was just sixteen.  He mostly was referred to as "Henry J. Bleecker."  

<p>In November 1799, he married Mary <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~debyj/My%20Files/vw5b.html">Storm</a> of Hopewell Junction, Dutchess County. The marriage produced at least two children but they were not christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was assessed under the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household of his father. By <a href="../../census1800.html#188">1800</a>, however, he was identified as the head of his own household that was served by two slaves. In 1804, he was identified as the clerk of the New York State Senate and was a resident of Steuben Street. In 1802 he was a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia officer</a> but resigned the following April. 

<p>Henry J. Bleecker died in January 1808. His <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html">funeral</a> on January 30 was a community event and was attended by family and many notables. He was buried in the Dutch church plot on February 1. He had lived but thirty years. His widow re-married in 1809, left Albany, and lived until 1845.</p>
