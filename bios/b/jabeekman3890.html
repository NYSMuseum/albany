<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Beekman</b></a> was born in 1685. He was the second son of Albany blacksmith <a href="jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Martense</a> and his first wife, Machtel Schermerhorn Beekman - who died in 1689. He grew up as part of a large, combined family in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of an Albany mainstay. In 1728, he was among the twelve children named in the <a href="../../wills/willjombeekman3858.html">will</a> filed by his father.</p>


<p>Jacob married mayor's daughter <a href="../h/dehansen4947.html">Debora Hansen</a> in December 1714. By 1733, his six children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was an occasional baptism sponsor. In 1715, he was a trooper in an <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> company.</p>

<p>After a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3890">time</a> in the first ward, these Beekmans set up their home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> next to the house of Debora's father. Although he identified himself as a blacksmith, Jacob Beekman was a prominent businessman who was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> for the second ward in 1729. He owned lots on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> and had inherited a share of frontier land as well.</p>


<p>Jacob Beekman filed a <a href="../../wills/willjabeekman.html">will</a> in December 1738. He died in March 1739 and was buried from the Dutch church. He had lived fifty-three years. His will left a substantial estate to his widow and then five living children.</p>
