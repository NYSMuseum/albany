<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Bromley</strong></a> probably was born during the 1690s. By the 1720s if not earlier, he had settled in Albany. He probably was of <a href="../anglo.html">Anglo</a> origins. A muster roll for Captain <a href="../j/riingoldsby.html">Richard Ingoldsby</a>'s company of Grenadiers dated December 24, 1713 included the name of enlisted man "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=98k6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA451&lpg=PA451&dq=%22jno+brumby%22&source=bl&ots=Eg1UAcB_N0&sig=2VsYGTk_a4Jf1cNhojaywqpK8bM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjH7JfNt-3JAhXFsh4KHcqFDssQ6AEIKDAD#v=onepage&q=%22jno%20brumby%22&f=false">Jno Brumby</a>." He probably came to Albany as a member of the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a>.

<p>His wife was <a href="../../res/sp.html">called</a> "Sara" (perhaps <a href="../v/acviele6777.html">Viele</a>) 
        and their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> from 1722 to 1726. Others participating in Bromley baptisms 
        in Albany were of English background. 
      <p>In January 1723, he was appointed city <a href="../../corporation.html#retainers">bellman</a>. 
        In October 1725, he was paid thirteen pounds by the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a>. 
      <p>John Bromley was last heard from in Albany at the christening of his 
        daughter in June 1726. &nbsp; <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=lang_en&safe=off&rls=com.microsoft:en-US&q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+bromley+albany">However</a>, 
        his children and grandchildren raised families of their own in eighteenth 
        century Albany.</p>
