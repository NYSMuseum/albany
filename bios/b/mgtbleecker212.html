<a href="#sources">Margarita Bleecker</a> was born in October 1714. She was the daughter of  Albany leaders <a href="rjbleecker227.html">Rutger Janse</a> and older Widow <a href= "../s/caschuyler1241.html">Catalina Schuyler</a> Bleecker. She grew up in a large combined family in her mother's comfortable house on <a href"../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. </P>

          <p>She married <a href="../c/ecollins.html">Edward Collins</a> in the Albany 
            <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on December 9, 1733. Their marriage produced no children. 
            Instead, the couple served as godparents to a number of Albany children.</p>

<p>On the death of her husband in 1753, Margarita inherited his entire estate which included real and personal property and a number of "negroes and negro wenches." She also inherited a third of her father's personal property and received a settlement from her brothers a few years later. Still young, she did not remarry but was listed as the head of an Albany household on the city  census taken by the British army in 1756.</p>
 
<p>Margarita Bleecker Collins died at age 45 and was buried in the Dutch Church cemetery on May 1, 1760. Her <a href="../../wills/willmgtbleecker212.html">will</a>, filed on April 28, noted her "being sick" and listed as heirs her brothers, John R. and Jacobus Bleecker.</p>
