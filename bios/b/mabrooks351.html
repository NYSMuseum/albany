<p>Jacobus Van Zandt died in November 1795. In <a href="../../census1800.html#351">1800</a>, Widow Mary was listed on the census as the head of her first ward household. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, widow Mary Van Zandt was listed in the first city directory as head of the household at 10 Union Street.
