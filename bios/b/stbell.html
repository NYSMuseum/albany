<P><a href="#sources"><b>Stephen Bell</b></a> probably was born during the mid eighteenth century.</p>


<p>By 1775, he had married Albany native <a href="../k/elkid5982.html">Elizabeth Kidney</a>. Their sons were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1776 and 1781.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, he served as the jailer in Albany - tending to prisoners of war under orders from the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> and the <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies. From 1777 to the end of the war, his name frequently appeared in the records and accounts of both wartime organizations. Afterwards, he was accorded a land <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the first militia regiment.</p>  

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#950">1790</a>, his houseold included several children and was listed on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> portion of the first Federal census. In 1800, the Watervliet census configured his household with only a man and a woman each over forty-five years of age.</p>

 
<p>In 1801 and 1802, his <a href="../k/elkid5982.html">widow</a> was receiving <a href="../../poor.html">poor relief</a>. She died in 1828!</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Stephen Bell is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 950. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Perhaps he was the son of "public whipper" John Bell! We seek defining information on his origins.</p>
