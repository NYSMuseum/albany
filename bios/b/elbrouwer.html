<P>Perhaps future Albany resident <a href="#sources">
<strong>Elizabeth Brouwer</strong></a> was christened in March 1756. Tentatively then, she would have been the daughter of Dutchess County and Albany  residents <a href="nibrouwer.html">Nicholas</a> and, his <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~lottman/brouwer/nicholaes/adolph/nicholas/nnb1714.html">first</a> wife, <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~brouwergenealogydata/p107.htm#i20936">M</a>ary <a href="http://www.witsend.org/gen/dutcher/griffin.pdf"> D</a>utcher <a href="../../res/sp.html">Br</a>ouwer. 

<p>In 1777, she was named as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willnibrouwer.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>Elizabeth was the wife of <a href="../d/eldorr.html">Elisha Dorr</a>. Perhaps, they <a href="http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/gen/d0008/g0000052.htm#I06184">married</a> in September 1796. Her marriage has not been found among the records of Albany's existing <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Between 1797 and 1810, six children were christened in Albany. In 1804, she was listed among the members of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>. If the demographics given above are valid, her first child was born when she was thirty-one and the last when she was in her mid-forties.

<p>By 1793, the Connecticut-born Dorr had  become an Albany resident. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7877">1800</a>, their budding family was configured on the second ward census.

<p>These Dorrs were Albany mainstays at several locations for almost forty years. A number of their children became city residents.

<p>Elizabeth Brouwer Dorr died in September 1837. Her husband survived until 1843.</p>
