<strong>Peter Boyd</strong></a> was born during the 1770s. Community-based resources <a href="#obit">later</a> noted that his father had arrived from Scotland in 1774 and that ten Boyd sons had been born and educated in the city of Albany. Thus, he would have been the son of brewer and businessman <a href="jaboyd7389.html">James</a> and Margaret Mc Master Boyd.

<p>In May 1803, he married Margaret Mc Murry at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. The union of these Albany residents produced a number of children. They were members of the Presbyterian church where Peter was a trustee from 1813 until his death.


<p>These Boyds raised their family in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of Albany and lived nearby the businesses and home of his parents and siblings. Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, city censuses configured his fourth <a href="../../wards.html">ward</a> household. <a href="../../sources.html#ad">C</a>ity directories noted his home <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22boyd+peter%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22boyd%20peter%22&f=false">and</a> holdings on what became <a href="../../streets.html#court">South Market Street</a>.

<p>In 1806, he was appointed lieutenant of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">milita</a> regiment.

<p>Like several of his siblings, Peter Boyd was a merchant and civic leader. Beginning in 1801, he served Albany as a fireman, alderman, and supervisor. He was a bank officer and an officer in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245&lpg=PA245&dq=%22peter+boyd%22+albany&source=bl&ots=krygdO5JwS&sig=nLjlAlG4jhCW_xcvgnnAaoY0aA0&hl=en&ei=47ybS-mZKcP-8Aag6bH_DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20boyd%22%20albany&f=false">St. Andrews Society</a>.




<p>Peter Boyd died in July 1846. The newspaper <a href="#obit">obituary</a> said that since 1803 he had been an Albany merchant in the house of Peter & John I Boyd and that he was an active member of the First Presbyterian church. His <a href="#will">will</a> passed probate in August. His widow survived until <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/Deaths1860.htm">1860</a>.
