<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ASo0bJXoXbMC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false">ecclesastical resources</a>, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Andrew Bay</strong></a>  was born in <a href="../irish.html">Ireland</a> and is said to have been a weaver by trade. We seek more definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, formative years, and path to America. 

<p>He is said to have been ordained under the North Castle (Delaware) Presbytery in 1748. By that time, he already had settled at the <a href="http://www.lmcpc.org/history.htm">Lower Marsh Creek Church</a> in Pennsylvania where he remained until 1760.

<p>Perhaps Andrew Bay did not marry as no supporting records have been encountered.  

<p>From 1760 to 1768, Bay served in Churchville Maryland. During that time, he undertook missions to <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Albany</a> where he filled in for   Reverend <a href="../h/whanna8506.html">William Hanna</a> who had removed to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> to practice law and who later became an Anglican priest.

<p>While never officially installed in Albany, Bay served at the Albany meeting house intermittently from about 1760 to 1773. Another <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA768&lpg=PA768&dq=%22+1793+albany&source=bl&ots=m1bXSFgMpW&sig=ec-TWY69YVMCnJ8e-V_2YSsn30A&hl=en&ei=kb_TTvT2I6Pw0gGq5Nwk&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20bay%22%20albany&f=false">source</a> lists his tenure in Albany as from 1768 to 1773. He also provided missionary <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jHMrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA387&lpg=PA387&dq=%22andrew+bay%22+newtown&source=bl&ots=fNGQNog1dy&sig=qGEGJeMKxyBw3Qc7bgCAUSXcwyg&hl=en&ei=rgPVTsucHajz0gGuwpmiAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20bay%22%20newtown&f=false">services</a> to Scottish outliers to the west and north of Albany. While in Albany, he campaigned for funding to build a meeting house and attended regional Presbyterian conferences in the company of Albany's most <a href="../h/rhenry8425.html">prom</a>inent Presbyterians.

<p> After that, he then relocated to Newtown, Long Island where he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=I5Q-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA229&lpg=PA229&dq=%22andrew+bay%22+newtown&source=bl&ots=1FJyB9qq1f&sig=yNDVV6aZa2ofa_C10QU5syQhcmM&hl=en&ei=rgPVTsucHajz0gGuwpmiAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20bay%22%20newtown&f=false">characterized</a> as "a broad Scotsman" who was "duly installed [as] pastor" and known as "a highly talented and eloquent preacher."  However, by the end of May 1775, intemperate alcohol useage caused Bay to be dismissed (perhaps induced to resign) from his post at Newtown.  He is said to have died shortly thereafter. His family managed to stay at the parsonage until it was destroyed during the war. After that, Bay's name has not been found in available historical records.

<p>One-time Albany resident <a href="jobay.html">John Bay</a> is said to have been his nephew.</p>
