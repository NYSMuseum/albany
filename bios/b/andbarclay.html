          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Andrew Barclay</B></A> was born in Albany 
            in 1719. He was a younger son of <a href="tbarclay.html">Reverend 
            Thomas</a> and <a href="../d/andodrayer.html">Anna Dorothea Drayer</a> 
            Barclay. He grew up with two brothers 
            and Dutch-speaking mother in an Albany <a href="../../stpeters.html">Anglican 
            parsonage</a> where his father's mental health was on the decline. 
            Following the death of his father in 1726, this middle child was sent 
            downriver to learn business.</P>

<p>In 1737, eighteen-year-old Andrew Barclay married Helena Roosevelt of New York City. The marital connection helped him become a Wall Street merchant and the father of five sons and six daughters who married into the upper levels of Anglo-New York society.</p>

          <p>Son and brother of Anglican clerics, this Manhattan-based merchant was a known 
            royalist whose involvement in the struggle for American liberties 
            was curtailed by an early <a href="#death">death</a> in June 1775. 
            His epitaph read "On Monday last, died Mr. Andrew Barclay, an eminent 
            merchant and brother of the <a href="hebarclay.html">Rev. Dr. Barclay</a>."</P>
