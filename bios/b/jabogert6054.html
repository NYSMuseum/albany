<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob J. Bogert</strong></a> was born in September 1687. He was the son of <a href="jacbogert6052.html">Jacob C</a> and <a href="../q/janq2136.html">Jannetje Quackenbush</a> Bogert. To mitigate confusion with his father and younger, same-named family members, we need to refer to this Albany resident as "Jacob J. Bogert the elder."

<p>In November 1709, he was commissioned to "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198&lpg=PA198&dq=bogard&source=bl&ots=2hQsH0Wu8v&sig=4lD0C0XQmnOdYuxMcStv5XnGIGE&hl=en&ei=FJgDTZmEBoL_8Abz5YjnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=bogard&f=false">repaer</a>" the city gates. 

<p>By 1711, he had married trader's daughter <a href="../s/caschuyler1242.html">Catharina Schuyler</a>. Between 1711 and 1721, a son and five daughters were christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715jmc.html#6054">1715</a>, he was a member of Captain Johannes Mingael's militia company for the city of Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1716">1716</a>, "Jacob Bogaert Junr." was named firemaster for the second ward. We believe this individual was appointed rather than his aged father.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6054">1720</a>, he was included among the freeholders of the city's third ward. At that time, he was called "Jacob Borghaert Jr." as his father lived nearby.
<p>This Jacob lost his same-named father in 1725.

<p>In December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22jacob+boghaert%22+volume+9&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q&f=false">1738</a>, a "Jacob Boghaert" petitioned the city council to buy a piece of unimproved land along the north side of Foxes Creek. (By that time and thereafter, a younger, city-based <a href="jabogert6108.html">Jacob Bogert</a> is at risk and dictates caution in the assignment of community-based information.

<p>Pending confirmation of Jacob J. Bogert's <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
