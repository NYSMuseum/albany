<P>In 1660, <a href="#sources"><b>Jan Jurrianse Becker</b></a> was licensed to keep a school in New Amsterdam. Shortly thereafter, he made his way to 
<a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he sought to do the same. In 1670, he was licensed by the governor "for ye teaching of youth to read & to wryte" in Albany. As late as 1676, he still held a schoolteacher's license.</p>

<p>Jan Jurrianse's career in America had a number of facets. During the 1650s, he was identified as a clerk at Ft. Casimir on the Delaware. In 1669, he was appointed a notary in Albany - apparently holding that position for many years! In 1689, he was named <a href="../../corporation.html#treas">treasurer</a> of the city and county of Albany and held that position until 1693.</p>

<p>By 1660, he had married Maria Adriens. The marriage produced two surviving children including their daughter <a href="marbecker6044.html">Martina</a> who married soldier-turned-innkeeper <a href="../h/wmhogan4396.html">William Hogan</a>. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>He was an Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#6030">householder</a> and also may have held property in Greenbush. His first ward home was an Albany landmark. 

<p>Jan Jurrianse Becker filed a <a href="../../wills/willjjbecker.html">will</a> in October 1694. He was dead by October 1697 when it passed probate. By that time, his <a href="../../census1697.html#023">son</a> and daugther were living in his Albany houses.</p>
