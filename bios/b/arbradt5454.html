<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ariaantie Bradt</b></a> was born about 1651. She was the daughter of New Netherland poineers <a href="aranbradt4181.html">Arent Andriesse</a> and <a href="../d/cadvos7854.html">Cathalina De Vos</a> Bradt. She grew up in the vicinity of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and in Schenectady where her father was among the original patentees. Arent Andriesse died about 1663 and her mother re-married before Ariaantie was sixteen.</p>


<p>Her first husband was <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> resident Helmer Otten - who fathered at least one of her children before his early death. By 1676, she had married <a href="../s/rjscher5490.html">Ryer Schermerhorn</a> - an emerging leader in the Schenectady community. In 1690, these Schermerhorns became refugees in Albany. In <a href="../../census1697.html#105">1697</a>, they had four children living in their Albany house. In 1699, she was named to share in the <a href="../../wills/willcjvbock.html">estate</a> of her step father. 

<p>After 1700, Ariaantie Bradt Otten Schermerhorn returned with her husband to Schenectady  live out the remainder of their lives. In 1717, she was named as Schermerhorn's prime beneficiary.</p>
