          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Anna/Hannah Beasley</B></A> was born in Albany in 
            1726, the daughter of schoolteacher <a href="jobeasley7287.html">John 
            Beasley</a> and widow <a href="../d/lydealy5402.html">Lydia Dealy</a> Van Benthuysen. With her brother, 
            <a href="hebeasley7286.html">Henry</a>, she grew up in an Albany home that included five siblings from 
            her mother's previous marriage.</P>

          <P>By the mid-1740s, she had married <a href="../c/ricartwright6508.html">Richard 
            Cartwright</a> - an English-born opportunist who would become early 
            Albany's most prominent innkeeper. Their large family of at least 
            eight children born between 1747 and 1759 would grow up on the <a href="#southside">Southside</a> 
            - the heart of one of Albany's first neighborhoods.</P>

<p>by the 1760s, Cartwright's "Kings Arms" tavern was a center of English-speaking life in a bustling community that was undergoing fundamental changes with the influx of new people. Hannah Cartwright played the innkeeper's wife - as their holdings expanded to accommodate the newcomers who lived with them as boarders. Daughter of the English schoolmaster, like her husband she was a communicant of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> Anglican church.</p>


<p>In August 1778, Hannah left her home and went with her husband and other family members to join the British in Canada.</p>
 

<p>Hanna Cartwright died in September 1795 and was buried in St. Paul's churchyard in Kensington, Ontario.</p>

</FONT><P><FONT size=-1><A name=southside><b>"Southside"</b></a> is a term used to describe that part of the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> behind State and Court Streets. This area was first settled by former garrison soldiers during the early 1700s.
