<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Kn</a>own as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Marte Beekman, Jr. </strong></a>, this individual was an adult in Albany at least during the late 1760s and early 70s. At this point, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">th</a>ink that he was born early in 1746 (christened January 10) and thus would have been the son (4th of 6 <a href="http://njgsbc.org/files/BCFamilies/BCFam-Beekman.pdf">children</a>) of  Albany residents <a href="hebeekman3889.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../s/answitts5649.html">Anna Swits</a> Beekman. Despite less than definitive <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, this sketch focuses on Albany resident "Marte Beekman, Jr." At least one other same-named contemporary who like others in each generation, was <a href="beekman.html">named</a> for the family patriarch), and  is at-risk at this time. 

<p>In 1766 and 1767, the name "Marte Beekman" appeared on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> in five different places at different times. All listings appear to have been in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. However, only one of them was identified as "Marte Beekman Junn" and he was listed next to (<a href="../../res/guess.html">prob</a>ably his uncle) blacksmith and businessman "<a href="mabeekman3877.html">Marte Beekman</a>" whose assessment (&pound;35) ranked him among the highest in the city. Marte Jr.'s property, also in the third ward, was valued at &pound;2. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Per</a>haps this younger son was named for his affluent uncle. 

<p>In May 1768, <a href="../qqqq.html#one">a</a> "Martin H. Beekman" was <a  href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ROk5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA890&lpg=PA890&dq=marte+beekman+jun&source=bl&ots=PtQhH7j6H-&sig=j_fJ8C4D-6iPlV6hcivfm2vlbI4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjSx7-Ej83LAhUEeT4KHcF1BawQ6AEIQzAJ#v=onepage&q=marte%20beekman%20jun&f=false">identified</a> as an ensign in a newly formed regiment of foot (infantry) drawn from the western part of Albany County. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Per</a>haps he was this Marte Jr. - the son of Hendrick Beekman and kin to a number of older officers named for the regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, "Marte Jur." was appointed a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fire</a>master for the third ward.

<p>At this point, we have not been able to connect this subject to a <a href="../../marriages.html">marriage</a> or to subsequent offspring.

<p>Thru the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary era, a variety of qualitative materials for Albany resident "Marte Beekman" gives us pause pending more <a href="../../cbr.html">definitive</a> demographic information on him and his immediate family. However, by <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, no <a href="../../res/sp.html">Martes</a> were identified as heads of households in New York State.

<p>Perhaps the "house of Martin Beekman" identified on a Market Street <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#first">streetscape</a> visualizing the early 1800s locates his residence.

<p>With outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> and unable to set this subject on the community landscape, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany resident Marte Beekman Jr.
