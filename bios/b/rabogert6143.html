<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rachel Bogert</strong></a> was born in March 1715. She was the daughter of <a href="cobogert6063.html">Cornelis</a> and his second wife, <a href="../o/dooo419.html">Dorothy Oothout</a> Bogert. She grew up in a small, blended family in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of a prominent Albany woodworker.

<p>In April 1752, Rachel would have been thirty-seven when she married the slightly older <a href="../d/vodouw2233.html">Volkert A. Douw</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced two surviving children. Her <a href="../d/anddouw2058.html">son</a> may have been born years before the wedding when the mother would have been thirty. In 1759, Rachel Douw was counted among the church pewholders.

<p>In 1755, she was left a financial bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willcobogert6063.html">will</a> filed by her father who died a few months later. 

<p>Her husband was a merchant of some repute but survived only until 1768 when he filed a <a href="../../wills/willvodouw2233.html">will</a>. She was made executor and left half of his substantial estate. Volkert A. Douw, died two months later.

<p>In March 1779, her third ward property was <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6143">valued</a> on the assessment roll. Living in her house was her son <a href="../d/anddouw2058.html">Andreas</a>.
 
<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, Rachel Bogert Douw died in September 1780.</p>
