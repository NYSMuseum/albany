<strong>Dorothea Bogert</strong></a> probably was born in 1752. <a href="http://www.gremmert.com/getperson.php?personID=I67012&tree=ardeneva">Perhaps</a> she <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3gRhAAAAMAAJ&dq=zabriskie+albany&q=105+albany">was</a> the daughter of Albany carpenter <a href="hebogert6096.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vs/envschaick4026.html">Engeltie Van Schaick</a> Bogert who was christened in Albany on May 3. If so, her <a href="../vs/envschaick4026.html">mother</a> died in 1764 and her father in 1788. However, she was not named in the <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html">inventory</a> taken of her father's estate.

<p>In May 1778, Dorothy married "John Sabrisky" (<a href="../z/jozab6986.html">John Zabriskie, Jr.</a>) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. No children were christened at the church. However, during the 1790s, she was a pewholder there. Earlier, she had been a baptism sponsor.

<p>We seek information on the lives of the Zabriskies during the 1780s and 90s. At this point, they are missing from the Albany-based <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a> for those years.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#6986">1800</a>, these Zabriskies (a couple over 45 years old) were listed on the census for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> of Albany. However, Dorothea's husband died in 1805 and his will was recorded in 1808 .

<p>Dorothea Bogert Zabriskie was dead by May 11, 1811 when her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate.
