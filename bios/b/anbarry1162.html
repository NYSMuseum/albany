<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ann Barry</b></a> was the wife of Albany businessman <a href="thbarry1821.html">Thomas Barry</a>.</p>


<p>It appears that she was born about 1738. She probably married Barry about 1763 and gave birth to at least ten children. Her <a href="#obit">obituary</a> stated that she lived in Albany for more than sixty years and had come to America with her husband. However, she may have been Barry's second wife.</p>

<p>Barry was in Albany during the 1750s. By the late 1760s, these Barrys were prominent members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. They lived on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> near the old Dutch church.</p>

<p>Barry was a successful merchant, manufacturer, and one of the founders of the Albany Catholic Church. During the Revolution, he is <a href="#obit">said</a> to have taken his family to Philadelphia for a few years. Anna, the infant daughter of Ann and Thomas Barry, was baptized in the Philadelphia Catholic church in February 1779.</p>

<p>The Barrys were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#1821">mainstays</a> for several decades. Ann Barry's beauty and charm were <a href="#obit">remembered</a> for many years!</p>   

<p>Ann Barry lost her husband in 1813. She then sold off some of her husband's real estate. She was not listed in Albany city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a>. Following a confining illness, Ann Barry died in July 1831 at the age of ninety-three. An <a href="#obit">obituary</a> in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> paid tribute to her long life. Her will passed probate in December.</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Ann Barry is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1162. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We can guess that she was from Ireland and later belonged to St. Mary's Catholic church.</p>

<p><a name=obit><b>Obituary:</b> "July 2, 1831 - widow of Thomas, died age 93 - arrived in America with her husband more than 60 years prior to her death. Her husband was a merchant who resided in Albany until his death - but during Revolutionary War he moved family to Philadelphia for a few years. She is represented to have been "fair and beautiful beyond the usual years of a woman's personal charms and extremely interesting and pleasing in conversations and manners until disease confined her to a sick bed."
