<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelis Bogert</b></a> was born in September 1683. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jacbogert6052.html">Jacob C.</a> and <a href="../q/janq2136.html">Jannetje Quackenbush</a> Bogert.</p>


<p>His first wife was Cornelia La Maitre who died after giving birth to their only child. In October 1707, he married <a href="../o/dooo419.html">Dorothea Oothout</a> at her father's Albany house. By 1724, six more of his children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>These Bogerts lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where he owned moderate property next to the house and lot of his father. He served as a firemaster in 1731, belonged to a city company of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> in 1715, and was identified as a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6063">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6063">1742</a>.</p>

<p>He was a carpenter who specialized in building watercraft. He was paid by the Albany government on a number of occasions for repairing the "city walls" and by the province of New York for carpentry work and for supplying wood for boat building at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>.</p> 


<p>Cornelis Bogert filed a <a href="../../wills/willcobogert6063.html">will</a> in May 1755. Calling himself an Albany shipwright, the will stated that he was "sick" and named Dorothea as his chief beneficiary during her widowhood. He died in July 1755 - a few months shy of his seventy-second birthday.</p>
