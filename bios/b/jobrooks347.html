      <P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jonathan Brooks</strong></a> probably 
        was born in 1738. He may have been the son of Joshua (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Jo</a>sua) 
        and Ge___ Bonds Brooks who was <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part3.html">ch</a>ristened 
        "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LNlSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22Jan,+of+Josua+and+Geesje+Broeks%22&source=bl&ots=pG0P7pk_v9&sig=6WcfmEcGH01NS2ClGRILgKaqlxI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi09ov73ZfKAhXGFj4KHTKjBbwQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=%22Jan%2C%20of%20Josua%20and%20Geesje%20Broeks%22&f=false">Jan</a>" 
        at the Albany Dutch church on December 24 of that year. This individual 
        was an Albany resident who would have come of age during the 1760s. Care 
        must be taken to not confuse him with the family <a href="jobrooks346.html">patriarch</a> 
        or with younger, same-named kinsman who also <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22jonathan+brooks%22+albany">lived</a> 
        during the course of this individual's long life. 
      <p>In January 1767, he married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck 
        native <a href="elbradt2445.html">Elizabeth Bradt</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Anglican church. A daughter and son were christened in the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1774 and 1779. However, 
        he was a <a href="../../coerec1771.html#347">member</a> at St. Peter's. 
      <p>This Brooks family were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#347">mainstays</a> 
        for more than sixty years. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, 
        his lot on the <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">hill</a> was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=%22jonathan+brooks%22+albany&source=bl&ots=wyiE8Xtcgs&sig=7fPecPYU_NULA0xLfgpm1XqZc6w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiKzdWN4JfKAhUFOz4KHRMbCrk4ChDoAQgjMAI#v=onepage&q=%22jonathan%20brooks%22%20albany&f=false">referenced</a> 
        in the city council minutes. Jonathan was a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a> 
        who lived above South Pearl Street in a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#347">home</a> 
        that later was referenced as 13 and/or 15 Plain Street. As late as <a href="../../census1800.html#347">1800</a>, 
        his household of five members was served by three slaves. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, 
        a "Jonathan Brooks, Jr." was listed on the census of heads of households. 
        Beginning with the first edition in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=%22+%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=brooks,&f=false">1813</a>, 
        two Jonathans were listed in city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> 
        as carpenters at 13 and 15 Plain Street. 
      <p>During the 1780s, he served as fireman and watchman and was paid from 
        the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> treasury. He seems to have 
        served as a building inspector as well. 
      <p>Jonathan Brooks died in 1829. His <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> 
        obituary <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=%22jonathan+Brooks+died%22&source=bl&ots=GvM8WrXDJH&sig=3t4pN6n1IxngQDnzCJF1Nx67vFQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwir_JSk25fKAhXEXD4KHeLhC7s4ChDoAQgfMAI#v=onepage&q=%22jonathan%20Brooks%20died%22&f=false">read</a>:" 
        April 3. Jonathan Brooks died, aged 91. He was born on the 13th May, 1738, 
        in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>, where he lived during 
        his whole life; was remarkable for honesty and industry, and preserved 
        the simplicity of ancient times." His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> 
        passed probate later in the month. His widow lived until 1832 - also reaching 
        the age of ninety-two.</p>
