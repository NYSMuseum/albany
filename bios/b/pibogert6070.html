      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Bogert</strong></a> was born in September 
        1689. He was the son of <a href="jacbogert6052.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../q/janq2136.html">Jannetje 
        Quackenbush</a> Bogert. This middle child grew up in a large family in his father's third 
        ward home. 
      <p>About 1710, he married Albany native <a href="../f/refonda3770.html">Rebecca 
        Fonda</a>. By 1726, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> although their marriage was not entered in the church records. 
        Over several decades, he was a frequent baptism sponsor. 
      <p>These Bogerts raised their family in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. He was a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> and 
        Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#67">mainstay</a> for more than fifty 
        years. In <a href="../../lists/list1715jmc.html#6070">1715</a>, his name 
        was included on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1719">1719</a>, he was appointed 
        firemaster.
		 
<p>Over the next decades, his land near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a> was referenced in the city records. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6070">1742</a> 
        and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6070">1763</a>, his name was 
        found on lists of Albany freeholders. 
      <p>Pieter Bogert buried his wife in February 1754. More than a decade later, 
        his name and modest holdings still appeared on third ward <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. He probably died before the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>.</p>
