<P><A href="#sources"><B>Barent Albertse Bradt</B></A> was born in Amsterdam, Holland and baptized in the Lutheran church there in October 1634. He was the first son born to <a href="albanbradt4180.html">Albert Andriesse</a> and <a href="../../bios/b/anbarents.html">Anna Barents</a>. He came to America with his parents in 1637.</P>

      <P>Growing up on his father's <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        farm, he learned the mechanics of farming, milling, and trading. Those 
        skills enabled him to represent his father and then establish himself 
        in the new village of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. About 
        that time, he married <a href="../d/susdircks4368.html">Susanna Dircks</a> - the mother of his eight children. 
        The marriage suffered from Barent's intemperate behavior which led to 
        several court appearances on battery and assault charges!</p>

<p>Barent derived his income from sawing - probably at his father's Normanskill mill. At the same time, he sought to take part in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. He sought acceptance in now Albany by joining the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, he found trading difficult as his family was fined several times for illegal trading.</p>

<p>Instead, Barent Albertse found success in real estate - acquiring several parcels and using  boards cut at the Bradt mill to build houses in Albany and outside the stockade. By 1682, he was living outside the north gate. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#4182">1684</a>, his Albany taxes were in arrears. Fives years <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">later</a>, he was listed among the farmers employed by Marte Gerritse but was assessed no money for defense.  Raising a large family, he also was the guardian of a number of related children and a frequent baptism sponsor for family members and neighbors.</p>

<p>By the 1690s, he had become an Albany mainstay. He served on juries and as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and roadmaster. In <a href="../../census1697.html#078">1697</a>, Barent, Susanna, and one child were living in his <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> house just outside the north gate. Assessment rolls for ensuing <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4182">years</a> place him among the moderately wealthy Albany householders.</p> 


      <p>He also acquired lots at Halfmoon and <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 
        Barent Albertse Bradt disappeared from Albany rolls after 1712. His <a href="bradt.html#bbs">four sons</a> further established the Bradt name in Albany and its hinterland.</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Barent Albertse Bradt is CAP biography 4182. 
        This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../bios/b/bradt.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Because his 
        adult life was almost entirely within the Albany context, our research 
        has generated substantial material. Nevertheless, we acknowledge with 
        gratitude the <a href="bradt.html#sources">substantial work</a> of Peter 
        R. Christoph.</p>
