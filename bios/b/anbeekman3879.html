<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Beekman</b></a> was born in November 1698. She was the daughter of Albany blacksmith Johannes Martense and his second wife, Eva Vinhagen Beekman.</p>


<p>She married Albany businessman <a href="../m/jomarselis733.html">Johannes Marselis</a> in July 1723. By 1742, their eight children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>These Marselises set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Johannes served as an alderman from 1740 until his untimely death in January 1746. Forty-eight-years-old at that time, Anna Marselis did not re-marry!</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#238">1756</a>, the "Widow Marselis" was identified as the head of an Albany household. Her name and property in the first ward appeared on city assessment rolls during the 1760s. In 1779, the head of the household was her son, <a href="../m/gymarselis718.html">Gysbert Marselis</a>.</p> 

<p>Anna Beekman Marselis filed a <a href="../../wills/willanbeekman3879.html">will</a> in August 1769 naming her five living children. It passed probate in January 1785.</p>
