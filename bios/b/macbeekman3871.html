<strong>Machtel Beekman</strong></a> was born in October 1715. She was the first daughter born to the marriage of <a href="jabeekman3890.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../h/dehansen4947.html">Deborah Hansen</a> Beekman. She grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of an Albany mainstay.

<p>In December 1738, she was left a bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willjabeekman.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>In January 1739, she married the somewhat older Albany native <a href="../l/gelansing3702.html">Gerrit A. Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Unfortunately the marriage would be of brief duration as well as childless as Machtel Beekman Lansing died later that year. She had lived less than twenty-five years. Thirty years later, her husband married again and lived until 1789.</p>
