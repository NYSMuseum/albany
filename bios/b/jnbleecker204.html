<strong>John N. Bleecker</strong></a> was born in August 1739. He was the son of Albany businessman <a href="nibleecker220.html">Nicholas</a> Bleecker, Jr. and his wife, <a href="../r/mgtroseboom1941.html">Margarita Roseboom</a> Bleecker. John N. lost his father in 1751 but his mother survived for more than forty years afterwards.


<p>His wife was <a href="../vd/mgtvdu5551.html">Margarita Van Deusen</a>. Between 1776 and 1789, eight children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and later a member of the Consistory.

<p>John N. Bleecker set up his home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> next to the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1941">house</a> of his mother. Besides his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#204">residence</a>, Bleecker owned many other properties in Albany including lots and storehouses and additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">acreage</a> beyond the city limits as well.

<p>His long-term association with the Albany corporation began as a contractor during the 1760s. He was elected assistant alderman first in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1767">1767</a> and served for several years. After the War for Independence, he served as <a href="../../org/cc.html#1778">alderman</a> in the second ward for a number of years. 

<p>These Bleeckers were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#204">mainstays</a> for several decades. John N. Bleecker held leadership positions in many community <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">organizations</a> and was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company as well.

<p>At the onset of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, he was elected to represent the second ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> . He served for the life of that organization. He also held a commission in a militia company. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#204">land bounty right</a>.

<p>John N. Bleecker had lost his wife in 1794. But aided by slaves and family members, he  continued to <a href="../../census1800.html#204">maintain</a> his Pearl Street home. He died in October 1825. His will passed probate on October 28. He had lived eight-seven years.</p>
