<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Mary Barret</strong></a> was born in September 1738. She was the daughter of <a href="robarret7233.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../m/mamartin.html">Mary Martin</a> Barret. She grew up  as the eldest child in a moderate-sized Albany household but lost her mother in 1754 and her father two years later when she was just eighteen. 

<p>In June 1760, Mary was identified as a "spinster" when she married <a href="../h/dahewson8623.html">Daniel Hewson</a>, Jr. at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. Several children were christened there as both parents were members.

<p>These Hewsons probably lived with or near family members on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany.

<p>In 1788, she was named in the <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> of her childless <a href="thbarret7235.html">brother</a> and her five living children were identified a number of years later when Thomas Barret's will was presented for probate.

 <P>Perhaps she was the "Widow Mary Hewson" listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> for 1813 and into the 1820s at 42 and 43 Liberty Street. We seek information the later life and passing of Mary Barret Hewson.</p>
