      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob/James Bleecker, Jr.</strong></a> was 
        born in October 1755. He was the son of <a href="jorbleecker201.html">John 
        R.</a> and <a href="../s/elstaats4566.html">Elizabeth Staats</a> Bleecker. 
        He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a> home of an Albany mainstay. His godfather, an older "Jacob 
        Bleecker, Jr.", perhaps lived in close proximity to this individual. 
      <p>Coming of age during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> years, 
        we expect to be able to further document his service activities. From 
        November 1775 and into 1778, he was elected to represent the second ward 
        on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. 
        In Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#194">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>Beginning in 1770, his accounts were paid from the <a hhref="../../corporation.html">city</a> 
        treasury. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1778">1778</a>, he was appointed 
        firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#194">1779</a>, his house and 
        property were first valued on city assessment rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#194">1788</a>, 
        his second ward home and property were valued substantially. He owned 
        a number of lots in the second ward as well. 
      <p>In November 1782, he married Albany native <a href="../vz/ravzandt315.html">Rachel 
        Van Zandt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1790, four children had been christened in Albany. 
<p>Census returns for <a href="../../census1790.html#194">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html#194">1800</a> configured his Pearl Street household nearby other Bleecker kin. His household included four slaves whom he <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#1810">freed</a> after 1800 as in 1810, four free persons of color were living in his widow's household. 
      <p>In March 1792, this now middle-aged Albany merchant and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">gentleman</a> 
        was provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willjorbleecker201.html">will</a> 
        filed by his affluent father. 
      <p>In January 1808, his name and those of his sons was on a <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#194">list</a> 
        of those invited to a family funeral.

<p>Jacob Bleecker, Jr. died in December 1808 and was buried from his church. His widow survived for three more decades - after living in their home at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22bleecker+widow ann%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22bleecker%20widow%22&f=false">49 Pearl Street</a> for several years. </p>
