<strong>Henry Bostwick</strong></a> probably was born about 1735. According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, he was the son of David and Sarah Nichols Bostwick of Stratford, Connecticut. Perhaps he was the brother or otherwise related to Albany resident <a href="aubostwick7380.html">Augustus Bostwick</a>.


<p>Henry was a frontier trader who was living in Albany in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1757">1757</a> when he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. About that time, he was witnessing baptisms at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. In 1759, he was among the founding members of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>

<p>In 1761, he was granted the right to trade in the Great Lakes region by General Thomas Gage. In 1763, he was called an "English trader" and was <a href="http://www.gbl.indiana.edu/archives/miamis14/M63_13d.html">captured</a> by the Ottawas. He was taken by them to Quebec where he was ransomed. In 1768, he was in London, then Montreal, and on his way to <a href="http://www.mackinacparks.com/parks/a-brief-history-of-michilimackinac_580/">Michilimakinac</a> where he kept a trading house .

<p>In 1770, he formed a company with <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> and others to mine copper in the Lake Superior region. That venture failed in 1774.

<p>From the 1750s into the 1770s, Henry Bostwick's name appeared in business correspondence in New York and beyond. We seek defining information on his later life, passing, and marital situation.</p>
