<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously (chiefly Bromley and Brumley), this page organizes information on the <a href="#sources"> <strong>Bromley</strong></a> family of early Albany. These Albany mainstays probably found their roots in the greater <a href="../anglo.html">British</a> Isles and then migrated to <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a>.

<p>Born prior to 1700, by the 1720s, one-time soldier <a href="jobromley5957.html">John Bromley</a> and his American-born wife had settled in Albany and were raising a family. His son and grandsons maintained a firm but finite presence in the city throughout the eighteenth century.

<p><a href="wmbromley5965.html">William</a> (Billy) Bromley, was the principal family stakeholder over the middle half of the century.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5963">1779</a>, two parcels for <a href="sabromley5963.html">Samuel Bromley</a> were listed on the second ward assessment.

<p>For the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a>, the names of <a href="#men">five men</a> spelled "Brumbley" or "Brumley" appeared on what appears to be a <a href="https://dmna.ny.gov/historic/reghist/rev/New_York_In_The_Revolution_2nd_ed_1898.pdf">composite roster</a> for the First Regiment of the New York Line.

<p>Following the end of the war, Samuel Bromley's inn and holdings were prominent <a href="../../\im\im1794.html">landmarks</a> along upper Lion Street at the eastern end of the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a> to Schenectady.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5963">1790</a>, the household of <a href="sabromley5963.html">Samuel Bromley</a> was configured on the census. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo2">later</a>, David Bromley joined Samuel as second ward Albany householders.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22Bromley%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=bromley&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory noted two Bromley-named addresses including grocer <a href="dabromley5956.html">David Bromley</a> who does not appear to be connected to the first Albany Bromley. </p>

I., and Stonington, Conn.</i></a> by Viola Anette (Derby) Bromley (New York, 1911). This compendious work of more than 400 pages included much of the traditional information on the Albany Bromleys beginning with <a href="jobromley5957.html">John</a> the Albany patriarch. However, it does not appear to make a solid connection to the New England family that is its main subject. But, see <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5G4tAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=brumley+albany+ny&source=bl&ots=U71IyeKgds&sig=edW-LWnBkh07yzPONWWt-pjs_uQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfjo-x3qnKAhXEMj4KHd6dD604ChDoAQhCMAc#v=onepage&q=david%20bromley&f=false">references</a> to the Albany Brumleys in that work.
