<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Robert Barret</strong></a> (also Robert <a href="../../res/sp.html">Barrett</a>) was born after 1650. He probably came to New York and then Albany as a soldier. In <a href="../../lists/list1698ric.html#7221">1698</a>, his name appeared on the roster of a company of Grenadiers stationed at Albany.
 
<p>Probably during the late 1680s, he married Wyntie Jans of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. At this point, we have no source for their marriage date. Between 1689 and 1701,   six children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, neither parent seems to have served as baptism sponsor during those years. Their offspring established the Barret family in Albany and its hinterland.

<p>Robert Barret was settled in Albany by the late 1690s. In November 1699, he was appointed night watchman and was "<a href="#paid">well-paid</a>" for that service. Shortly thereafter, he <a href="#lease">leased</a> the western part of the alms house and its adjoining farm from the deacons of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
		
<p>Over the next two decades, he served as one of the watchmen and the bellmen for the city of Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7221">1709</a>, his property in the first ward was hardly taxed At that time, he was living in the midst of a soldier <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#ss">enclave</a> that later would be known as "<a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>".


<p>Robert Barret was last heard from in October 1713 when he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA289&lpg=PA289&dq=%22robert+barret%22+albany&source=bl&ots=Sr5oRNyqvn&sig=Em71FHa1FeMIJpAynRVBBXdX5tY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=j492U-GbLIrsoATRr4DQBw&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20barret%22%20albany&f=false">engaged again</a> to serve as the city bellman. He was to receive &pound;21 plus other benefits. <a href="../../res/ts.html">P</a>erhaps his widow survived until 1746.</p>
