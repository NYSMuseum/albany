<strong>Henry B. Bradt</strong></a> was born in November 1750. He was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="bebradt4335.html">Bernardus</a> and <a href="../vv/cavvechten2397.html">Catharina Van Vechten</a> Bradt. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a transporter and landholder who at one time shared the contract to operate the cross river <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>. 

<p>By January 1772 but <a href="#sources">perhaps</a> not officially until more than a year later, he had married an Anna/Hannah David. By 1790, the marriage had produced nine children - some of whom were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>Although we have yet to connect him to specific wartime activities, afterwards, a "Henry Bradt" was granted <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a>  under the Albany militia regiment.  

<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4240">1788</a>, the first ward house of Henry B. Bradt was valued on the city assessment roll. Two years later in <a href="../../census1790.html#4240">1790</a>, his household included six boys under sixteen. In <a href="../../census1800.html#4240">1800</a>, Henry and an older woman (perhaps he had re-married) still had three adolescent boys in their home.  Anna probably was dead by that time as a receipt to Henry B. Bradt for funeral expenses for his wife from July 1794 is included in the <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc17396.htm">Bradt family papers</a> collection in the New York State Library.

<p>In 1797, a list of freeholders for the first ward identified him as a "yeoman." Just after1800, his name no longer appeared on <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based documents</a>.

<p>By the time of publication of the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in 1813, he seems to have left 
Albany. He <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc17396.htm">seems</a> to have held substantial land across the river in Greenbush. A "Henry B. Bradt" died in May 1823 and was buried in Hoosic. His estate took some time to be settled.</p>

The life of Henry B. <a href="bradt.html">Bradt</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 4240. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. A "record" the offspring of Henry and Hanah Bratt (married December 15, 1773?) with information on the births of nine children is in the <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc17396.htm">Bradt family papers</a> collection at the New York State Library (Box 1, folder 22). The collection also includes a number of later real estate papers involving the holdings of Henry Bradt.</p>
