<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelia Bogardus</strong></a> was christened on July 1, 1722. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="shbogardus6387.html">Shibboleth</a> and <a href="../d/andgarmo783.html">Anna De Garmo</a> Bogardus. She grew up as the youngest daughter in a large family in her father's landmark <a href="../../wards.html">second ward</a> home. Both parents died in 1747.

<p>This Cornelia Bogardus does not appear to have married but was named along with her four living siblings in the <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus.html">will</a> filed by her brother <a href="pibogardus.html">Pieter</a> in 1756. Perhaps she was living with one of them.

<p>In 1762, her sister Catharina transferred a pew to her in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
 
<p>Perhaps she was the Cornelia Bogardus who was the householder of record on city assessment rolls in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and '67. Her "sister" was also identified on the second ward lists.</p>

<p>After that, her name dropped from Albany rolls leaving us with only <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding her later life and passing.</p>
