<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Jannetje Beekman</strong></a> was born about 1682. She was the eldest daughter of Albany mainstay <a href="jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Martense</a> and his first wife, <a href="../s/macscher5483.html">Machtel Schermerhorn</a> Beekman. By 1692, her mother had died and her father re-married. Beekman's second marrige produced at least nine more children and Jannetje would have been expected to help raise them in their <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home.
  
<p>In June 1703, she married <a href="../l/islansing3468.html">Isaac Lansing</a> in a ceremony  held at her father's house. Six months later, the first of their six children was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Isaac Lansing was a shoemaker and businessman who was involved in a number of community activities. His <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was an Albany landmark for more than sixty years.

<p>Jannetje Beekman Lansing died in February 1770. She had lived almost eight-eight years. Her husband died in January 1772!
