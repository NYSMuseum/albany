<strong>Willempie Bradt</strong></a> was born in December 1715. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="barbradt4212.html">Barent Bradt</a> and his first wife, <a href="../r/maryckman1980.html">Maria Ryckman</a> Bradt. She grew up in a small family in her long-lived and prominent father's landmark <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home. However, he mother died pre-maturely and Barent Bradt re-married in 1730.

<p>In December 1739, Willempie married Albany native <a href="dobogert6089.html">Douwe Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. by 1757, six children had been christened at the church where she was a pewholder.

<p>This Bogert family <a href="../../census1756.html#43">lived</a> in the second ward where Douwe practiced the shoemaker's trade. His name appeared on Albany rolls during the 1760s but not afterward. Widow Willempie lived somewhat longer. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, she was the "Widow Bogert" whose second ward house and lot were valued on city assessment rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4283">1788</a>, she still was the owner of record.  Perhaps her <a href="../b/babogert6081.html">son</a> and married <a href="wibogert6152.html">daughter</a> also  lived in her building. 

<p>Willempie Bradt Bogert probably yielded to her son in <a href="../../census1790.html#6081">1790</a> as she appears to be accounted for under Barent's household on the census. Perhaps she was the "Mrs. Bogert" buried by her son in April 1796. Thus, she would have lived for more than eighty years.</p>
