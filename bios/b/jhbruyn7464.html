<strong>Jan Hendrix Bruyn</strong></a> probably was born before 1640. He was known as "Jan  Hendricks" and/or "Jan Hendrix de Bruyn."

<p>He may have been in Albany in 1666 when a "Jan Bruin" was noted in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> records. From that time on, he was involved in a variety of cases before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a>.

<p>His wife was mentioned but not identified in December 1670. He also had servants and was identified as the co-guardian of the children of Jan Rinckhout in 1668. During the 1670s, his wife appeared in court a number of times. However, she never was identified by name. 

<p>In September 1675, the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> received a <a href="../m/humarselis726preg.html">petition</a> from <a href="../m/humarselis726.html">Huybertie Marselis</a> regarding the paternity of her unborn child. After a lengthy court battle and despite his protestations, Jan Hendrix first was ordered to marry her. As he already was married, he then was directed to pay a large sum for child support and court costs.
 
<p>That issue was among a number of instances that did not endear De Bruyn to the Albany community. During the 1670s, he was branded as an outsider who sought to participate in the Albany <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In 1678, he was forbidden to trade with the Indians because he was a New Yorker. Jan Hendrix replied that he had been an Albany burgher for upward of twenty years. However, the court refused his protest stating that he had failed to keep a "fire and light" in his Albany house for over a year.   

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#7464">1679</a>, he was included on a census of Albany householders taken to solicit support for maintaining the <a href="../../map/map1676.html">stockade</a>. At that time, he was assessed more than his actual wealth and holdings would indicate. In 1681, <a href="../v/acviele6777.html">Arnout Viele</a> was living in his Albany house. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#7464">1684</a>, his Albany taxes for two houses were in arrears.

<p>In addition to a number of Albany houses and properties, de Bruyn owned <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> behind <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>, in the Hudson River, and to the southward as well.  

<p> By 1690, Jan Hendrix had settled in New York. In December he was commissioned Major in the militia by insurgent leader <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a>.

<p>Jan Hendrix Bruyn filed a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> in December 1702. At that time, he called himself as a New York City merchant. He identified his wife (but not by name), Johannes, and a number of nieces and nephews as heirs. The will passed probate in June 1709.</p>
