          <P> The <a href="#sources">story</a> of the Albany Bleeckers begin with 
            the life of <a href="jjbleecker2.html">Jan Janse</a>, who emigrated 
            from Holland in 1658. Settling in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>, 
            he prospered in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. His 
            marriage to <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">Margarita Van Woert</a> 
            in 1667 produced ten children and laid the foundation for the family's 
            success in America for generations to come.</p>

          <p>The second generation built on Jan Janse's success - with two sons, 
            <a href="jjbleecker199.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="rjbleecker227.html">Rutger</a> 
            reaching the Albany apex - joining their father as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayors</a> 
            of the city. At the same time, Jan Janse's daughters and granddaughters 
            married sons of prominent regional families.</p>

          <p>Although the Bleecker family continued to grow and extended far beyond its 
            Albany base, in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a> four 
            Bleecker households were prominent in the city. That number grew to 
            six in <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a> and to nine Bleecker-named 
            households by 1790. Clustered chiefly in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
            ward</a>, those households placed the family among the most numerous 
            in the colonial city. By that time, the descendants of Jan Janse had 
            spread across upstate New York and were moving even farther north 
            and west!</p>

          <p>The 87 individual Bleecker family members who lived in Albany before 
            <a href="../../criteria.html">1800</a> constituted one of the most 
            influential families in the city. The family business soon extended 
            beyond fur trade to include other commodities that supplied the settlers 
            of an emerging <a href="../../map/johnsonmap.html">region</a> and 
            the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">forts</a> that protected them. 
            Trade with the Indians made the Bleeckers prominent members of the 
            <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>, often 
            called on as interpreters, and frequently out in the Indian country 
            where several Bleeckers established frontier homes.</p>

          <p>Jan Janse's success in the fur trade led him to extensive land holdings. His 
            sons and their sons built on that legacy - making the family prominent 
            patentees and landholders throughout the Hudson-Mohawk region. <a href="jorbleecker201.html">John R. Bleecker</a> surveyed many of those lands and his <a href="../../im/im1767.html">maps</a> 
            represent important historical resources - some of which have been 
            engraved and widely reproduced.</p>

          <p>Although the Bleeckers have disappeared from the Albany phone book, 
            the Bleecker name has become part of the Albany folk tradition with 
            <a href="http://www.digitalballparks.com/Eastern/Bleecker_640_1.html">Bleecker</a> <a href="#fan"><b>*</b></a> <a href="http://www.ballparkreviews.com/albany/bleecker.htm">Stadium</a>, Bleecker Street, the Harmanus Bleecker Library building, 
            Bleecker Terrace Apartments, and the Bleecker Cafe still important 
            landmarks on the community landscape. </p>

<P><a name=sources></a><b>Sources:</b> We still search for a comprehensive printed family history and for a useful website since the once-useful postings of Jim Boulden have been <a href="http://ourworld.cs.com/Jiboulden/Homepage.html">de-activated</a>. Genealogical material follows the work of <a href="../../fhg.html#pfs">Jonathan Pearson</a> - some of which is <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyalbany/pearson/A-B.html">available online</a>. 

<p>The initial <a href="../../famrecon.html">reconstitution</a> program undertaken by intern <a href="../staff/nmbio.html">Nan Mullenneaux</a> during 2001 identified 87 Bleecker family members who met the <a href="../../criteria.html">criteria for inclusion</a> in our study population.

<p><a name=fan>Built during the 1930s, Bleecker Stadium is surely a historic place. However, I do admit that my affinity for the old bowl stems largely from my own experiences playing and coaching there and from watching my daughter tearing up the Bleecker turf as well!</p></font size>
