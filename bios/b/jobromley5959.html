<P>Referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, in 1767, the name <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Bromley</strong></a> (John Brumley) was listed as a private on the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#5959">roster</a> of an Albany militia company. We believe that individual was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in September 1745. Thus, "Johannis" was the eldest son of <a href="wmbromley5965.html">William</a> and Lena Boom Bromley. This person probably would have been named for his <a href="jobromley5957.html">grandfather</a> - a former garrison soldier and the Albany <a href="bromley.html">Bromley</a> patriarch. He grew up in a large family in the modest first ward home his father had rented from the city of Albany.

<p>In December <a href="#1763">1763</a>, the name "John Brumly" appeared on a muster roll of "New Yorkers" under the command of Capt. Richard Rea.

<p>In March <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=%22john+cortney+and+john+bromley%22&source=bl&ots=wyhLdRvcgt&sig=INFqtZGOARCBDwkv8RgUgreGgvs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-puLops3JAhXDGx4KHfd-CvgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20cortney%20and%20john%20bromley%22&f=false">1768</a>, the "<a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">City Records</a>" noted that John Bromley and John Courtney "acquired" the Albany/Greenbush <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> for one year. The public vendue price was set at &pound;35. Perhaps they remained partners over a number of years. 

<p>Following the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, the names of "John Brumbly" and "John Bromley" both were among the enlisted men in the First Regiment of the New York Line. Three more Bromley/Brumbly names appeared on that undated <a href="https://archive.org/stream/newyorkinrevolut00newy#page/19/mode/1up">roster</a> demonstrating a number of  variations encountered in the spelling of the family surname.

<p>Under any likely spelling, the name of John Bromley has not been found among the census of heads of households anywhere in New York State in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>.

      <p>In September 1790, a John Bromley was listed as "dead" and formerly a corporal 
        in the First Regiment ("Wendell's Company"). The <a href="../../sources.html#bb"><i>balloting 
        book . . . </i></a> lists several entries [chiefly related to <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> 
        bounty rights] under his name. However, they probably relate to more than 
        one same-named individual. 
      <p>In <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html">1793</a>, the debts due the estate of a prominent South End butcher included references to "<a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#5959">Bromley</a> & Cortney" and to <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#5959">John Bromley</a> alone.

<p>After those references, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> of "Johannes Bromley" has not yet been encountered in either the community based record or in our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based resources</a>. Well past diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move</a> on for now!</p>
