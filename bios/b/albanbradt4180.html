<P><A href="#sources"><B>Albert Andriesse</B></A> was born in Fredrikstad, Norway in 1607. He probably was the son of Andries and Eva. The family subsequently relocated to Amsterdam, Holland  where there was a substantial Norwegian community. Coming to New Netherland in 1637, he was the patriarch of the <a href="../../bios/b/bradt.html">Bradt family</a> in America.</P>

<P>In 1632, Albert Andriesse married <a href="../../bios/b/anbarents.html">Anna Barents</a> in Amsterdam. At that time, he was twenty-four years old and gave his occupation as "a sailor in the merchant marine." The marriage produced at least eight children born before Anna's death in 1661. About 1663, he married Pieterje Jans, the widow of his former partner. After her death in 1667, his third wife was Geertruy Coeymans Vosburgh - another widow. The last two marriages produced no children!</P>

      <p>Albert Andriesse emigrated to America to serve at <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, 
        a plantation in the upper Hudson Valley. Settling along a steam south 
        of Fort Orange later named "The Normanskill" in his honor, he was a woodcutter, 
        sawyer, and tobacco planter.</p>

<p>Those enterprises and some fur trading brought him success in America. He acquired additional acreage in the upper Hudson and some property at New Amsterdam as well. 
<a href="#self">Distancing himself</a> from the Van Rensselaers (trading and exporting on his own), Albert Andriesse became quite wealthy yet somewhat detached from the evolving center of power emanating from newly established <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. During the third quarter of the 1600s, he was most prominently represented in the Albany community record as a frequent litigant before the local court.</p>   

<p>As his children matured and established their own identities in Albany and the larger region, Albert Andriesse frequently found himself alone. Separated from his third wife in 1670, his biographer characterizes him as "irascible" and of growing concern (we might add embarrassment) to his children. Not totally anti-social, he was, however, one of the elders of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing to <a href="#decline">decline</a>, the old man left the Normanskill and moved into the Albany home of his son,  <a href="dibradt4343.html">Dirck Albertse Bradt</a>. In 1685, his new neighbors asked the court to remove "the old Noorman" as "he throws fire around the house and threatens to burn his son Dirk."</p>

<p>Shy of his eightieth birthday, Albert Andriesse Bradt died in June 1686. His children established this important Norwegian-ancestry New Netherland family in the city of Albany.</p>
