<P><a href="#biography">Johannes Bleecker</a> was born in Albany in 
            1668. He was the eldest son of <a href="../../nnd.html"> New Netherland</a> 
            pioneer <a href="jjbleecker2.html">Jan Janse</a> and his American-born 
            wife, <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">Margaret Van Woert</a> Bleecker.</p>

          <p>Coming of age quickly as the first son in an emerging Albany business family, 
            Johannes Jr. followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur 
            trade</a> - often venturing into the Indian country on Jan Janse's 
            behalf. Over the winter of 1686-87, the eighteen-year-old accompanied 
            <a href="../m/pamcgreg.html">Patrick Mc Gregory</a> and a party far 
            into the wilderness to establish trade with the Ottawas. He was taken 
            prisoner by the French and Senecas. Taken to Montreal and released 
            by the French governor, one year later he had returned to Albany. 
            During those years, he was known as an Indian interpreter.</p>
   
          <p>In 1693, he married Albany native <a href="../c/acoster5969.html">Anna Coster.</a> 
            Over the next twenty-five years, their nine children were baptized 
            in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents 
            were members.</p>

<p>The family settled into a home on the northwest corner of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> and Maiden Lane. Johannes Jr. continued trading and sought to move beyond the shadow cast by his prominent father. His ambition was revealed in the ill-fated foray into the Indian country and also by his willingness to accept <a href="../../inprog.html">patronage</a> from the insurgent/pretender Jacob Leisler.</p> 

<p>Despite impetuous behavior, this native son was able to establish himself as an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#145">mainstay</a>. During the 1690s, Johannes Jr. served on the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council<a/> and as an officer in the </a></a><a/><a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. Groomed for leadership, the provincial governor appointed him recorder of the city in 1700. The next year, he succeeded his father as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany and served for one year.</a></p>

<p>In 1701, he was chosen to represent Albany in the provincial Assembly. He served for a year. Later, he was an Albany property assessor and then census taker for the Five Nations. Although retired from public life, in 1720 he was appointed to the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>.

<p>Johannes Bleecker, Jr. died on December 20, 1738 and was buried in the Dutch 
            church cemetery. His younger brother, <a href="rjbleecker227.html">Rutger</a>, 
            became mayor of Albany in 1726.</p>
