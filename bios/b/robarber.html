<strong>Robert Barber</strong></a> was born in Ireland about 1760. With his older brother, <a href="jobarber7202.html">John</a>, he emigrated to America and arrived in Albany during the 1780s.

<p>He learned the printing trade as an apprentice of <a href="../w/crwebster6841.html">Charles R. Webster</a>. While still a minor, he bought out of his apprenticeship to start his own paper. In May 1788, he began the <a href="../../org/ar.html"><i>Albany Register</i></a> - a new partisan newspaper that sustained an <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html">A</a>ntifederal point of view. This venture of "Robert Barber & Co." was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=%22robert+barber%22+dissapated&source=bl&ots=2hLrQ_VAav&sig=de3HX1Lgb_MMV9zD3Ug6ugPzM_4&hl=en&ei=WNEGSoioGszgtge6xYH6Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1">said to have been sponsored</a> by "influential Republicans.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7202">1788</a>, the personal property of the Barber brothers was valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> assessment roll within another home. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7202">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html#7202">1800</a>, bachelor Robert probably was accounted for on the census under the houshold of his brother. By that time, John Barber was living in the first ward.

<p>Probably during the 1790s, Robert is said to have become "dissipated" (not well in some unspecified way), left Albany, and went into the country (perhaps to Johnstown). 

<p>Although not a printer by training, John Barber took over operation of <i>The Register</i>, became the official State printer, and ran the business until his death from consumption in 1808. At that time, the Barber's brother-in-law, <a href="../s/sosouthwick.html">Solomon Southwick</a>, assumed control of the printing.

 
<p>Robert Barber died in May 1812 at the age of forty-two. He was buried in the Episcopal burial plot.</p>
