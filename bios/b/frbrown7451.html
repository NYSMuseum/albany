<P>Based on subsequent sources, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Frederick Brown</strong></a> was born prior to 1756. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7451">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household was composed of a couple both born before 1756, two boys, and two girls under the age of ten. However the same resource <a href="../../census1800.html#frbr">configured</a> a second Frederick Brown household also in the second ward that included a younger couple but only one young girl. This sketch of Frederick <a href="brown.html">Brown</a> strives to focus on the older of the two same-named individuals. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In February 1779, Frederick Brown married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Polly Ramsey at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. These Browns appear to have raised a family but we have not yet encountered demographic information for his children.

<p>In March 1785, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">account</a> for eight shillings was paid from the city treasury.

<p>The Federal census for New York State in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> configured only the Yonkers household for a Frederick Brown.

<P>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a> his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick Street</a> were valued on the city assessment roll for the second ward. After that, his name has not been encountered in the community-based record.

<p>Missing critical demographic information, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> from the life of Albany resident Frederick Brown.</p>
