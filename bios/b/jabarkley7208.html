<strong>James Barkley</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">B</a>arclay) was born about 1752. We seek information on his background and on how/when he came to Albany.

<p>In November 1788, he married fellow émigré <a href="jabarker7213.html">Janet Barker</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. Beginning a few months after the wedding, the first of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>For the next quarter century, these Barkleys were Albany mainstays. Census returns in <a href="../../census1790.html#7208">1790</a>, <a href="../../census1800.html#7208">1800</a>, and 1810 chart the growth of their small family. Assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7208">rolls</a> valued their <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house and personal property modestly. In 1813, and until his death, James Barkley was listed in the city directory at 59 <a href="../../streets.html#chapel"> Chapel Street</a> 

<p>James Barkley was a well-known <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a>. He was a member and trustee of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. In 1801, he also paid for a grocer's license. 
<p>In 1788 and in 1791, he was listed among the first ward firemen. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA48,M1">1813</a>, he was identified as the "City 
Superintendent" and as  a member of the city Council. 

<p>In December 1811, an Albany newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA31,M1">reported</a> that a "spaniel dog, belonging to James Barclay, was taken out of a room in an uninhabited house in Albany where he was accidentally confined for 42 days without food or drink. Dog was alive, though too weak to stand. He was recovered."

<p>James Barkley died in January 1814 at the age of sixty-two and was buried in the Presbyterian cemetery plot. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in November. Widow Janet carried on in their 59 Chapel Street home until her passing in 1818.
