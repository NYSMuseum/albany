<P><a href="#sources"><b>Engeltie Beekman</b></a> probabaly was born during the first decade of the eighteenth century. From the names of her children, she may have been the daughter of Martin and Susanna Jans Beekman.</p>


<p>In February 1716, she married <a href="../e/teegb4543.html">Teunis Metselaer</a> [Egberts] at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1736, her eleven children had been baptized in Albany.</p>

<p>The couple lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html">third ward</a> where Teunis was a freeholder, served as firemaster and constable, and was elected assistant alderman in 1722.</p> 

<p>Following the baptism of her twins in June 1736, the name of Engeltie Beekman Egberts dropped from Albany rolls! Prior to that, she had witnessed a few baptisms at the Albany church. She also may have been the sister of Rachel Beekman.</p>
