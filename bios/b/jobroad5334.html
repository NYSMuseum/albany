<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jonathan Broadhurst</b></a> was born about 1670. Subsequent documents tell us he was from Derrington, England. </p>


<p>His name first appeared on Albany rolls in April 1696 when he married <a href="cabens7322.html">Catharina Bensen</a> - the widow of Rynier Schaets. Two years later he joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps their son was christened in Albany in September 1699.</p>

      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#044">1697</a>, his Albany house including 
        four children was configured on the census. At that time, he was identified 
        as of "English" heritage. Two years later, he joined with his neighbors 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5334">swearing allegiance</a> to 
        the King of England.</p>

<p> In June <a href="../../doc/cc/0627699.html">1699</a>, Broadhurst was among those cited for <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> without possessing the "freedom of the city." However, he subsequently served the community as juror, constable, firemaster, contractor, and was named <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany in 1701.</p>

<p>Jonathan Broadhurst was last heard from in 1705 when <a href="../c/jcollins.html">John Collins</a> petitioned the city council for the right to buy a lot next to that of Broadhurst.</p>
