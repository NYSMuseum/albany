<strong>Egbert Bradt</strong></a> was born in July 1702. He was the son of <a href="anbbradt4197.html">Anthony B.</a> and <a href="../e/wiegb4544.html">Willempie Teunisz</a>  Bradt. His father was a businessman and civic leader who raised his family in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany.</p>

<p>About 1722, he married <a href="../l/ellansing3234.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a>. By 1745, nine children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and pewholder.

<p>Egbert Bradt was a <a href="../../census1756.html#224">cooper and carpenter</a> who lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He served as firemaster, <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4347">qualified</a> to vote, and was elected assistant alderman first in 1746. In September 1747, he witnessed the <a href="../r/piryckman1983.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor.
 
      <p>As he aged through his sixties and seventies, this Albany mainstay took a more 
        passive role in community affairs. He shared his home with boarders including 
        newcomer <a href="../w/bewashburn6816.html">Bethuel Washburn</a> who 
        married Bradt's <a href="../l/geerlansing3310.html">widowed</a> daughter-in-law. 
      <p>After living into his mid-eighties, Egbert Bradt died in March 1787 and was buried in the church cemetery. His widow survived for a number of years afterward.</p>
