<strong>Joshua Bloore</strong></a> was  an Albany-based merchant and partner of <a href="thbarry1821.html">Thomas Barry</a> in the years preceeding the <a href="../../or/or.html">American Revolution</a>.</p>


<p>About November 1771, he married Margaret Brudnel (Britnal). By that time, he had joined <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church where he and his wife were identified as <a href="../../coerec1771.html">communicants</a> and previously as "from Mr. <a href="../t/jotunn1683.html">Tunnicliff's</a>." They also were called  "English people." In 1774, he was St. Peter's vestryman.</p> 

<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, "Barry & Bloore" was contributing to the relief of Ticonderoga. But in September 1775, the partners were held up to ridicule by the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> - probably for profiteering. After that, Bloore's situation in Albany would begin to deteriorate.</p>

<p>In February 1778, Bloore applied to Governor George Clinton for permission to take his family to England. Later he acted as  <a href="../../cddc.html">bailsman</a> for a number of people until he was imprisoned himself and asking to be exchanged. However, he remained in the community. In 1779, his first ward property was heavily <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">taxed</a>.</p>

<p>After the war, Bloore advertized in the revived <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. Calling himself a merchant at 7 State Street, he offered "the best Scotch snuff manufactured" and also sold saw mill irons. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7363">1790</a>, his lower <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> home included seven people.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, his name and that of his family dropped from Albany rolls. However, he probably was the "Joshua Bloore" who came to Albany from Manchester, England and was a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nysarato/Sylvester/chap30.html">prominent resident</a> of Ballston Spa during the 1790s.</p>
