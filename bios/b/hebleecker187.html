<strong>Henry Bleecker</strong></a> was born in September 1763. He was the son of <a href="hebleecker186.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../c/cacuyler374.html">Catharina Cuyler</a> Bleecker. He grew up in the <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home of a prominent businessman and city official. His older <a href="nibleecker222.html">brother</a> was his beusiness partner while the <a href="mgtbleecker213.html">two</a> adult <a href="cableecker160.html">sisters</a> named in their father's <a href="../../sources.html#en">will</a> married Albany businessmen. Their father died in 1787 but their mother survived until 1808.

<p>Like his older brother, he received a Revolutionary War <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#187">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia company. In May 1780, Henry Bleecker of Albany was identified as a clerk serving under commissary Colonel <a href="../c/jacuyler539.html">Jacob Cuyler</a> in Albany. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on the extent of the actual wartime service of this individual with an often-encountered name.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#187">1788</a>, his personal property was valued under the house of his mother. In <a href="../../census1790.html#374">1790</a>, he was included her <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household. In 1799, he had taken over as the head of the household. The next year, his budding family was configured on the <a href="../../census1800.html#187">census</a>.  Over the next three decades, he was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&q=bleecker#PPA56,M1">prominent</a> merchant with a residence at 43 North Pearl Street. He also <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">owned</a> a storehouse on Market Street. His business partner was his older brother, <a href="nibleecker222.html">Nicholas</a>. 

<p>In June 1799, Henry was in his mid thirties when he married a slightly younger <a href="../m/elmetcalf.html">Elizabeth Metcalf</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over then next decades, their children were christened in the Albany church.

<p>Henry Bleecker died in November 1837. He had lived seventy-five years. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate a month later. His widow survived until 1852.
