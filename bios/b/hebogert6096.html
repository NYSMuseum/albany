<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Bogert</b></a> was born in July 1724. He was the only son of the marriage of <a href="cobogert6063.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../o/dooo419.html">Dorothe Oothout</a> Bogert. He may have been called "Hendrick" perhaps to differentiate him from a slightly younger and more well-known contemporary known as <a href="hebogert6097.html">Henry I. Bogert</a>.</p>


<p>Hendrick married <a href="../vs/envschaick4026.html">Engeltie Van Schaack</a> in June 1751. By 1755, two daughters had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage ended when Engeltie died in January 1764. Henndrick does not appear to have re-married.</p>

<p>Like his father, Hendrick Bogert was a carpenter and an <a href="../../census1756.html#277">Albany mainstay</a>. In 1755, he was named to <a href="../../wills/willcobogert6063.html">inherit</a> his father's carpentry tools and <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home. The modest home on Market  Street was enumerated on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6096">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of qualified voters in the city of Albany.</p>

<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he would have been in his fifties and too old for military service. He did contribute for the relief of Ticonderoga and later was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">exempted</a> from militia service.</p> 

<p>Hendrick Bogert filed a will which passed probate in December 1788. An <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html">extensive inventory</a> detailed his holdings and accounts and provides insight into the extent of his business.</p>
