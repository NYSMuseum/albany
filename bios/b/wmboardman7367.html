      <P><a href="#sources"> <strong>William Boardman</strong></a> was born about 1770. 
        By the <a href="#1793">1790s</a>, he was living in Albany. We seek defining 
        information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path 
        to Albany. In 1790, two same-named individuals were listed on the <a href="http://us-census.mooseroots.com/d/b/William-Boardman">census</a> 
        in Connecticut <a href="../../yankinv.html">and</a> also in Massachusetts.
      <p>By the late 1790s, his children with <a href="../p/elpangburn.html">Elizabeth Pangburn</a> were being christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. By 1810, their family included four young boys. In 1808 and later in December 1835, their daughters were buried in the First Presbyterian cemetery plot.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7367">1800</a>, his first ward household was configured on the Albany census. It included a young couple and two young boys. Subsequent censuses account for the growth and aging of his family. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, the Albany census counted ten people in his household.

      <p>The first city directory in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22william+boardman%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=boardman&f=false">1813</a> 
        (and several subsequent editions) identified him as the sexton of the 
        Presbyterian with an address of "14 Capitol." By 1820, William Boardman 
        was listed simply as a resident of "Eagle [Street]." In 1830, his residence was given 
        as "near Capitol Place." No mention of him is made in the <a href="../../presbyterian.html#sources">standard 
        history</a> of the First Presbyterian church. However, by that time, other 
        similarly named individuals were at-risk in the city and its hinterland. 
		
<p>William Boardman died in April 1835. His death notice <a href="http://booksnow1.scholarsportal.info/ebooks/oca1/8/annalsofalbany10munsuoft/annalsofalbany10munsuoft_bw.pdf">stated</a> 
        that he was "aged 64". At this point, we are unsure of a potential connection 
        of the same-named businessman who co-founded "<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22boardman+and+gray%22+albany">Boardman 
        & Gray</a>" a preeminent Albany piano company in 1837.</p>
