<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob S. Bogardus</strong></a> was born in August 1712. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="shbogardus6387.html">Shibboleth</a> and <a href="../d/andgarmo783.html">Anna De Garmo</a> Bogardus. He was christened at the Dutch church in New York but grew up in the large family of <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> Albany mainliners. Same-named contemporaries dictate that this profile is based mostly on references to "Jacob S. Bogardus."

<p>Perhaps this individual did not marry as family information has not been encountered in our sweep of <a href="../../cbr.html">co</a>mmunity-based resources.


<p>In May 1747, he was paid to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA122&lpg=PA122&dq=%22jacob+s+bogardus%22&source=bl&ots=sugU9y5cTp&sig=ErYr8qVK1037X_eoWIKbK8Vzets&hl=en&ei=lbuhTZ-xDcmD0QHl1_iXBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22jacob%20s%20bogardus%22&f=false">buy</a> firewood on behalf of the Albany government and that it be carried from his sloop to the several quarters of the "king's <a href="../../garrison.html">soldiers</a>." 

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#34">1756</a>, he was identified as a skipper and his house was described on a census of Albany householders taken by the British army. Later that year, he was named executor of the <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus.html">estate</a> of his older brother, "mariner" Pieter Bogardus. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#jabo">1763</a>, Jacob Bogardus was named on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>His name has not been encountered on city-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> rolls. Perhaps he lived with his <a href="cobogardus6361.html">sister</a>, an un-married, contemporary Albany property holder. In September 1775, his account for more than 29 pounds was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA273&lpg=PA273&dq=%22jacob+bogardus%22&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22jacob%20bogardus%22&f=false">paid</a> by the city corporation. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6375">1790</a>, he was alone in his second ward house. After that, his name <a href="../qqqq.html">appears</a> to have dropped from Albany rolls.</p>
