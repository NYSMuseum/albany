      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Bernardus Bradt</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> 
        Barnardus) was born in September 1704. He was the son of Albany-based 
        trader <a href="dabradt4340.html">Daniel</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3232.html">Elizabeth 
        Lansing</a> Bradt. His father died during the 1720s. 
      <p>In January 1735, Bernardus married eastern Albany native <a href="../vv/cavvechten2397.html">Catharina 
        Van Vechten</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1750, seven children had been christened in Albany. 
      <p>Bernardus Bradt was an <a href="../../census1756.html#35">overland transporter</a> 
        and contractor who set up his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> where he was identified as a freeholder as early as <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4335">1742</a>. 
        In 1737, he is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have occupied a 
        property on <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a> 
        at the foot of <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows hill</a> with 
        Gerrit Bradt. 
      <p>He also held <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> in the 
        eastern part of Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">County</a>. In 
        October 1741, <a href="../vv/jovvechten2527.html">Johannes Van Vechten</a> 
        conveyed "all of his lands" in the "<a href="../../na/hoos.html">Hosick</a>" 
        Patent to Bradt and two other sons-in-law. Bradt's heirs still held claim 
        to that parcel into the nineteenth century. During the 1760s, he held 
        a lease for land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> and 
        another one in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
        In 1767, he sold three slaves. 
      <p>He performed some services for the city, was elected assistant alderman 
        - first in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1746">1746</a>, and was the captain 
        of the city's <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company during 
        the 1750s and 60s. In 1751, he acquired a share of the cross-river <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>. 
        He held that franchise for many years before his son, <a href="dabradt4222.html">Daniel</a>, 
        joined him in 1758. His daughter, <a href="mabradt4268.html">Maria</a>, 
        married future ferryman <a href="../l/thlottridge414.html">Thomas Lottridge</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>In his seventies at the onset of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, 
        he had relinquished his militia commission. His support of the American 
        cause was nominal and probably only financial. However, his sons were 
        counted among Albany's patriots. After his holdings were assessed on the 
        tax lists for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, the 
        name of Bernardus Bradt <a href="http://worldconnect.genealogy.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=vanpatten&id=I04719">appears</a> 
        to have dropped from Albany rolls. 
      <p>According to subsequent <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=K_w2AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=barnardus+bradt&f=false">litigation</a>, 
        "Barnardus Bradt" had died in 1786. </p>
