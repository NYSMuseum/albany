      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Henry I. Bogert</b></a> was born in October 1729. 
        He was the oldest surviving son of Albany residents <a href="isbogert6066.html">Isaac</a> 
        and <a href="../o/heoo435.html">Hendrickie Oothout</a> Bogert. He grew 
        up in a carpenter's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/hebogertea.jpg" align=left border=1 vspace=2 hspace=6 width=200 height=282 alt="Henry I. Bogert - 1805"></a>In 
        February 1758, he married Albany native <a href="../m/bamarselis634.html">Barbara 
        Marselis</a>. That union produced five or more children who also were 
        baptized in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was 
        a member and later an <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">officer</a>.</p>
      <p>Henry Bogert derived his income from several sources. From his home near 
        the waterfront, he may have practiced the carpenter's trade. At the same 
        time, he skippered a sloop that was called the <i>Magdeline</i> in 1776. 
        By that time, he was drawing maps for the city of Albany and other clients.</p>
      <p>This Henry Bogert also found time to perform other civic duties. After 
        serving as a constable, in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a> he 
        was first elected assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. Four months after being sworn in as Albany's first official 
        <a href="../../inprog.html">surveyor</a> in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a>, 
        he was elected alderman - serving in that post for several years.</p>
      <p>He signed the Sons of Liberty <a href="../../solconst.html#6097">Constitution</a> 
        in 1766. In 1775, he was elected to represent the first ward on the Albany 
        <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> and served on 
        that board throughout its lifetime. In 1776, he <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">signed</a> 
        the "General Association." This Patriot stalwart carried personnel, prisoners, 
        and supplies on his sloop - turning over operation of the <i>Magdeline</i> 
        to his teen-aged <a href="jobogert6121.html">son</a> at the end of 1776. 
        He also <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#6097">served</a> the Continental 
        army as Assistant Deputy Quartermaster General procuring and shipping 
        needed materials in all directions. After the war, he received a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land 
        bounty right</a>.</p>
      <p>After the war, he resumed his duties as city surveyor - teaching his 
        sons well enough to succeed him in the near future. Henry was given a 
        supervisory role in the weighing and docking of vessels at Albany, and 
        served on a number of commissions as well. His comfortable <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6097">home</a> 
        in the <a href="../../census1800.html#6097">heart</a> of the city was 
        an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#6097">landmark</a>. Later, he 
        moved north to what became 181 North Market Street. 
      <p>Barbara Marselis Bogert passed on at the end of 1816 thus ending a marriage 
        of fifty-eight years. By that time Henry I. Bogert was living with the 
        family of his son <a href="gebogert6092.html">Gerrit</a> at 124 Hudson 
        Street. He died in June 1821 in his ninety-second year. Letters of Administration 
        were issued on his estate in September. He was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> 
        in the Washington Park Cemetery. In 1867, he was re-interred at Albany 
        Rural Cemetery. </p>
