<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Robert Bruce</strong></a> lived in Albany during the last three decades of the eighteenth century. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In June 1762, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> of Rob't Bruce <a href="../../sources.html#uny">appeared</a> on the Albany muster roll of <a href="../d/jodgarmo934.html">John De Garmo</a>'s militia company. Bruce was then twenty-nine and called a native of England. Additional period military-based <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/collectionsforye24newyuoft/collectionsforye24newyuoft_djvu.txt">information</a> on this name appears online.

<p>In January 1770, he was made a member of the Albany night watch. He was paid occasionally from the city treasury into 1774.

<p>Not finding his name on the rolls of Albany's wartime commmittees, we seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">activities</a> during the War for Independence.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">1779</a> his house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was valued on the city assessment rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7462">1788</a>, he was among those whose modest personal property was valued at the end of the second ward assessment.

<p>In June of 1788, he married the widow Christy Cummings at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. Perhaps, it was his second marriage. At that time, both partners were living in the city of Albany. No children appear to have been christened in the extant records of contemporary <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7462">1790</a>, the first Federal census showed his second ward household with only a man and a woman.

<p>In 1799, only his first ward lots were noted on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment</a>.

<p>After that point, the name of Robert Bruce has not yet been found in the community-based record. Whether he was related to the other Albany people surnamed Bruce has yet to be determined. Missing defining information, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
