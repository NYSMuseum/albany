<strong>Michael Bassett</strong></a> was born about 1705. He was the son of Michael Bassett of New York.  His mother may have been Helena Alst and his father <a href="../../sources.html#bf">may have</a> been the mariner who was admitted to the freemanship of New York in 1725. 

<p>In April 1728, he married Albany native <a href="../s/elscher5459.html">Elizabeth Schermerhorn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1750, eleven children had been christened in Albany where he received services and was an occasional baptism sponsor. 

<p>This Bassett family made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> - perhaps in a house recently vacated by Elizabeth's <a href="../s/coscher5455.html">father</a>.

<p>Michale Bassett was a <a href="../../census1756.html#157">gunsmith</a> who also had charge of the Albany <a href="../../fireengine.html">fire engine</a>. He was paid a number of times from the city treasury. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1728">1728</a> and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1739">1739</a>, he was a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In 1738, he was named "resident agent" in the Seneca country. In 1743, he was named Albany gatekeeper. From the 1720s to 1780s, he was an Albany mainstay whose modest holdings were valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#7257">1763</a>, his name appered on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>In his seventies at the outbreak of <a hre="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, perhaps Michael Bassett "the elder" was one of the gunsmiths appointed to "appraise arms" by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> in May 1776.

<p>Michael Bassett died in the winter of 1786 and was buried on February third.</p>
