<P>
Born in Holland, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Gerrit Bancker</strong></a> was in New Amsterdam as early as 1655. At that time he was identified as a merchant's servant. Soon, he removed to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he found success as a trader and landholder.

<p>By 1660, he had married <a href="../vd/elvepps.html">Elizabeth Van Epps</a> - the daughter of a frontier trader. In August of that year, she was pregnant and the victim of an <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">alleged</a>  beating. Over the next three decades, their marriage produced a number of children who became Albany residents. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
<a name=prop>
<p>He owned several houses and lots within the Albany stockade and held parcels in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and beyond as well. He also was an early proprietor of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> with village house and farm (bouwerie) lots which remained in the family for a decade after his death.
 
<p>In 1668, he returned to Amsterdam on business leaving Lysbeth in charge of his estate.


<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6467">1679</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#6467">1681</a>, and <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#1">1689</a>, his name appeared on censuses of Albany householders. His house was on the South side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> below Pearl.


<p>Gerrit Bancker filed a <a href="../../wills/willgebancker.html">will</a> in November 1690. It named his wife as heir. He died in February 1691. His son, <a href="ebancker6454.html">Evert</a>, was appointed mayor of Albany in 1694.</p>
