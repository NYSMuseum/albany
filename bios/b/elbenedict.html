<P>Perhaps future Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Elisha Benedict</strong></a> was <a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Benedict-883">born</a> in Danbury, Connecticut in April 1736. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Several same-named contemporaries complicate our ambition of filling out the biography of this individual.

<p>An Elisha Benedict <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BubSxkZTytoC&pg=PA275&lpg=PA275&dq=%22benedict,+elisha%22&source=bl&ots=Q3JnDABq2P&sig=1Um5sl_9udOGqLmQjpuRCgenzJ8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mKWdVKqkEoulyQSz-4KgAw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22benedict%2C%20elisha%22&f=false">served</a> in the Connecticut Militia during the French & Indian War.

<p>Perhaps his wife was <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/h/a/t/Jeffrey-Allan-Hattersley-El-Dorado-Hills/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0889.html">one</a> Jerusha Starr. One or both of them had been married previously. Their union produced several children <a href="http://www.genealowiki.com/bin/view.cgi/Benedict/ElishaBenedict1736">perhaps</a> between 1758 and 1767, Perhaps a namesake son (Elisha Benedict, Jr. - born 1760) also served in the militia and in the Revolutionary army.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his house and property on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> were valued on the Albany assessment roll.

      <p>In March 1771, he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=%22petition+of+elisha+benedict%22&source=bl&ots=wyeLdRtbls&sig=u-F6MqoEk8sPQKsOz8jNl1KisHg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=64ydVOmpJISMyASWooKQAw&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22petition%20of%20elisha%20benedict%22&f=false">petitioned</a> 
        the city council to be appointed marshall. The Council replied that he 
        would be considered. 
      <p>In December 1771, his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA225&lpg=PA225&dq=%22petition+of+elisha+benedict%22&source=bl&ots=wyeLdRtbls&sig=u-F6MqoEk8sPQKsOz8jNl1KisHg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=64ydVOmpJISMyASWooKQAw&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=benedict&f=false">account</a> for &pound;1:1 was among those paid from the city treasury.

<p>In June 1772, he acquired/obtained "Lot 4" (200 acres) in Ballstown "township" from Albany and regional developer <a href="../f/gysfonda3782.html">Gysbert Fonda</a>.

<p>By 1775, he had <a href="../../na/na.html">moved</a> to <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Ballstown</a> where he successfully petitioned the Albany Committee to raise a company. He later was identified as captain of an Albany County company. In June 1775, he <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n103/mode/2up">carried</a> the Association document from Albany to Ballstown. He appears to have been a committee member from Ballstown. However, his name <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n957/mode/2up">rarely</a> appeared in the minutes.

<p>However, his <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n139/mode/2up">wartime</a> active military role is more fully <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=HHXxb14EcwsC&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=%22elisha+benedict%22+albany&source=bl&ots=9oYi4Mnb6U&sig=Go2Bdi-cfSuwTsGQcT1zN2wg0-k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gvWaVKbqHfjGsQSh1IHQDw&ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22elisha%20benedict%22%20albany&f=false">documented</a>. He also <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=heitman+officers&printsec=frontcover&source#v=onepage&q=benedict+elisha&f=false">served</a> as a Continental officer on the expedition against Canada. At this point, we have confined this exposition to his short term Albany city <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>. We have not followed his more well-documented out-of-Albany activities.

<p>In <a href="http://saratoganygenweb.com/1779BnTx.htm">1779</a>, his name appeared on an assessment roll for Ballstown. 

      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, four heads of household named 
        Elisha Benedict were enumerated on the census for Ballstown. 
      <p>Perhaps this Elisha Benedict died in <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/elisha_benedict_records.ashx?pid=25755891">Canada</a> in <a href="http://www.myheritage.com/family-1_1000015_43697681_43697681/benedict-elisha-benedict-jerusha-benedict-born-starr">1798</a>. </p>
