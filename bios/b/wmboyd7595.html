<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Boyd</strong></a> is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=b4k-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA445&lpg=PA445&dq=%22william+boyd%22+albany&source=bl&ots=NMIv_1xRIt&sig=fEHnK_S-L72QUVuouRsl_-gWruU&hl=en&ei=YcCPS4H9F9Cj8Abcysz2BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CA0Q6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=%22william%20boyd%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have been born in September 1775. He was the son of <a href="joboyd7399.html">John</a> and <a href="../l/anlogan7596.html">Ann Logan</a> Boyd. He probably was born in Albany and grew up in the large family of a newcomer Scottish merchant.

<p>During the 1790s, his father re-located the family to Johnstown where he died in 1799. Perhaps his widow took William back to Albany when she went (probably after 1800) to live with her <a href="../m/pemchench.html">married</a> daughter. 

<p>As a young man, William Boyd is said to have been a sloop captain running between Albany and New York. 

<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, he had established himself as a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a> and jeweller on Steuben and North Market Street - for a time in partnershep with Robert Shepherd. Beginnning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, city censuses configured his small family. Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22boyd+william%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22boyd%20william%22&f=false">1813</a>, city directories identified this Albany mainstay.

<p>He was a member and officer in the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In May 1809, he married Hannah Hook. The marriage produced at least eight children. Both parents were members of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a> and William was a trustee at the time of his death.


<p>In July 1818, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#v=onepage&q&f=false">identified</a> as a silversmith who with his partner engraved a silver plate commemorating the heroism of General Montgomery.

<p>In 1813 and in 1819, he was elected a director of the "Mechanics & Farmers Bank."

<p>William Boyd died in April 1840 at the age of sixty-five.</p>
