<strong>John R. Bleecker, Jr. </strong></a> was born in December 1771. He was the son of Rutger and Catherine Elmendorph Bleecker. Until the 1800s, he was called "John R. Jr." to distinguish him from a widely known and much older <a href="jorbleecker201.html">uncle</a> who acknowledged him by name in the <a href="../../wills/willjorbleecker201.html">will</a> he filed in March 1782..

<p>By October 1800, he had married <a href="elbridgen.html">Eliza Bridgen</a> (aka Atwood) when their son was christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. Perhaps his wife was buried in March 1805 - unless that person was the wife of his prominent uncle. In May 1808, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yTveN16gs2wC&pg=PA380&lpg=PA380&dq=%22john+r.+bleecker%22&source=bl&ots=pZDz9WDfxm&sig=hMeiFSbvRrsgGUEtdevyyDs-obY&hl=en&ei=TGSdSuHXJM-PmAe8iL2kAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#v=onepage&q=%22john%20r.%20bleecker%22&f=false">married</a> "Mrs. Hester Linn" at the Albany Dutch church. A number of his children became prominent citizens including a daughter who married future Governor Horatio Seymour in 1835.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#208">1808</a>, he joined a number of kinsmen and neighbors who were invited to the elaborate funeral of a younger cousin.

<p>This merchant made his home on North Market Street where the third ward census of <a href="../../census1800.html#208">1800</a> first configured his household. Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22bleecker,+john%22&source#v=onepage&q=%22bleecker%2C%20john%20c.%22&f=false">1813</a>, city 
directories identified his home at 90 and then 354 North Market and the store of <a href="barbleecker150.html">Barent</a> (his older cousin) and John R. Jr. at 72 <a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay</a> Street. They also <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">held</a> substantial dock space on the Albany riverfront.


<p>In 1798, he first served as a fire inspector. He later served on the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a>. He was an officer in the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a> and a number of city-based enterprises as well.



<p>This prominent businessman remained a North Market Street fixture for several decades.
  
<p>John R. Bleecker, Jr. was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MUKVfj1OhnUC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22john+r.+bleecker%22&source=bl&ots=5NGEd4_hOr&sig=bfCbMm2yufzZ3q7E8MVFij-J0ig&hl=en&ei=GGqdSpaLOc-EmQeZ_sGlAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7#v=onepage&q=%22john%20r.%20bleecker%22&f=false">dead</a> by May 12, 1849 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were granted on his estate.

The life of John R. <a href="bleecker.html">Bleecker</a>, Jr.   is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 208. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Beginning with the <a href="jorbleecker201.html">grandson</a> of the first Albany 
Bleecker, a number of individuals were known as "John R. Bleecker" across several generations. We urge <a href="../../res/sp.html">caution</a> in seeking to assign qualitative information and offer that in defense of our unwillingness to attempt to fit material into their biographies.
