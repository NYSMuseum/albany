<strong>Abraham Bogert.</strong></a> was born in February 1692. He was the son of <a href="jacbogert6052.html">Jacob C.</a> and  <a href="../q/janq2136.html">Jannetie Quackenbush</a> Bogert.  He grew up in a <a href="../../census1697.html#050">large</a> family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He was called "Abraham Bogert, Sr." to prevent confusion with  <a href="abbogert6072.html">younger</a> and other same-named individuals.

<p>Abraham Sr. does not appear to have married. However, he did witness a number of baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. This younger son may well have lived under his father's roof until Jacob Cornelisse's passing in  April 1725. A few months <a href="../../org/cc.html#1725">later</a>, he was appointed constable for the third ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>, he was named firemaster.

<p>In 1727, Abraham Sr.'s name was on an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CKzhOgmvRWQC&pg=PA374&lpg=PA374&dq=%22abraham+bogart%22+albany&source=web&ots=moeNPJCyfE&sig=kfKg72nSM20a9mTjR4WF41-jwY8">account</a> for mason work done at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Osewgo</a>.  

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6056">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of third ward freeholders. That was the latest reference to him thus far encourntered. 

<p>Abraham Bogert, Sr. was not mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willcobogert6063.html">will</a> filed by his older brother in May 1755.</p>
