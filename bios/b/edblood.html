<P>According to the will he filed in July 1746,  
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Edward Blood</strong></a> was a "gentleman" and "of Albany." That and a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2wjybwOT4HAC&pg=PA322&lpg=PA322&dq=%22edmond+blood%22+albany&source=web&ots=Pq3TXWDyCh&sig=hNhAC3EeShtfqH9N4nx_xovo6eI#PPA322,M1">letter</a> he wrote in 1734 are  the major sources encountered thus far in articulating his life.

<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, his father was Thomas Blood. At some point, his mother was dying in Dublin.  In 1734, Blood was in Albany writing about land his family held in Ireland.

<p>We believe Edward or Edmund Blood was a military officer - perhaps as early as 1711. In October 1724, he was called the commander at "Mount Burnet" [?] when he reported on Albany merchants trading illegally to Canada.

<p>In 1734, he witnessed an indenture involving <a href="../h/hholland8489.html">Henry Holland</a> in Albany. At that time, he was called  "Capt. Edmond Blood" of Albany and was staying/living at Holland's. His wife and daughters then were in Ireland. 


<p>Edward Blood filed a <a href="../../wills/willedblood.html">will</a> in July 1746. It named his four Vandenbergh cousins and left them his entire estate. An inventory detailing silver items and militaria followed its probate a few days later. However, letters of administration were granted to his daughter, Elizabeth (Richard) Williams in 1753.</p>
