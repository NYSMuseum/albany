<strong>Anthony Bogardus</strong></a> was born about 1682. He was the son of Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#6381">mainstays</a> <a href="pibogardus6381.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="wybosch.html">Wyntie Bosch</a> Bogardus. He grew up in a large family in a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Before Anthony came of age, his parents removed to Kingston where his father filed a <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus6381.html">will</a> in 1702 that named Anthony among his heirs.

<p>In March 1704, Anthony married young widow <a href="../k/jaknick1070.html">Jannetje Knickerbacker</a> Lansing at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1721, their marriage had produced seven more children. All but one was christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor. 

<p>In 1702 and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6358">1709</a>, his modest <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was valued on city assessment rolls. He belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6358">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6358">1742</a>, his name appeared on lists of first ward freeholders.

<p>He earned a living from the <a href="../../makers.html#wood">wood</a> trades. In 1713, he made ladders for <a href="../l/rlivingstonjr.html">Robert Livingston, Jr.</a> He was a contractor of the city and also was paid for work done at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>.

<p>Anthony Bogardus filed a <a href="#will">will</a> which identified him as a "ship's carpenter" of Albany. He died in April 1747 and was buried from his church.</p>
