<strong>Thomas Barret</strong></a> was born in November 1742. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="robarret7233.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../m/mamartin.html">Maria Martin</a> Barret. He grew up on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> but lost his mother in 1754. His father died two years later.

<p>In November 1765, he married Albany native <a href="../vz/elvzandt257.html">Elizabeth Van Zandt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage probably was childless. He was a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>After first living with his mother-in-law, his modest home on the corner of <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl</a> and  <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver</a> Streets was an Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">landmark</a> for almost fifty years. He was a cooper who operated a cooperage on a lot near his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7235">home</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7235">1790</a>, his household included his wife, a boy, and two slaves. A decade later, the <a href="../../census1800.html#7235">census</a> showed only the aging couple living in their first ward home. 

<p>In 1767, Thomas Barret was a private in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In May 1775, he was elected captain in the first ward watch. A month later, he "resigned" that commission. In May 1775, he was paid for making flour casks for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>.

<p>In June 1776, his fortunes took an abrupt turn when this Albany native was one of those loyalists <a href="../../or/or-be.html">arrested</a> and jailed for drinking to the King's health. At first, he refused to sign the non importation <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">Association</a> but later relented and was released from jail. The nature of his objection was not stated. He may have continued without incident until 1778 when he was among those <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#7235">exempted</a> from military service.

<p>After the war, he was able to resume coopering at his landmark location near the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> meeting house. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1785">1785</a>, he was appointed roadmaster for the first ward and later was paid for services by the city government.    



<p>Thomas Barret filed a <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> in January 1788. He died in December 1813. The will passed probate in March 1818.</p>
