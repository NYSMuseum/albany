<P>This sketch organizes material on the younger of <a href="jobrown.html">two</a> Albany residents named <a href="#sources"><strong>John Brown</strong></a>. Both of them lived in the city during the late 1790s and/or afterwards. Based on his listing on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#7455">1800</a> and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, this individual was born between 1774 and 1785. In 1800, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household included a similarly aged couple, a young boy, and one slave. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, the census accounts for the aging of the adult male, a younger female, four additional males, a young girl, and a slave. At least two Albany birth scenarios are possible for the late 1770s. However, we seek defining information on the his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In 1794 <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">and</a> 1795, John Brown was identified as the city watchman. But, probably those refer to the <a href="jobrown.html">elder</a> same-named individual

<p>In March 1799, a John Brown married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Jane Brown at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, none of their children were christened there over the next decade.

<p>In April 1800, John Brown <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">paid</a> $12 for a grocer's license. Perhaps he was the grocer listed in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1813ad">city directory</a> in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22brown+quay%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=brown%20quay&f=false">1813</a> at 49 <a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay</a>. However, at least two other same-named individuals were identified at different addresses in subsequent directories
. 
<p>Still missing critical demographic information, and after our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a>-based resources, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany grocer John Brown.</p>
