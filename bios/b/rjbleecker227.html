          <P><a href="#biography"><B>Rutger Janse</B></a> was born in Albany in 
            1675 - the son of blacksmith-turned-trader <a href="jjbleecker2.html">Jan 
            Janse</a> and his wife <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">Margarita 
            Van Woert</a> Bleecker. He followed his father and brothers in the 
            <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> - an ambition that often took 
            him beyond Albany and into the Indian country.</P>

          <P><A href="#portrait"><IMG align=right alt="Rutger Janse Bleecker" border=1 hspace=8 src="../../images/jpg/rutgerjanse.jpg" vspace=8 width=200></A>Settling 
            in Albany by 1712, at age thirty-seven he married <A href="../s/caschuyler1241.html">Catharina 
            Schuyler</A> - the thirty-four-year-old widow of Mayor Johannes Abeel. 
            Already the mother of six, she gave birth to four Bleecker children 
            between 1713 and 1720. This middle-aged couple lived in her house 
            on <A hef="streets.html#market">Market Street</A> where they soon 
            became Albany <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#227">mainstays</a>. 
            In 1714, he became a deacon of the Albany <A href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</A> where he and his wife were frequent baptism sponsors.</P>

<P>Settling in to the Albany end of an extensive family-based <a href="../../peace.html">peacetime</a> trading network, Rutger Janse became quite wealthy. With wealth came <A href="../../cityfathers.html">civic responsibility</A>. He was appointed city <A  href="../../corporation.html">recorder</A> in 1725 and <A href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany in 1726. He held the mayoralty until 1729. Over the next decade, he was commissioned as one of the Albany <A href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</A>. After 1740, he retired to his riverside home.</P>

<P>Rutger Janse Bleecker wrote a <a href="../../wills/willrjbleecker227.html">will</a> in January of 1756 which stated he was "of frail body." He mentioned his dead wife, Catharina, and three surviving children. His estate included personal and real property as well as the lands left by his brother Nicholas. He died that summer and was buried under the Albany church on August 5, 1756. He was eighty-one years old.</P>

          <P>Two of Rutger Janse's children, <a href="jorbleecker201.html">John R.</a> and <A href="mgtbleecker212.html">Margarita</A>, 
            became prominent Albany residents.</P>
