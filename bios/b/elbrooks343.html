<strong>Elizabeth Brooks</strong></a> was born in June 1727. She was the daughter of <a href="jobrooks346.html">Jonathan</a> and Rebecca Tatten Brooks. She was the first child born to a <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> family that took up residence on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>.

<p>Probably in 1753, she married an <a href="#sources">individual</a> named <a href="../h/hilton.html">William Hilton</a>. By 1768, at least seven children had been christened at Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a> - including <a href="../../stpeters.html">St.Peter's</a> where she was a regular baptism sponsor. Her slightly older <a href="anbrooks340.html">sister</a> married Albany resident <a href="../h/pethilton.html">Pet</a>rus Hilton a few years later.

<p>These Hiltons probably settled in Albany near the homes of their families. In <a href="../../census1790.html#wh">1790</a>, the household of a "William Hilton" and his wife was enumerated on the census at the end of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
<p>Called the "wife of William Hilton," Elizabeth Brooks Hilton died in December 1812 at the age of seventy-nine. Perhaps, she was the woman born in 1727 and married to William Hilton about 1753.  </p>

The life of Elizabeth Brooks Hilton is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 343. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from

and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Several William Hiltons are possible spouses for this long-lived Albany native thus cautioning further assigning qualitative information.</p>
