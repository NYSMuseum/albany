<strong>Cornelis Maase</strong></a> probably was born during the 1690s. Perhaps he was the son of <a href="../vb/mcvburen6505.html">Maas Cornelis</a> and <a href="../g/jacgardinier.html">Jacomyntie Gardinier</a> Maase/Van Buren. For the most part, he was known as "Cornelis Maase."

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#1464">1715</a>, he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1464">1720</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1464">1742</a>, and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1464">1763</a>, he was listed as a freeholder living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Most likely, he became head of the third ward <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#jacg">household</a> formerly held by his widowed mother.

<p>He probably did not marry. He was, however, a regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1721">1721</a>, he was appointed firemaster. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1746">1746</a> and '47, he was elected assistant alderman for the third ward.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#297">1756</a>, he was identified as a brazier. During the 1760s, his Albany holdings (including a house, shop, and stables) were accorded  moderate assessments. After the passing of his mother, he lived with his brother <a href="joblo1480.html">John</a> and his family. He owned another house where his brother <a href="jablo1479.html">Jacob</a> lived.

<p>Cornelis Maase Bloomendal filed a <a href="../../wills/willcoblo1464.html">will</a> in March 1761. It named his brothers and sister  and their families as his heirs. At that time, he stated that he was "weak in body." He was dead by January 1770 when the will passed probate.</p>
