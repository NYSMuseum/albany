<P>Family-based <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Cornelisz-74">res</a>ources tell us that <a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Beeck</b></a> was born in December 1644. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers Pieter Cornelisse and Aaltje Willems Beeck then living in  New Amsterdam. Married three times, Elizabeth was an Albany mainstay for most of the second half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>Her first husband was English officer <a href="../s/sisalisbury.html">Silvester 
        Salisbury</a>. That marriage produced at least four children before his 
        death about 1679. His <a href="../../wills/willsisalisbury.html">will</a>, 
        filed in August 1679, had left her his entire estate with instructions 
        for raising their three living children. 
      <p> In 1682, Elizabeth married Albany physician <a href="../vd/cvdyck821.html">Cornelis 
        Van Dyck</a>, a widower with children. That marriage added at least two 
        more daughters before Van Dyck's death in 1686. In October 1691, she then 
        married Captain <a href="gebradshaw.html">George Bradshaw</a>. But he 
        died within a year leaving her a widow for the third time. Calling her 
        his "loving wife," Bradshaw left her the balance of his estate. She was 
        a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
      <p>In November 1673, she purchased a house on what became South Pearl Street 
        from <a href="../p/rpretty.html">Richard Pretty</a>. A few years later, 
        she was identified as the <a href="../../wills/willsisalisbury.html">administrator</a> 
        of the Salisbury estate. At different times, she was involved in a number 
        of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transactions and 
        also served as an Indian interpreter.</p>
		
<p>Called "Mrs. Bradshaw," her home was included on the Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#013">census 
        of households</a> in 1697.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Beeck Salisbury Van Dyck Bradshaw was dead by May 1698 when 
        letters of administration were granted to her son, Francis Salisbury.</p>
