<strong>Maria Bradt</strong></a> was born in January 1722. She was first daughter born to the marriage of <a href="bebradt4213.html">Benjamin</a> and <a href="../r/magryckman1976.html">Magdalena Ryckman</a> Bradt. She grew up in the <a href="../../census1756.html#37">home</a> of an Albany mason who had married the daughter of a prominent brewer and the one-time mayor of Albany.

<p>In December 1742, Maria was still twenty when she married an older <a href="../h/ishansen4952.html">Isaac Hansen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1757, nine children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Hansens began to raise their family in a small house located <a href="../../census1756.html#37">next</a> to that of her father. Isaac Hansen supported them as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">s</a>hoemaker.

<p>Isaac Hansen died in 1758 leaving the thirty-six year old widow with a large and young family.

<p>In 1766 and '67, her second ward house was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> lightly. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4266">1779</a>, her now <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> property was accorded a modest assessment. Throughout, the widow Mary Hansen's holdings also considered her sons. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4266">1788</a>, she was noted under the third ward holdings of her son <a href="../h/behansen4963.html">Benjamin</a>.

<p>Maria Bradt Hansen died in May 1790 as <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">noted</a> in the Hansen family bible. She had lived sixty-eight years - more than the last thirty as a widow.
