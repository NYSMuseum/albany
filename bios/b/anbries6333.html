<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony Bries</b></a> was born about 1670. He was the son of Albany shoemaker <a href="hebries6332.html">Hendrick</a> and Maria De Hooges Bries.</p>


<p>In June 1692, he married brewer's daughter <a href="../r/caryckman1911.html">Catharina Ryckman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1703, six children had been christened at the Albany church where he was a member and deacon.</p>

<p>This Bries family lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where he was a successful <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a>, constable, and contractor of the city. Assessment rolls <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">testified</a> to his wealth. For a decade, his home was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#110">landmark</a>. He also owned a lot south of Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6333">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. In 1700, he was identified as the quartermaster of a troop of Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.</p>

<p>Anthony Bries wrote a <a href="../../wills/willanbries6333.html">will</a> dated November 1702. It named his wife and six children to share a substantial estate. He probably died in November 1704. The will was probated in February 1705. His widow was listed on the assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1911">1709</a>.</p>
