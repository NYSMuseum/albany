<strong>Nicholas Bleecker</strong></a> was born in January 1758. He was the son of <a href="hebleecker186.html">Hendrick Jr.</a> and <a href="../c/cacuyler374.html">Catharina Cuyler</a> Bleecker. He grew up in the middling-size family of a prominent businessman and city offical in a comfortable <a href="../../census1756.html#6">home</a> on Pearl Street. At this point, our exposition is constrained by the existence of several same-named individuals living in Albany and its environs.

<p>This Nicholas Bleecker came of age during the dark days of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. We have not been able to connect him definitively to wartime activities but afterwards he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#222">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>About 1783, he married Staats Island native <a href="../s/costaats4581.html">Neeltie Staats</a>. By 1800, nine children had been christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and pewholders.

<p>He seems to have followed his father in <a href="../../econ/comec.html">business</a> and in community service - appointed firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1778">1778</a> and elected alderman and supervisor several decades later. He also sat on the boards of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Albany Bank</a> and other community-based organizations.  In 1779, he was named heir and co-executor of the <a href="../../sources.html#en">will</a> filed by his father. His <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#222">first home</a> was on Pearl Street either in or near that of his family. In <a href="../../census1790.html#222">1790</a>, his second ward household included five people. By <a href="../../census1800.html#222">1800</a>, he had settled permanently at what became 288 North <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> and was in business with his younger <a href="hebleecker187.html">brother</a>. That census identified him as a <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#1810">slaveholder</a> - although he freed them shortly thereafter.

<p>During those years, he owned a storehouse and other properties associated with his business. He also bought and sold real estate <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/pr/sc18047.pdf">in</a> and beyond Albany.

<p>Nicholas Bleecker lost his wife in 1831. He died in January 1844 at the age of eighty-six. His will passed probate two months later.</p>
