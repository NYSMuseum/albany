<P><a href="#sources"><b>Peter Douw Beekman</b></a> was born in September 1762. He was the eldest son of <a href="gerbeekman3867.html">Gerardus</a> and <a href="../d/andouw2060.html">Anna Douw</a> Beekman. He was named for his grandfather, Captain <a href="../d/pedouw2164.html">Petrus Douw</a>. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a prominent businessman and at the <a href="../d/douw.html">Douw</a> family retreat located across the river.</p>

<p>Coming of age near the end of the war, he served the <a href="../../or/or.html">Revolutionary cause</a>. In April 1783, he signed a receipt for powder delivered to General <a href="../g/pegans.html">Peter Gansevoort</a> from the munitions under the charge of <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a>.</p>
 
<p>By the mid-1780s, he had married a woman perhaps named Hannah. His wife died in July 1805 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church. He probably re-married. Albany censuses showing his households during the early 1800s listed a large number of girls but Peter Beekman's children did not appear to have been baptized in Albany churches.</p>

<p>Initially, he lived in a modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#3926">1800</a>, the census showed that his home included ten young men and five girls under ten. But, within a few years, he had re-located to the north side of Albany and a house overlooking Foxes Creek. During the 1800s, his large and stylish home stood out among the roominghouses located above <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick Street</a>.</p>

<p>City <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> identified Peter D. Beekman as a justice of the peace during the first decades of the nineteenth century.

<p>Peter Douw Beekman died in February 1835 at the age of seventy three. His widow lived until 1849.</p>
