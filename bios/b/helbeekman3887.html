<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Helena Beekman</strong></a> was born in January 1689. She was the daughter of <a href="jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Martense</a> Beekman and his first wife, <a href="../s/macscher5483.html">Machtelt Schermerhorn</a> Beekman. Her mother died when Helena was a year old and her father soon re-married. She grew up in a <a href="../../census1697.html#134">large</a> Albany family that included more than a dozen children from her father's two marriages. 

 
<p>In 1715, she married <a href="../r/toryckman1994.html">Tobias Ryckman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced at least three daughters who were christened in Albany.

<p>These Ryckmans lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Tobias was a prominent brewer and Albany official. Without sons, her daughter's husband, <a href="../t/barte4845.html">Barent H. Ten Eyck</a>, played a more active role in this family's enterprises.

<p>Helena Beekman Ryckman died in September 1744 and was buried from the Albany church. Consequently, she was not named in the <a href="../../wills/willtoryckman.html">will</a> filed by her husband in 1765.
