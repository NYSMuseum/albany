<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jannetje Bogert</strong></a> was born in October 1711. She was the daughter of <a href="pibogert6070.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../f/refonda3770.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Bogert. Named for her grandmother, she probably was the eldest daughter in the large family of <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> mainstays.

<p>In December 1739, she was twenty-eight at the time of her marriage to a younger Albany native <a href="../g/wogroesbeck.html">Wouter Groesbeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1758, their marriage seems to have produced eight children who were christened in the Albany church. She continued to witness baptisms into the 1760s.

<p>At this point we <a href="../qqqq.html">pause</a> because her husband had a number of same-named contemporaries. However, it seems that they <a href="../../albanycounty.html">re-located</a> to Schaghticoke or perhaps Halfmoon from where this Wouter had business with the Albany <a hre="../../corporation.html">C</a>orporation.
<p>We <a href="../../res/guess.html">seek</a> definitive information on the later life and passing of Albany native Jannetje Bogert Groesbeck </p>
