<strong>Margarita Bleecker</strong></a> was born in November 1755. She was the first child born to the marriage of Albany leader <a href="hebleecker186.html">Hendrick Bleecker, Jr.</a> and <a href="../c/cacuyler374.html">Catharina Cuyler</a> Bleecker. She grew up in a businessman's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>In March 1776, she married <a href="../t/hate4815.html">Harmanus Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1796, eight children had been christened in the church where she was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>This Ten Eyck family made its home in a number of locations while Harmanus pursued business and real estate opportunities. By the 1800s, they had settled in on North Market Street. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4815">1790</a>, their second ward home was served by two slaves. In 1802, Margarita was identified with her husband when they sold a lot in the second ward. In 1779, she was named in her father's <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a>.

  <P>Margarita Bleecker Ten Eyck lost her husband in 1828. As late as 1830, widow Margaret was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as the head of a household at 362 North Market Street. She died in September 1834 at the age of seventy nine.</p>
