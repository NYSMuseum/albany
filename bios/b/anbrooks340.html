<strong>Anna Brooks</strong></a> was born in January 1727. She was the daughter of <a href="jobrooks346.html">Jonathan</a> and Rebecca <a href="../../res/sp.html">T</a>atten Brooks who married four months after Anna's birth and then raised a family on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South side</a> of Albany.

<p>About 1756, she married Albany native <a href="../h/pethilton.html">Petrus Hilton</a>, a twenty-eight-year-old widower with children. By 1771, at least six more children had been christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>Her slightly younger <a href="elbrooks343.html">sister</a> had married Albany resident William Hilton a few years earlier.  

<p>Petrus Hilton was a resident of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He was last heard from about 1771. He probably was dead  by 1779 as his property was no longer visible on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">assessment rolls</a> for that year.

<p>Although we have not yet found additional references to Anna as wife or widow, in 1790, Anna Brooks Hilton would have been in her sixties.</p>
