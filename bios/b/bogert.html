<P><a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>-era settlers under the surname of <a href="../../res/sp.html">Bogart/Bogert</a> were prominent in New York City, New Jersey, and throughout the colony of New York. This family is distinct from the <a href="bogardus.html">Bogardus</a> and Vandenbogaert families of New Netherland and early New York!

<p>The <a href="#sources"><b>Bogert</b></a> family of early Albany traces its roots to <a href="cobogert.html">Cornelis</a> and Dirckje Bogert who came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the 1640s. They settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and raised a family. Their son, <a href="jacbogert6052.html">Jacob</a>, married <a href="../q/janq2136.html">Jannetje Quackenbush</a> and raised a large family in their Albany home. </p>
</FONT><a name=pol></a><font face=arial>
<p><a name=sons></a>Jacob's son, <a href="isbogert6066.html">Isaac</a>, was a carpenter who led the family into Albany political circles. His son, carpenter turned sloop owner <a href="hebogert6097.html">Henry I. Bogert</a> (aka Henry Jr.), became politically prominent after mid-century. His sons, Captain <a href="jobogert6121.html">John Bogert</a>, <a href="gebogert6092.html">Gerrit</a>, <a href="isbogert6106.html">Isaac</a>, and Barent built on their father's successes and elevated the family into the professional ranks as well. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, three Bogert houses were listed on the first Federal census in the city of Albany. In <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/albany/18152AlbanyDirectories.txt">1815</a>, five Bogert named households were identified in the city directory as a number of family members held positions of importance in the booming community. 

<p>Early American historian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Henry_Bogart">William Henry Bogart</a> (1810-88) is said to have been a member of this family. However, we are uncertain of the exact connection!
