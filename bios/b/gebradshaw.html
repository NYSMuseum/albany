<P><a href="#sources"><b>George Bradshaw</b></a> was an officer in the Albany <a href="../../garrison.html"> garrison</a> during the latter part of the seventeenth century. Probably born in the British Isles, we seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and precise path to Albany.</p>
		
<p>In December 1689, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1QQLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=%22george+bradshaw%22+1690+independent+company&source=bl&ots=IH-5w8K1c5&sig=1Kw66OmqVI9BWifHz2DPGFdA61E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6HvvU_6mJI_LsQS2rIIo&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22george%20bradshaw%22%201690%20independent%20company&f=false">commissioned</a> lieutenant in the company of Capt. (royal governor) Henry Sloughter to be raised for "service in America." Sloughter arrived in New York in May 1691.


      <p>In 1691, his was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=j-Q1AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%22george+bradshaw%22+officer+albany&source=bl&ots=ay20yrtMrS&sig=sivNu8a_h8cPDn8NyvAEol7yjSw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sEbvU_THNrHKsQTqxILADA&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22george%20bradshaw%22%20officer%20albany&f=false">listed</a> 
        on the provincial register as a member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners 
        of Indian Affairs</a>. 
      <p>He was known as "Captain Bradshaw" and also as an officer in the "Queen's 
        Company" (sometimes called "fuzileers") serving in New York. In January 
        1692, the provincial government instructed him to keep his soldiers at 
        Albany from deserting. By mid-November, the provincial council sought 
        to settle his affairs as George Bradshaw was deceased!</p>
      <p>His first wife was Mary Warran. But in October 1691, he married the widow 
        <a href="../b/elbeeck.html">Elisabeth Beeck</a> Salisbury Van Dyck at 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
<p>The marriage, however, was short-lived. Bradshaw filed a <a href="../../wills/willgebradshaw.html">will</a> in November 1692. Calling himself a "gentleman" of New York, he stated that he was         sick. He reserved part of his estate for the use of his son, Richard. The rest of his holdings was left to his "loving wife, Elizabeth." The will passed probate on January 16, 1693. His widow remained in their Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#013">home</a> until her death in 1698.</p>
