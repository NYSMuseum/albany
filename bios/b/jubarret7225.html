<strong>Judith Barret</strong></a> was born in August 1740. She was the daughter of <a href="robarret7233.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../m/mamartin.html">Maria Martin</a> <a href="../../res/sp.html">Barret</a>. She was one of the older daughters growing up in a large Albany family. She lost her mother in 1754 and her father two years later. Perhaps the six orphaned Barret children were raised in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside home of her <a href="../s/baspoor6525.html">grandmother</a> - the only Barret-named <a href="../../census1756.html#182">householder</a> living in Albany at the time. 

<p>By 1769, she had become the wife of Albany native <a href="../h/pihilton.html">Pieter Hilton</a>. She may have been married at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">S</a>chenectady. Several of her children were christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany where these Hiltons were occasional baptism sponsors.

<p>This Hilton family settled in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#pih">1790</a>, their household included eight family members.

<p>In 1788, she was named among the heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> of her <a href="thbarret7235.html">brother</a>. In 1818, she was referenced at the probate of the will along with her husband and her two surviving and married daughters. 

<p>Judith Barret Hilton would have been about seventy-eight years old at that time. We seek information on her passing.</p>
