<P><a href="#sources"><b>Martina Becker</b></a> was born about 1670. She was the daughter of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> <a href="jjbecker6030.html">Jan Jurrianse</a> and Maria Adriens Becker.</p>


<p>In 1692, she married Irishman <a href="../h/wmhogan4396.html">William Hogan</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the next decade, their five children were baptized in the church where she was a member.</p>

<p>In 1694, she was named co-exeuctor of her father's estate. She also was <a href="../../wills/willjjbecker.html#martina">singled-out</a> as "a most devoted daughter  [who]  from her youth onward rendered great service in the household and to her mother." Martina was bequeathed their house, half of the garden behind the fort, and most of her parents' other personal property.</p>

<p>Hogan was an innkeeper and civil servant who utilized his wife's property to become quite wealthy. The advantaged Martina appears to have been his active partner. Their first ward home was an early <a href="../../census1697.html#026">Albany landmark</a>.</p> 

<p>In September 1732, she filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">joint will</a> with her husband. It declared that they both were in good bodily health and that they both were godfearing people. The will provided for their surviving children and grandchildren. Martina Becker Hogan died in July 1736 and was buried in the Dutch church cemetery. William Hogan died sometime after.</p>
