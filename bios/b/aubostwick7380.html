      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Augustus Bostwick</strong></a> probably 
        was born about 1740. He is <a href="http://www.bostock.net/tree/BostGen/wnames/a/augustus1738neww152.html">said</a> 
        to have been the son of David Bostwick of Stratford, Connecticut and his 
        first wife, Sarah Nichols Bostwick. Perhaps he was related to contemporary 
        Albany resident <a href="hebostwick.html">Henry Bostwick</a> or to other 
        Bostwicks living in the area during his lifetime. We seek defining information 
        on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 
<p>In August 1766, their marriage <a href="http://www.threerivershms.com/marriageD.htm">license</a> identified his wife as <a href="../d/jadoty1877.html">Jane Doty</a>. The marriage may have been childless although one <a href="http://www.bostock.net/tree/BostGen/wnames/a/augustus1738neww152.html">source</a> held that they had two sons born during the 1760s. But, by 1768, they were identified as subscribers and communicants at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. Over his life in Albany, Bostwick was an Anglican <a href="../../coerec1771.html">stalwart</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1764">1764</a>, he was named constable 
        for the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, he 
        was appointed firemaster for the first ward. In 1767, he was a member 
        of <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham C. Cuyler's</a> Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. 
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and 1767, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> property was accorded a modest assessment. 
      <p>Augustus Bostwick may have been dead by the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">outbreak</a> 
        of hostilities in 1775 as his name was not listed in the records of Albany's 
        wartime committees.</p>
      <p>His <a href="../d/jadoty1877.html">widow</a> was named as the head of 
        the household in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a> and 
        carried on in their lower State Street home until the early <a href="../../census1790.html#1877">1790s</a>.</p>
