<strong>Gerrit Bradt</strong></a> was born in January 1702. He was the son of <a href="dabradt4340.html">Daniel</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3232.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Bradt. His father was a trader who raised his family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. However, his father, Daniel B. Bradt, was dead by 1726 and family responsibilities may account for Gerrit's late marriage.

<p>In September 1736, he married silversmith's daughter <a href="../t/mate4897.html">Maria Ten Eyck</a>. She bore one child before her death in 1740.  About 1743, he married Catharina Van Benthuysen. That marriage produced two children. He was affiliated with the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a regular baptism sponsor. 

<p>He lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> and shared a lot at the foot of <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> with his brother, <a href="bebradt4335.html">Bernardus</a>. In 1732, he  was among those who petitioned the city council for permission to dig a well near their dwellings. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1735">1735</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the first ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4231">1742</a>, he was listed among Albany freeholders.

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=theresagaskell&id=I10044">sources</a> tell us that Gerrit Bradt died on June 28, 1754. However, he may have been dead by 1749.</p>
