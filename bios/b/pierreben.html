      <P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referenced variously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Pierre 
        Bennewe</strong></a> is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KBApospew1QC&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=pierre+naturalized+south+carolina&source=web&ots=anIWnhA87C&sig=enQbqmiExr60Tbdsz747E_il1ck#PPA21,M1">said</a> to have been born about 1675. According to family-based information, his father, <a href="http://archive.org/stream/historyofhugueno02bairuoft/historyofhugueno02bairuoft_djvu.txt">Jac</a>ques <a href="../../res/sp.html">Be</a>noit, was naturalized in South Carolina in 1696. The family probably was of <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> background.

<p>However, when "Pierre Benoy" married <a href="../vs/hevschoon5895.html">Hendrickie Van Schoonhoven</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in December 1696, the marriage entry stated that he was from Rochelle. By 1707, six children had been christened at the Albany church where he witnessed a couple of baptisms. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#piben">1709</a>, his name appeared 
        on an assessment ward for probably unspecified property in Albany. That 
        parcel/holding probably was located in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. 
      <P>We seek additional information on the life of Pierre Bennewe<a href="../../res/sp.html">/</a>Benoit<a href="../../res/sp.html">/</a>Binneway. 
        He seems to have passed on by the 1720s.</p>
