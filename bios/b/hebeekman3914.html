<strong>Hendrick J. Beekman</strong></a> was born in April 1718. He was the <a href="../../wills/willjabeekman.html">eldest son</a> of Albany blacksmith <a href="jabeekman3890.html">Jacob</a> and his wife, <a href="../h/dehansen4947.html">Debora Hansen</a> Beekman. Their family <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible12.htm">bible</a> helps document the life cycle of this particular Beekman family. Hendrick Jacobse grew up in a home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>His father died in March 1739 a few months after <a href="../../wills/willjabeekman.html">leaving</a> the house to his wife and then  children. However, Jacob Beekman's will did not pass probate until June 1746.

<p>Hendrick does not appear to have married but may have shared the family home with his widowed mother and younger siblings. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1744">1744</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the second ward. His mother passed away in 1745.


<p>Hendrick Jacobse Beekman died in September 1746 and was buried from the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In May 1747, letters of administration were granted on his estate. He was the brother of future Albany mayor <a href="jojabeekman3866.html">Johannes Ja. Beekman</a>.</p>
