<strong>Catharina Bries</strong></a> was born in January 1700. She was the daughter of <a href="anbries6333.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../r/caryckman1911.html">Catharina Ryckman</a> Bries. She also was <a href="../../res/sp.html">referred to</a> as "Christina." She grew up in a medium-sized <a href="../../wills/willanbries6333.html">family</a> in a trader's <a href="../../census1697.html#110">home</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> but lost her father when she was just four. Two years earlier, she was named in the <a href="../../wills/willanbries6333.html">will</a> filed by Anthony Bries. 

<p>In December 1720, Catharina was just twenty when she  married <a href="../r/gyroseboom1620.html">Gysbert Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 17431, six children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Rosebooms raised their family in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and were Albany mainstays until Gysbert's death in October 1749.
 
<p>Gysbert's <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible28.htm">family bible</a> carefully chronicled the birth of each of their children. In July 1760, it also noted "Catherine Roseboom in heaven sleeping, and . . . buried on a Friday." She had lived sixty years..</p>
