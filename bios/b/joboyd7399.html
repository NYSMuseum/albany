      <P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=b4k-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA444&lpg=PA444&dq=%22john+boyd%22+albany&source=bl&ots=NMIv_1xRIt&sig=fEHnK_S-L72QUVuouRsl_-gWruU&hl=en&ei=YcCPS4H9F9Cj8Abcysz2BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CA0Q6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=%22john%20boyd%22%20albany&f=false">sources</a>, 
        <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Boyd</strong></a> was born in Ulster, 
        <a href="../irish.html">Ire</a>land about 1725. He was of Scottish ancestry. 
        This Albany resident often was referred to as "John Boyd, Sr." 
      <p>About 1757, he is said to have married Agnes or <a href="../l/anlogan7596.html">Ann 
        Logan</a> in Ireland. By 1778, the marriage had produced a daughter and 
        eight sons. They were the founders of the prominent Boyd family of Albany. 
 <p>With his wife and two or three children, he is said to have emigrated 
        to New York in 1762. That same year, he is said to have brought his family 
        to Albany. However, a number of Scottish or Irish natives named "John 
        Boyd" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA919&lpg=RA12-PA919&dq=%22john+boyd%22&source=web&ots=hq0MrgbxF_&sig=7sibr8RsHv3rSzUurCrKg6LWnGQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20boyd%22&f=false">appeared</a> 
        on the rosters of New York <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        regiments in 1761 and afterwards. 
<p>He is said to have been a merchant in Albany (often connected in business to John Rogers, his brother-in-law) although his name is absent 
        from the <a href="../../sources.html#jp""><i>Johnson Papers</i></a> and 
        other likely contemporary <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1762">sources</a>. 
      <p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his Albany property 
        was accorded a modest assessment. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7399">1779</a> 
        and in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7399">1788</a>, his holdings 
        in the third and <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jbh">second</a> 
        wards were valued more substantially. 
<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, this non native merchant was <a href="../../coc.html">accused</a> of illegal trading and of possession of contraband goods. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HGkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA413&lpg=PA413&dq=%22john+boyd%22+albany+committee&source=bl&ots=N820467Nsu&sig=r22pvJ-0XtGS74wJgOMqgsOQnfk&hl=en&ei=mYGSS_TiO5Ca8AbuqsCoBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20boyd%22%20albany%20committee&f=false">confessed</a> to those offenses, was confined, but was later released. He promised good behavior, contributed to the American cause, and posted bail for a number of others.
 
<p>Almost sixty at the end of the war, he seems to have survived intact and turned to supporting his sons as they came of age and sought to make 
        their ways in the postwar region. In May 1786, legal <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">papers</a> identified as an Albany merchant.
		
      <p>The first <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> of 1790 configured 
        his third ward <a href="../../census1790.html#7399">household</a> to include three males over sixteen and two slaves. 
      <p>At least during the 1780s and 90s, he was a member and elder of the Albany 
        <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. Church records for 1793, noted that Boyd had "removed to the country."
<p>In April 1787, he was named co-executor of the estate of newcomer merchant <a href="../g/wmgray.html">William Gray</a> who died a short while afterwards.
		 
<p>About 1793, he is said to have removed his family to Johnstown where he erected a sawmill. 
 
<p>John Boyd died in Johnstown in July 1799. His widow returned to their daughter's 
        Albany home where she died in 1815. She was <a href="http://www.newhorizonsgenealogicalservices.com/cem-ny-fulton-johnstown-oldcolonial.htm">buried</a> 
        alongside John Boyd in the Johnstown cemetery. </p>
