<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Ephraim Bogardus</strong></a> was born in August 1687. He was the son of <a href="pibogardus6381.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="wybosch.html">Wyntie Bosch</a> Bogardus. He was a younger child in the large family of an Albany mainstay who probably relocated to Kingston where he filed a <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus6381.html">will</a> which mentioned Ephraim in 1702. In any event, only Pieter's pasture was valued on the Albany assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6381">1709</a>.

<p>In May 1711, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willcobogardus.html">will</a> filed by his brother <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Cornelis Bogardus who stated that he was about to sail "towards North Carolina" with his brother, Ephraim Bogardus. We seek more information regarding that potential <a href="#nc">trip</a>. In 1719, Ephraim was granted letters of administration on Cornelis's estate. During those years he was <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc17396.htm">active</a> in consolidating parts of Cornelis's estate.

<p>An <a href="http://archives.co.ulster.ny.us/taxassessment.htm">assessment roll</a> for Kingston dated 1716 showed an Ephraim Bogardus with property valued/assessed at &pound;6.

<p>In September 1720, Ephraim married Albany native <a href="../d/agdgarmo782.html">Agnietie De Garmo</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1734, eight children had been christened at the church where he was an occasional baptism sponsor at least thru February 1749 when he witnessed the baptism of a namesake boy.

<p>In <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc17396.htm">April 1725</a>, an Ephraim Bogardus (identified as a weaver) and "Johannis Van Vechten issued a bond to Barent Staats.

<p>Beyond the above, our ongoing sweeps of the community-based resources and those posted <a href="../../res/irs.html">online</a> have not produced additional material on the life of this subject. However, a number of same named individuals are at-risk in the region during the eighteenth century.

<p>Family-based but <a href="../../res/ts.html">un</a>documented resources have <a href="http://www.eancestry.org/getperson.php?personID=I10478&tree=nichols">fixed</a> his death date as October 12, 1770 in Coxsackie. Beyond diminishing returns on Albany native Ephraim Bogardus, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>

Although answers to the most useful life questions are <a href="../../res/guess.html">speculative</a>, most of them seem plausible. Also, he seeks to shed light on the trip to North Carolina mentioned in his father's will in 1711.  However, we seek definitive documentation on the "trip" and other active parts of his life.  </div>
