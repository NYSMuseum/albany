<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catherine Beasley</strong></a> is said to have been the daughter of sometime Albany residents <a href="hebeasley7286.html">Henry</a> and Mary Noble Beasley. If so, <a href="#perhaps">perhaps</a> she was born during the 1760s. She would have grown up in a leatherworker's home in the second ward. At some point, Henry Beasley seems to have left Albany. 

<p>In February 1788, she married newcomer <a href="../l/solockwood.html">Solomon Lockwood</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church in Albany where both partners were confirmed in September 1791. By that time, two children had been christened at St. Peter's.

<p>These Lockwoods made their home in <a href="../../census1790.html#solloc">W</a>atervliet and <a href="../../census1800.html#soloc">then</a> in Albany's first ward.

<p>By 1817, Solomon Lockwood was living in Ballston Spa where he died in 1822.

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Catherine Beasley Lockwood </p>
