<strong>Cornelia Bogardus</strong></a> was born in October 1719. She was the daughter of <a href="anbogardus6358.html">Anthony</a> and the young widow <a href="../k/jaknick1070.html">Jannetie Knickerbacker</a> Lansing  Williams. She grew up with a number of siblings in a woodworker's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In January 1744, she married Albany native <a href="../w/jowilliams6310.html">John Williams</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1757, four children had been christened in the Albany church where she was a pewholder and baptism sponsor.

<p>These Williamses were not particularly distinguished but mainline residents of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> for several decades. John was a barber who also kept boarders and performed services for the community.  

<P>John Williams probably died during the early 1780s. In May 1784, the <a href="../../res/realestate.html">deed</a> to a lot was to be awarded to his widow. In April, the mayor signed the deed for the lot her husband had held on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>. Widow Cornelia Bogardus Williams died in 1787 and was buried on July 7.</p>
