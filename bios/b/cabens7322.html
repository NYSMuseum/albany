      <P>According to later documents, <a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Bensen/Bensing</b></a>

        was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers 
        <a href="dibensing7319.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="../b/cabercx7334.html">Catharina 
        Bercx</a> Bensing. Her father was a carpenter from Groningan. He died 
        about 1659 and her mother re-married. 
      <p>In May 1663, she was one of five children named in the <a href="../../wills/willhahun.html">joint 
        will</a> filed by her mother and her new husband. At that time, she was 
        said to have been six years old. 
      <p>Her first husband was Reynier Schaets - who was killed in the attack 
        on Schenectady in February 1690. In April 1797, she married English-ancestry 
        newcomer <a href="jobroad5334.html">Jonathan Broadhurst</a> at the Albany
