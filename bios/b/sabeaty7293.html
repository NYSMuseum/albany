<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Beaty</strong></a> (Batty <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Betty) probably was born about 1740. Perhaps he was the 18 year-old whose name and <a href="#desc">description</a> appeared on a muster roll of provincial troops raised in Albany County in <a href="http://threerivershms.com/musterrea.htm">1761</a>. The next year, he was identified as a native of <a href="../irish.html">Ireland</a> on a subsequent roster of New York troops. We seek defining information on this subject's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

      <p>We expect to find militia/military <a href="../../guide/histres.html#military">information</a> 
        for this individual during the 1760s-80s. At this point, a number of similarly 
        named contemporaries are at-risk in the region. Several "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Samuel 
        Beatys</a>" served in the Patriot military. His name was not on the <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">basic 
        list</a> of Albany soldiers. 
      <p>He was in the city by the late 1770s although his name has not been encountered in the records of Albany's wartime <a href="../../coc.html">gov</a>erning bodies.

<p>His wife was Catharina Clensy<a href="../../res/sp.html">/</a>Clancy. In August 1778, their son (<a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part6.html">John Beety</a>) was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7293">1779</a>, Samuel's house and lot were considered on the assessment roll for the second ward. A <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7293">decade later</a>, his property was valued modestly near the end of the roster of the first ward.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA266&lpg=PA266&dq#v=onepage&q=betty&f=false">May 1786</a>, his petition for a small lot behind the fort  where he would build a house for himself and family was granted. He was to pay 16 shillings a year for his lot.

<p>In October 1789, the corporation denied his account because he had taken away a "large quantity of stone and brick from the fort." In April 1791, his petition for land was referred to committee.  

<p>In October 1788, the city records reported that his vote was not allowed because he had not obtained the "freedom of the city." His request for a cartman's license also was denied.


      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7293">1790</a>, the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">southern</a> 
        first ward household of "Samuel Batty" included nine members. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7293">1800</a>, 
        an adolescent boy, a man and a woman over 45 years of age were living 
        in the same location. 
      <p>Beginning in July 1799, his name appeared on lists of the city's <a href="../../poor.html#7293">permanent 
        poor</a> and was scheduled to receive 12 pounds annually. However, his 
        name has not been encountered subsequent to a payment authorized on August 
        4, 1801. 
      <p>With basic unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the life of Albany resident Samuel Beaty we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>

        <p>Perhaps this Albany resident was connected to the Betty family of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=%22samuel+beaty%22+albany&source=bl&ots=4SHg-AhTUM&sig=5KUTceedQmq0YFSG8NG-aAUqTC4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zayqVNqzDIq6yQTHhoKICQ&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20beaty%22%20albany&f=false">Dutchess 
          County</a> or of what became <a href="https://archive.org/details/historyofwashing00john">Washington

          during the second half of the eighteenth century. They probably were 
          of <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> origin.
