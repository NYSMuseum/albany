<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Maria Bries</strong></a> was born in August 1693. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="anbries6333.html">Antony</a> and <a href="../r/caryckman1911.html">Catharina Ryckman</a> Bries. Her father died in 1704. Two years earlier, she had been <a href="../../wills/willanbries6333.html">named</a> among the heirs to his estate.

<p>In July 1721, Maria married <a href="../vd/covdyck822.html">Cornelis Van Dyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1731, the marriage had produced six children - all of whom were christened in Albany.

<p>These Van Dycks set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> and were Albany mainstays for several decades.
 
<p>Cornelis Van Dyck filed a will in March 1747. It left his estate to Maria and then to their <a href="../vd/hvdyck832.html">son</a>. Cornelis died two months later. Maria Bries Van Dyck lived another decade. She died in 1756 and was buried from the Albany church on April 8.
