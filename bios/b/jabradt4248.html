<p>She was past her twenty-seventh birthday when she married Albany native <a href="../../bios/y/abjyates4440.html">Abraham J. Yates</a> in August 1761. Between 1763 and 1774, five of her children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member and pewholder.</p>


<p>Wife of an Albany baker and city official, Jannetie raised her family in a modest home 
on one of Albany's <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">back streets</a>.</p>


<p>Abraham J. Yates filed his will in December 1794. It named his "beloved wife" as the beneficiary of all his estate during her widowhood. However, Jannetie Bradt Yates died in November 1804. Her husband was buried next to her three months later.</p>
