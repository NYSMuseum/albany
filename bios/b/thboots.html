<P>Subsequent resources tell us that one-time Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Boots</strong></a> probably  was born within a few years of 1750. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>An adult during the <a href="../../or/or.html">era</a> of the American Revolution, we expect to find records relating to his wartime activities.

<p>It appears that this individual was married. However, no information has been recovered from the extant records of early Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7377">1800</a>, the census for the second ward identified him as the head of a household with four young men a young woman, and an aging couple. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, he was identified as the owner of a house and lot, another <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/6771/41761_328301-00272?pid=344214&backurl=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc%3DCFV21%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource%26usePUBJs%3Dtrue%26gss%3Dangs-g%26new%3D1%26rank%3D1%26msT%3D1%26gsfn%3Dthomas%26gsfn_x%3D0%26gsln%3Dboots%26gsln_x%3D0%26msypn__ftp%3DAlbany,%2520Albany,%2520New%2520York,%2520USA%26msypn%3D10034%26msypn_PInfo%3D8-%257C0%257C1652393%257C0%257C2%257C0%257C35%257C0%257C128%257C10034%257C0%257C0%257C%26cp%3D0%26catbucket%3Drstp%26MSAV%3D0%26MSV%3D0%26pcat%3DROOT_CATEGORY%26h%3D344214%26recoff%3D7%25208%26dbid%3D6771%26indiv%3D1%26ml_rpos%3D1&treeid=&personid=&hintid=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=CFV21&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true#?imageId=41761_328301-00272">time</a> as a "house and shop", and <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/6771/41761_328301-00422/349235?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fgst%3d-6&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnSearchResults">then</a> (in 1801) as a half lot probably all on or near <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a> in the second ward.

<p>Thomas Boots was buried from the Dutch church in late April 1803. Letters of administration were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">issued</a> on his estate on May 14, 1803. At that time, Boots was <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/8800/005114125_00121?pid=918151&backurl=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc%3DCFV25%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource%26usePUBJs%3Dtrue%26gss%3Dangs-g%26new%3D1%26rank%3D1%26msT%3D1%26gsfn%3Dthomas%26gsfn_x%3D0%26gsln%3Dboots%26gsln_x%3D0%26msypn__ftp%3DAlbany,%2520Albany,%2520New%2520York,%2520USA%26msypn%3D10034%26msypn_PInfo%3D8-%257C0%257C1652393%257C0%257C2%257C0%257C35%257C0%257C128%257C10034%257C0%257C0%257C%26cp%3D0%26catbucket%3Drstp%26MSAV%3D0%26MSV%3D0%26pcat%3DROOT_CATEGORY%26h%3D918151%26dbid%3D8800%26indiv%3D1%26ml_rpos%3D6&treeid=&personid=&hintid=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=CFV25&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true">identified</a> as deceased and formerly a "nailor of the city of Albany." His principal creditor was Albany resident George Shepherd.

<p>Afterwards, a <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=172710142&amp;ref=acom">stone</a> erected by Elizabeth Boots (probably his widow or daughter) marked the grave of forty-eight-year-old Thomas Boots and was among those later "found" in the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> Ebenezer plot at the <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.
<p>Missing important information and past diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany resident Thomas Boots.</p>
