      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William "Billy" Bromley</strong></a> was 
        born in February 1722 and christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. He was the son of bellman <a href="jobromley5957.html">John</a> 
        and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_b0TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&dq=William,+John+Sara+Bromly&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjB7vn5967LAhWFXR4KHUnyC40Q6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&q=William%2C%20John%20Sara%20Bromly&f=false">Sara</a> (perhaps <a href="../v/viele.html">Viele</a>) Bromley. 
      <p>In June 1742, he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> <a href="leboom.html">Lena 
        Boom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1757, 
        the marriage had produced seven children who were christened in Albany 
        <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, these Bromleys witnessed 
        baptisms and received burial services at the Dutch church. 
      <p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?lpg=PA100&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+9&pg=PA100&id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&ots=ssp_5u99Tk#v=onepage&q=drury&f=false">August 
        1742</a> and a year later in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?lpg=PA100&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+9&pg=PA100&id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&ots=ssp_5u99Tk#v=snippet&q=bromley&f=false">1743</a>, 
        he had entered into an agreement with the Albany city <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a> 
        to live in the house of Samuel Drury and to maintain and repair it. That 
        property was located on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> 
        and the rent was set at ten shillings a year. However, the rent was to 
        be returned to him so that he could fix the roof. 
      <p>In 1766 and 1767, his name appeared on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a> for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first</a> and then second 
        ward. In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bZAbAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA853&lpg=PA853&dq=%22bromley%22&source=bl&ots=nE-9GxMjSo&sig=VuI_v4jJ7BGuCdFbghy8eJ4AMFQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQ6sucoqTKAhVLNj4KHYy1AiEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22bromley%22&f=true">1767</a>, 
        he was identified as an enlisted man in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. 
      <p>William Bromley appears to have been a marginal Albany resident. His 
        name appeared infrequently in the mainstream <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based</a> 
        record. Perhaps he died sometime after 1767. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>, his name no longer 
        appeared on the tax rolls. However, those of his sons <a href="sabromley5963.html">Samuel</a> 
        and Simon, were accorded modest assessments. 
      <p>William Bromley's widow was identified on an Albany "<a href="../../poor.html">poor</a> 
        list" in 1799.</p>
