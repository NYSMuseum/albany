<P><a href="#sources"><b>Dirck Barentse Bradt</b></a> was born during the 1660s. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="baalbradt4182.html">Barent</a> and <a href="../d/susdircks4368.html">Susanna Dircks</a> Bradt. He grew up in Albany - learning the features of trading, sawing, and farming from his father who controlled substantial resources in the Albany area. Three <a href="bradt.html#bbs">brothers</a> further established the family in the greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany area</a>. </p>


<p>In September 1686, he married <a href="../e/anegberts4499.html">Anna Egberts</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced at least six children - four of whom were baptized in the Albany Dutch church where the parents were members, pewholders, and frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>Dirck Barentse was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#163">mainstay</a> whose home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> near the <a href="../../loc/northend.html"> North gate</a> was assesssed as substantial property on community tax rolls. He owned additional real estate in Albany and beyond. </p>

<p>He was well-represented on the rolls of community organizations including the Dutch church, <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>, and as a contractor of the city. He also served as firemaster, assessor, and assistant <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> for the third ward. Like his father, he was involved in city finances. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4344">1699</a>, he signed a petition pledging loyalty to the King of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4344">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of qualified voters.</p>

<p>Dirck Barentse Bradt died in June 1735.</p>
