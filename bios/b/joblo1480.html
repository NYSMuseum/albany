<strong>Jan (Johannes) Maase</strong></a> probably was born during the 1690s. He probably was a member of the Bloomendal family but mostly was known as "Jan" or "Johannes Maase." He was a member of an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#1480">militia company</a> in 1715. He may have been among those <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> in July 1723. He was the brother of Albany resident <a href="coblo1464.html">Cornelis Maase</a>.

<p>In September 1718, he married <a href="../f/refonda.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1728, the marriage had produced six children who were christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor. His wife may have died following the birth of their last child. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1480">1720</a>, his name first appeared on Albany rolls when he was identified as a freeholder in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He was a <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1480">mainline</a> Albany resident for the next half century. This Maase family lived on the east corner of of Columbia and Pearl Streets. Jan Maase was a <a href="../../census1756.html#296">brazier</a> with holdings of moderate value. He owned slaves and either lived with or next to his brother - who also was a <a href="../../census1756.html#297">brass worker.</a>. Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1714">1714</a> and as late as <a href="../../org/cc.html#1755">1755</a>, he served the community at various times as constable and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. 

<p>In 1761, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willcoblo1464.html">will</a> of his brother. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>, his third ward property was valued substantially for a tradesman. Jan Maase Bloomendal may have lived into the 1770s.</p>
