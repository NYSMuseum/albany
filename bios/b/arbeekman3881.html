<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ariaantie Beekman</b></a> was born in August 1714. She was the first child born to Albany residents <a href="jobeekman3859.html">Johannes Jr.</a> and Hester Wendell Beekman. She was provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3859.html">will</a> filed by her father in July 1731.</p>


<p>In August 1740, Ariaantie married <a href="../l/gelansing3703.html">Gerrit Is. Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Four children were christened in Albany between 1740 and 1748 when Gerrit I. Lansing died.</p>

<p>Ariaantie Beekman Lansing did not re-marry and took over as the head of her <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household. Perhaps, her <a href="../../census1756.html#170">home</a> was configured on the census of Albany households taken in 1756. Her modest home was valued on city assessments - usually with her sons <a href="../l/islansing3473.html">Isaac</a> or Gerrit also named as owners. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3881" title="Link to Albany Assessment roll for 1788">1788</a>, her home had four boarders. In <a href="../../census1790.html#3881">1790</a>, her household included an adult male, two boys, four females, and a slave.</p>

<p>Although her pew rent was paid until 1797, her name otherwise dropped from city rolls after 1790.</p>
