      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Samuel Bromley</strong></a> was born in October 
        1753. He was a younger son of Albany residents <a href="wmbromley5965.html">William</a> 
        and <a href="leboom.html">Lena Boom</a> <a href="../../res/sp.html">Br</a>omley. 
        He shared the first ward home of a marginal Albany native along with a 
        number of older siblings who would become city residents. 
      <p>In February 1776, Samuel married <a href="../s/maspoor6530.html">Maria 
        Spoor</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. It 
        appears that the marriage was long lasting but perhaps childless. Maria 
        was dead by July 1826, when Samuel married Mrs. Elizabeth Brown. A <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> 
        noted that both partners were then seventy-three years old. 
      <p>Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5963">1779</a>, his 
        lots in the western part of the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> 
        were valued on Albany assessment rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5963">1788</a>, 
        his real and personal property was valued at a total of ten pounds. On 
        a number of occasions, he seems to have bought and sold <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">lots</a> 
        located along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Fox Creek</a>, in the 
        western part of Albany, and <a href="../..//guide/histres.html#rpr">larger 
        tracts</a> in Guilderland. 
      <p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1790.html#5963">1790</a>, his household 
        was configured on the second ward census. Over the next three decades, 
        his household appeared on the Albany <a href="../../census1800.html#5963">census</a>. 
        As many as nine people of varying ages lived in his house. However, it 
        appears that Samuel and Maria christened no children in the Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
        By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, his household consisted 
        only of an aged couple and one servant. 
      <p>Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a> (but 
        perhaps somewhat earlier), community-based records identified him as an 
        <a href="../../loc/public.html">innkeeper</a> - mostly located on Lion 
        Street/Washington Avenue near the beginning of the main <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a> 
        to Schenectady. 
      <p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22rensselaer+westerlo%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=bromlee&f=false">1813</a>, 
        the first city directory listed the home of "Samuel Bromley" at 140 Lion 
        Street. Subsequent <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> identified 
        him as an innkeeper with an address roughly at 130-40 <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion</a> 
        (Washington) Street. A developer's <a href="../../im/im1794.html">map</a> 
        dated 1794 shows his house and property on the southwestern corner of 
        Lion and Dove Streets. He was last listed in the directory in 1822 at 
        140 Washington. 
      <p>In September 1824, a State Supreme Court awarded Samuel Bromley a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SMQCiOh-RXgC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22samuel+bromley%22+albany&source=bl&ots=lZWvXGLfCq&sig=tgs2PVECE6zVFASaWjGkXpl5SbY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0sfmd8P7JAhXJRiYKHWhkCqgQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q=samuel%20bromley&f=false">judgment</a> 
        of $600 from a loan to Albany potter <a href="../c/pacushman.html">Paul 
        Cushman</a>. 
      <p><a href="../qqqq.html#one">A</a> Samuel Bromley was convicted of manslaughter 
        in Albany County in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XP9OXSEvvkYC&pg=PA304&lpg=PA304&dq=%22samuel+bromley%22+albany&source=bl&ots=q-Y0eBC0SF&sig=YmwIjSrR8wjMWpL3cxVvzPtYf30&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0sfmd8P7JAhXJRiYKHWhkCqgQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20bromley%22%20albany&f=false">1825</a> 
        and sentenced to ten years in prison. We <a href="../../res/guess.html">guess</a> 
        (but certainly are not certain) that the criminal probably was not this 
        subject. 
      <p>A lifelong resident and Albany mainliner, innkeeper Samuel Bromley was 
        dead by June 28, 1828 when his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a>.</p>
