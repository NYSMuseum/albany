<strong>Adrian (Adrianus) Bancker</strong></a> was born in October 1703. He was the son in the large family of <a href="ebancker6454.html">Evert</a> and <a href="../a/elabeel118.html">Elizabeth Abeel</a> Bancker. He grew up in a prominent businessman's homes in Albany and Manhattan.

<p>In 1718, he was apprenticed to a well-known New York City silversmith. He established himself in that <a href="../../trades/silver.html">trade</a> in New York.

<p>In January 1729, he married Elizabeth Van Taerling in New York. They may have had nine children - none of whom became Albany esidents.

<p>In April 1731, he was admitted to the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22william+bancker%22&ots=W3GO6m-IDH&jtp=117">freemanship</a> of New York City and was called a "goldsmith." At the same time, Adrian Bancker is conspicuously absent from the Albany community <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a>.
 

<p>In 1734, he was <a href="../../wills/willebancker6454.html">named</a> co-executor and an heir of his father's estate.

<p>He was a New York City alderman during  the 1730s and 40s and Commissioner of Fortifications in New York in 1755 and 1756.


<p>Adrian Bancker is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/112679.htm">said</a> to have died in Albany in August 1772.</p>
