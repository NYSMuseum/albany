<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Burgiss</b></a> was a one-time British soldier who settled in Albany. New York <a href="../../sources.html#sh">military records</a> reveal that in March 1757 he was a bombradier in a detachment of the Royal Regiment of Artillery.</p>

<p>In 1767, he was identified as the owner of a modest house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Shortly thereafter, his wife and family began to be listed among the members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> English church. His family had four members in 1768.</p>

<p>In 1770, he was appointed to the Albany night watch. The next year, his account was paid by the city government. In 1779, his house in the first ward was listed on city assessment rolls. He was granted a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany County militia.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7483">1790</a>, his second ward household was enumerated on the first federal census. In 1797, he was included on a juror's list as a cartman living in the second ward.</p>

<p>John Burgiss died after 1797. His <a href="caburgiss2048.html">daughter</a> may have married schoolteacher and businessman <a href="../m/geomcelcheran2110.html">George Mc Elcheran</a>!</p>
