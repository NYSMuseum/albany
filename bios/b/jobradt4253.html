<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Barentse Bradt</b></a> was born during the 1660s. He was the American-born son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="baalbradt4182.html">Barent Albertse</a> and <a href="../d/susdircks4368.html">Susanna Dircks</a> Bradt.</p>

<p>Growing up in a large and broadly constituted early Albany <a href="bradt.html">family</a>, he was a <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a>. As a young man, business led him to opportunities beyond the bounds of his father's Albany home. Consequently, he may not have married until he was in his thirties. His bride was a younger <a href="../k/maketel4646.html">Maria Ketelhuyn</a> - the mother of their nine children who, by 1709, were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>As early as 1687, he was identified as an Albany merchant. In 1694, he was appointed constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> - where Barent Bradt had his house. Following his marriage, Johannes set up his own home on the corner of Market Street and Maiden Lane. He soon he became an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#062">mainstay</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4253">1699</a>, he joined with his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a> valued his third ward home comparably to those of other business people.</p>

<p>He was known as "Captain Bradt" probably by virtue of his <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> connection. He was able to secure farmland beyond Albany - in the upper Hudson Valley and at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. Even before the coming of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> in 1713, he sought to develop those external holdings.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, those ambitions led to disaster as the frontier proved unsafe for him and his family. Although <a href="../../res/ts.html">t</a>raditional sources range from less than <a href="http://bobmurg.home.att.net/massacre_at_schaghticoke.htm">credible</a> to <a href="http://www.mechanicville.com/history/articles/who_killed_capt%20bratt.htm">conflicting</a>, there is some agreement that Johannes Barentse Bradt was killed by Indians following an incident at Schaghticoke on October 20, 1711. Several family members were killed and Bradt's son and wife were captured and taken to Canada.</p>
