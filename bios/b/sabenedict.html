<P>According to family-based/<a href="../../res/ts.html">traditional</a> resources and particularly to a <a href="#mem">mem</a>orial obituary, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sally Benedict</strong></a> (more formally Sarah Marie) was born in August 1774. She was the daughter of Reverend Joel and Sarah Marie Benedict of Norwich, Connecticut. 

<p>In July 1796, Sarah Marie married <a href="../n/elnott.html">Eliphalet Nott</a> - who had studied theology with her father. Their daughter was christened at the Albany Presbyterian church in December 1799. A son was born in 1801. 

<p>After initially serving as teacher and pastor in Cherry Valley, New York, the couple <a href="../../census1800.html#elno">settled</a> in Albany where Nott was ordained in 1798 and then installed at the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. Sally assumed roles of mother and wife of a prominent and rising cleric in an evolving community in the process of being transformed by <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> - particularly those who, like the Notts, came from <a  href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a>. 

<p>Her marriage, however, would not be a long one as Sally Benedict Nott died in 1804. The inscription on her stone <a href="https://books.google.com/books?dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7&jtp=237&id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q=sally%20nott&f=false">read</a>: "Sally Nott, consort of Eliphalet Nott, Minister of the Presbyterian Church, Albany, and daughter of Rev. Joel Benedict, died 9 March, 1804, aged 29 years 6 mo." Nott remarried in 1807 and again in 1841.

<p>About the time of Sally's passing, Eliphalet Nott removed to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady where he became president of Union College - a revered status he retained until his death in 1866.</p>

<p><a name=mem></a>An extraordinary discourse on her life and character appeared as an <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lBldAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=Appendix">appendix</a> (on page 37) to the published version of a public discourse presented by her husband in Albany at the time of her death. This eyewitness account (signed by the author simple as "a friend") one has few equals as a qualitative resource among the people of colonial Albany. The final (and detailed) discussion of her decline and death is particularly fascinating.</div>
