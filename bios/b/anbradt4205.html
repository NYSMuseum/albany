<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anthony B. Bradt</strong></a> was born in November 1731. He was the son of <a href="bebradt4213.html">Benjamin</a> and <a href="../r/magryckman1976.html">Magdalena Ryckman</a> Bradt. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of a long-lived tradesman and city retainer. He was known as "Anthony B." to distinguish him from at least two other city-based and historically visible  contemporaries. Thus, this sketch is confined to materials that pertain to <a href="../../res/sp.html">An</a>thony B. Bradt. 

<p>At this point, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">suspect</a> that this only son does <a href="#marr">not</a> appear to have married and to have lived in the house of his father for most of his adult life.


<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4213">after</a>wards, his personal property was valued under his father's roof on city assessment rolls.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=%22anthony+b+bratt%22&source=bl&ots=wxhEbWubgv&sig=V7qpq05Rgxc_B9TD3xs58igXxUs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dFkEUJy2MuS46gGkwqHwBg&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22anthony%20b%20bratt%22&f=false">appointed</a> fireman. In 1776, he was paid by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> for "riding" powder. In 1777, he was among those in the third ward who voted in the municipal election. 

<p>In his fifties at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, in October 1779 he was identified as a city resident and as a member of Capt. <a href="../p/joprice6447.html">Price</a>'s militia company who would be <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YYjPr7Ht7d8C&pg=PA385&lpg=PA385&dq=%22anthony+b+bradt%22&source=bl&ots=k5BwiWjpmD&sig=G34Ciw7OrKyJGxy7ERBie-ZPAco&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GjEEUO_FHMal6wGQhuiFBw&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22anthony%20b%20bradt%22&f=false">exempt</a> from active military service as long as he was employed by the public storekeeper. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4205">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>Unlike an "Anthony" and a "Theunis Bradt," this individual seems to have been unaccounted for on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. 
 
<p>However, in December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fGFGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA711&lpg=PA711&dq=%22anthony+b+bradt%22&source=bl&ots=fBJP8b1MVD&sig=EFr8xkhs45i5x3OLuZNrJJ7Kfoo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GjEEUO_FHMal6wGQhuiFBw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA">1794</a>, a legal action in Albany referenced Anthony B. Bradt's witnessing a transaction in 1785 and ALSO that he was present in 1794 although someone else signed for him (meaning?).  

<p>Anthony B. Bradt presumably died sometime thereafter. </p>

<p><a name=marr></a>However, a <a href="http://www.threerivershms.com/marriageV.htm#532">marriage license</a> was granted to Anthony B. Bradt and Mary Van Deursen in January 1764. <a href="../../sources.html#pfs"><i>PFS</i></a> notes they were married in February. A son named Egbert was christened by them in 1765. The name "Egbert gives" us pause with Anthony B.'s father alive and providing a home for the son at that time. Albany church records do not seem to follow with expected information. Perhaps Van Deursen went a different way as she received a license to marry someone else six months later.
