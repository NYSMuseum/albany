<P><a href="#sources"><b>Daniel B. Bradt</b></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="baalbradt4182.html">Barent Albertse</a> and <a href="../d/susdircks4368.html">Susanna Dircks</a> Bradt. He grew up on the family's <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#nrmskl">Normanskill</a> farm and at his father's house in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany. </p>


<p>In April 1697, he married <a href="../l/ellansing3232.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1713, seven children were baptized there where he was a member and frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>This Daniel Bradt sought to participate in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. However, he was fined several times during the 1690s for selling rum to the Indians at Kinderhook and elsewhere away from Albany. After his marriage, he <a href="../../census1697.html#127">settled</a> his family in a house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4340">1699<a/>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. Over the next decade, his holdings were configured on Albany assessment <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4340">rolls</a>. In 1709, he was part owner of a house in the first ward as well.</p>

<p>By that time, he had gained some acceptance in his community - serving as a juror, contractor, and was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a> in the first ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1712">1712</a> and 1713.</p>

<p>In 1708, he began to express interest in obtaining land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. In October 1726, a payment of eight shillings was authorized by the city for Elizabeth, the widow of Daniel Bradt</p>
