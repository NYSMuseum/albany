      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rutger Bleecker</strong></a> was born in 
        July 1745. He was the eldest son of <a href="jorbleecker201.html">John 
        R.</a> and <a href="../s/elstaats4566.html">Elizabeth Staats</a> Bleecker. 
        He grew up in the <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        home of a prominent merchant and surveyor. 
      <p>In January 1756, he was one of two Rutger Bleeckers named in the <a href="../../wills/willrjbleecker227.html">will</a> 
        of his wealthy and aged namesake grandfather. 
      <p>Beginning in 1766, his house and property were valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. Although only twenty-one, he was taxed comparable to that of 
        Albany's established businessmen. In 1768, he held a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning 
        pit</a> on the south side of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a> and other lots in the city as well. Later, his accounts were 
        paid from the city treasury. 
      <p>In October 1768, he married Kingston native <a href="../e/caelmendorf.html">Catherine 
        Elmendorf</a>. By 1788, as many as five children had been christened at 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents 
        were members. Two others were baptized in Kingston and Schenectady. The 
        last daughter was born in Albany on January 16, 1788 - <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part7.html">after</a> 
        the death of her father. 
      <p>At the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, 
        he was selected to represent the second ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a>. He contributed to the American cause, served as 
        <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in 1776, and signed a 
        number of <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">oaths</a> and petitions in support 
        of the Revolutionary cause. However, in July 1778, he was one of three 
        merchants summoned separately by the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">commissioners</a> 
        and <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting01paltrich#page/188/mode/2up">compelled</a> 
        to sign the oath of allegiance to New York State. 
      <p>In March 1784, he was identified as an Albany merchant when he witnessed 
        the <a href="../../wills/willabvplanck1102.html">will</a> of Abraham Verplanck. 

<p>In September 1787, Rutger Bleecker filed a <a href="../../wills/willrubleecker228.html">will</A>. It named his wife as principal heir and referenced but did not name their children. His <a href="barbleecker150.html">brother</a> and <a href="../e/peelmen.html">brother-in-law</a> also joined Catherine as co-executors. He died in October and was buried from his church. He had lived but forty-two years and was survived by both his parents. His widow was listed on the second ward assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#228">1788</a> and lived on in their Pearl Street home for more than two decades. </p>

        <dd>He may have been the Rutger Bleecker for whom the town of <a href="http://fulton.nygenweb.net/history/frenchgaz.htm">Bleecker</a> 
          was named. We <a href="../../inprog.html">believe</a> that he also held
