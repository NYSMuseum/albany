<strong>Albertus Bloomendal</strong></a> was born in December 1735. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jablo1479.html">Jacob Maase</a> and <a href="../g/sagardinier.html">Sara Gardinier</a> Bloomendal. He had lost both of his parents by the time he was twenty years old. 

<p>In May 1756, he married <a href="../o/maost1055.html">Maria Ostrander</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She died after giving birth to a daughter in October of that year. In August 1763, he married <a href="../h/anharsen8345.html">Anna Harsen</a>. By 1785, their ten children had been christened at the Albany church.

<p>His adult life seems to have been connected closely to that of his brother, <a href="mablo1506.html">Maas Bloomendal, Jr.</a>. In 1761, they were bequeathed the house and lot where they then were living in the <a href="../../wills/willcoblo1464.html">will</a> of their uncle.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his name began appearing on city assessment rolls describing his modest holdings in the second and then first <a href="../../wards.html">wards</a>. By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1455">1788</a>, the brothers had separated their housholds with Albertus <a href="../../census1790.html#1455">living</a> on <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html#mid">upper</a> State Street.

<p>Like many members of his family, he was a brazier but was best known as the city watchman - first belonging to the "night watch" in 1770. Unlike his brother, his name was not associated with the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">arms</a> of the Revolutionary movement except that he did receive a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1485">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>During the 1780s and 90s, his name appeared on <a href="../../corporation.html#retainers">city rolls</a> as a watchman, fireman, and as a freeholder living in the first ward. In <a href="../../census1800.html#1455">1800</a>, his household still included three children.   


<p>Albertus Bloomendal died in July 1817. He was in his eighty-second year. His will passed probate later in July. </p>
