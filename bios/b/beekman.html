<P>Spelled and referenced <a href="../../res/sp.html">variously</a>, the Beekmans were a prolific <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> era family that would thrive in colonial New York and Beyond. The eighteenth century Beekmans were particularly prominent in commerce and trade. They also were substantial <a href="../../res/realestate.html">landholders</a> in many parts of New York.  The Albany history of the <a href="#sources"><b>Beekman family</b></a> probably begins with the children of the <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="../qqqq.html#one">known as</a> Marte and Susanna Beekman.

<p>Their son <a href="jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Martense Beekman</a> settled in during the last quarter of the seventeenth century. His family prospered in its Albany setting while other branches became prominent in New York, 
        Schenectady, and notably in the development of farming in the mid and 
        lower Hudson Valley. Daughter <a href="mabeekman3923.html">"Metie"</a> 
        Vanderhoeven raised her family in Albany but left following the death 
        of her husband in 1689. </p>
      <p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, Albany had five Beekman-named 
        households - including that of alderman <a href="jobeekman3861.html">Johannes 
        J. Beekman</a>.
		
<p>Son <a href="jabeekman3890.html">of</a> a blacksmith, merchant/officeholder, <a href="jojabeekman3866.html">John Ja. Beekman</a> was appointed mayor of Albany in 1783. </p>

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, four Beekman households were noted in the city (including that of butcher/businessman <a href="chbeekman3900.html">Christopher Beeckman</a> - <font size=-1>probably a different family</font size>) with two more in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>. A <a href="../../census1800.html">decade later</a>, four Beeckman-named households were configured on the city census. In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22beeckman%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=beeckman&f=false">1813</a>, the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> listed but two "Beeckman" addresses. By 1820, the name no longer appeared in the city directory.
 
 

      <p>Today, the Beekman name is recalled by <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/clinton/towns/beekmantown.html">place 
        names</a> in the Hudson and Champlain Valleys. The <a href="http://beekmandelamaterinn.com/history.htm">Beekman 
        Arms</a> in Rhinebeck is a legendary stopping place. Beekman Street in 
        Albany is named for Mayor Johannes James Beekman.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> We have adopted "Beekman" as the "standard" <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelling</a> of a name that appears often in a variety of forms. Our work on the Beekman family is based on <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The standard printed work on the family, <i>Distinguished families in America, descended from Wilhelmus Beekman and Jan Thomasse Van Dyke</i> by William B.
