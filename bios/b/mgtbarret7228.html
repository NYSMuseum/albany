<P><a href="#sources"><b>Margaret Barret</b></a> probably was born in March 1719. If so, she was the daughter of Thomas and Barentje Spoor Barret  and grew up on the <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> of Albany in a neighborhood first populated by former <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison soldiers</a>.</p>


<p>She married innkeeper <a href="../c/jochristie7613.html">John Christie</a> in February 1760 at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. At that <a href="#time">time</a> she was identified as a "spinster." The marriage probably produced no children.</p>

<p>"Captain" Christy's inn was located at "the Sandbergh" along the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a> that lead from Albany to Schenectady.</p>

<p>Margaret Barret Christie may have been still alive and listed in the second ward <a href="../../census1790.html#7613">household</a> of John Christie on the census of 1790.</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Margaret Barret Christie (many spellings of both surnames) is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 7228. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. This exposition is cautious as we presently lack family-based information!</p>

<a name=time>Dutch church records for May 6, 1759, note "Ma[rried] by order of the Officer: John Hilton of the Inniskilling Regt., and Margaret Barret, both at present at Albany." Could this be the same Margaret?</p>
