<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Pitt Beers</strong></a> was born in April 1766. He was the son of Samuel and widow Sarah Huntington Wetmore Beers of Stratford, Connecticut. He was a middle child in a combined <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> family. 

<p>He graduated from Yale in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RGkNAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=%22william+pitt+beers%22&source=bl&ots=st-rB47swO&sig=hVCScbs-hqF3QbO_4pjtxJ24Amc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Erz8U7nqHMiuogSE_YDIAw&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=%22william%20pitt%20beers%22&f=false">1785</a> and then studied for the law. Perhaps the most interesting (and personal) <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=L7gTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=%22william+pitt+beers%22&source=bl&ots=DzFI_6KNes&sig=MDFxj-Sm_xQC4AHKlCGqB8_QlII&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1GH7U7DVDubksAS72IGoCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=%22william%20pitt%20beers%22&f=false">biographical sketch</a> of him comes from his friend, Rev. Timothy Dwight, who stayed with Beers while he was in Albany.

<p>In October 1793, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nY8cJB47MzEC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22william+pitt+beers%22&source=bl&ots=AtJI5kQ5Xa&sig=yPHhgfr0hTeCmH-uPFUVdWlM370&hl=en&sa=X&ei=L137U7SGBovksAThxoGACQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22william%20pitt%20beers%22&f=false">married</a> Ann Sturgis, the daughter of a Fairfield jurist. By 1797, the marriage produced at least four children.


<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, Beers was living in Albany where his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house and holdings were valued on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7296">1800</a>, the city census noted the household of "William P. Beers" with Beers and his wife, three young boys, and a slave in the same location.

<p>In January 1800, he delivered what later was <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/an-oration-on-the-death-of-general-washington-pronounced-before-the-citizens-of-albany-on-thursday-january-9th-1800-by-william-p-beers-esquire-william-pitt-beers/1029494721?ean=9781170878545">published</a> as <i>An Oration, On The Death Of General Washington; Pronounced Before The Citizens Of Albany, On Thursday, January 9th, 1800. By William P. Beers, Esquire</i>.

<p>Beers was <a href="http://archives.nypl.org/controlaccess/146194?term=Beers, William Pitt, 1766-1810">known</a> <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x8q_uqY9360C&pg=PA461&lpg=PA461&dq=%22william+p+beers%22+albany&source=bl&ots=FQciT1WQSR&sig=3VP4W_xy_Kn0Sncw31zYC5x2rck&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tL38U5rRKJC2ogToyYK4Bg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22william%20p%20beers%22%20albany&f=false">widely</a> as an <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a> and was politically active. In April <a href="../znotes/tvwgrahamnotes.html">1805</a>, he was at a meeting of Albany Federalists to nominate candidates for office. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#state">1808</a>, he was among the worthies on <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> invited to the funeral of Henry J. Bleecker

<p>In 1810, he was identified as a trustee of the first <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a>.

<p>A magazine feature published in 1857 (and widely reprinted), described "Albany Fifty Years Ago" and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=%22william+pitt+beers%22&source=bl&ots=0UjgwqLrCp&sig=DwRc9W89T4VQ4C-ucgyfHRbWXzY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rDkYVM7_INaAsQSE8oLwDw&ved=0CEMQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22william%20pitt%20beers%22&f=false">noted</a> the home of William Pitt Beers located next to the landmark Lydius House on the <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">corner</a> of State and Pearl. 

<p>In February 1810, Beers was appointed city and county clerk. However, he soon became ill and his friend printer <a href="../w/crwebster6841.html">Charles R. Webster</a> carried out the duties of the office as his deputy - <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq=%22william+pitt+beers+lawyer%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=beers&f=false">paying</a> the clerk's stipend to Beers's wife until the former clerk <a href="../c/chcooper462.html">Charles D. Cooper</a> was re-appointed the following March.

<p>The Albany newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#v=onepage&q=beers+clerk&f=false">noted</a> the death of William Pitt Beers on September 13, 1810 and that he was the "clerk of the city and county of Albany." He was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=48824054">interred</a> in a tomb in "Ye old burying ground" in Fairfield, Connecticut. He had lived only forty-four years.</p>
