<strong>Barent Bleecker</strong></a> was born in June 1760. He was a younger son (the fourth named "Barent") of <a href="jorbleecker201.html">John R.</a> and <a href="../s/elstaats4566.html">Elizabeth Staats</a> Bleecker. He grew up in a large family on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in the home of a former sheriff, surveyor,  regional landholder, and patriot leader.

<p>He came of age during the era of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>. At this point, we <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on his wartime activities. However, afterward, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#150">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In December 1787, Barent married <a href="../l/salansing3671.html">Sara Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. What seems to have been their only child was born in 1793. Like most of his kin, Barent was a member and supporter of the Albany church.

<p>After starting married life in the home of his widowed <a href="../w/jawaters465.html">mother-in-law</a>, he soon became a prominent businessman and community leader who made his <a href="../../census1790.html#150">home</a> on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">North Market Street</a>. He also owned a store on the riverfront, stables, storehouses, houses, and lots in a number of locations around the city.

<p>In September 1787, he was named co-executor of the estate of his older <a href="rubleecker228.html">brother</a>. In March 1792, he was <a href="../../wills/willjorbleecker201.html">identified</a> as one of the heirs to the extensive estate of his father.

<p>At the same time, he owned extensive <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> in <a href="#upstate">upstate</a> New York. The town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleecker,_New_York">Bleecker</a> in Fulton County, which grew from a tract he purchased in 1793, is named for him. He also was a land agent for a number of owners.

<p>He was an <a href="http://www.history.rochester.edu/canal/bib/whitford/1906/Chap01.html">advocate</a> and supporter of the building of canals in upstate New York. In this initiative, he was an <a href="http://www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/schuylerp.pdf">associate</a> of General <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> and  was treasurer of the "Western Inland Lock Navigation Company."

<p>In <a href="http://www.argosybooks.com/-autographs/-ABs/Albany_Schenectady.html">1805</a>, he was treasurer of the "Albany & Schenectady Turnpike Company."

<p><a href="../../census1800.html#150">Census</a> records show that he was an active slave owner - with six slaves living in his house in 1810. In 1801, he <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc10431.htm">sold</a> his negro "Store" to his uncle. 
<p>Barent Bleecker died in June 1840. He had lived eighty years. In September, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on his estate.</p>
