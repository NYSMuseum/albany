<strong>Goldsbrow Banyar, Jr.</strong></a> was born during the 1760s or '70s. He was the son of <a href="gbanyar7200.html">Goldsbrow Banyar</a> and his wife, the widow Elizabeth Mortier Appy of New York City. His father was a prominent royal official who withdrew to the seclusion and safety of Dutchess County at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. However, the elder Banyar was not among those condemned and banished by his <a href="../../friends.html">friends</a>, the former revolutionaries.

<p>In September 1786, Goldsbrow Jr. was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA277,M1">named</a> as one of three granchildren who were heirs to the estate of his Manhattan-based, widowed grandmother. 

<p>During the early 1790s, his father moved their family from Rhinebeck to Albany where the Banyars took up residence in a prominent house located at 62 <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">North Pearl Street</a>. Goldsbrow Jr. was confirmed in  <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church in September 1791.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was assessed under his father's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household.

<p>Apparently without the need to actively earn a living, he was chosen to sit on the boards Albany-based  turnpike companies.  Perhaps he managed his father's extensive real estate holdings across New York State.

<p>In April 1801, he married nineteen-year-old <a href="../j/majay2592.html">Maria Jay</a>, the daughter of governor <a href="../j/jjay.html">John Jay</a>. The marriage took place at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church in Abany. Their son and daughter were born in 1804 and 1805. But both died in childhood.

<p>Probably not yet forty, Goldsbrow Banyar, Jr. died in New York City in June 1806. Letters of administration on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a> were granted in Albany in July. His widow remained in Albany to care for his father until the elder Banyar passed in 1815.
