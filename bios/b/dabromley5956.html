<P>Future Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>David Bromley</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Bromlee) probably was born during the 1760s or early 70s. At this point, we  have not found that he was closely connected to the larger Albany <a href="bromley.html">Bromley</a> family. However, his origins appear to have been in <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a>.

<p>Perhaps he was the David Bromley listed as the head of a household in New London, Connecticut in <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33S7-9YYY-PFR?mode=g&i=20&wc=3XTM-1R6%3A1584071302%2C1584071301%2C1584070607%3Fcc%3D1803959&cc=1803959">1790</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, he first was noted in the community-based record on an assessment roll when his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house and lot "in <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Barr</a>ack St." was assessed modestly. His personal property was valued at $80.

<p>By July 1799, David "Bromlee" had married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Elspy Aikins when their son (Robert) was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1802, he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5G4tAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA357&lpg=PA357&dq=%22david+bromley%22+albany&source=bl&ots=U71JufCgbr&sig=9ezXca3j03HOuO0KmbW8nIrluBA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8qv32oLvKAhXJPT4KHZvqCc0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=%22david%20bromley%22%20albany&f=false">rented</a> a pew at the <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">United Presbyterian</a> Church where he also was a trustee. In June 1811, their daughter "Ann Eliza" was buried from that church as was a thirty-year-old namesake in 1829. 


<p>Beginning in 1800, he was licensed as a <a href="../../loc/public.html">tavern</a> owner by the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a>. 


<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#5956">1800</a>, the second ward census configured his household with a young couple and four males under ten. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, the census accounted for the growth of that family.


<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22bromley+david%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=bromley&f=false">1813</a>. he was identified as a grocer located at 50 Chapel Street.  During those years, a number of grocers were identified by <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Chapel Street</a> addresses. In 1817, David <a href="../../res/sp.html">Bromlee</a> was last listed in the directory at 44 Chapel. 

<p>In 1818, and at least for another decade, Elizabeth Bromlee was identified in the annual <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as the householder at 44 Chapel. Thus we <a href="../../res/guess.html">guess</a> that David had passed on. 
 
<p>With basic demographic <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> still unanswered, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany resident David Bromley.</p>
