<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony E. Bradt</b></a> was born in January 1727. He was a middle child in the family of Albany residents <a href="egbradt4347.html">Egbert</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3234.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Bradt.  He was known in the community as "Anthony E. Bradt."</p>
 
 
      <p>His marriage record is complicated! "Anthony E. Bradt's wife" was buried 
        from the Albany Dutch church in November 1761 - when he would have been 
        thirty-four-years-old! In 1764, he married Maria/Mollie Van Deusen. Their 
        son, Egbert, was born the following year. In 1773, he married the widow 
        <a href="../h/alhogan4291.html">Alida Hogan</a> Van Schaick. Between 1752 
        and 1777, five of his children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was an occasional baptism sponsor and probably a member.</p>
      <p><a href="#montreal">Perhaps</a> he was the Anthony Bradt of Albany who 
        was a prisoner at Montreal in 1756.</p>
      <p>His <a href="../../census1756.html#101">home</a> was along the waterfront 
        in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He was a ship's 
        carpenter but also identified as a farmer and businessman. City assessment 
        rolls from the 1760s and 70s testify to his prosperity.</p>
		
<p>Although he served as a firemaster in 1757, he did not hold municipal offices until he was elected to represent the third ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> in May 1775. He participated in committee work, lent financial support to the revolutionary cause, and was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">exempted</a> from active service in 1778 because of his age. In August, he <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#4204">commanded</a> a company of carpenters under the Quartermaster General. Later, he was granted a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city regiment of the County militia.</p>
		
<p>Anthony E. Bradt was dead by June 1785 when his heirs were referenced in a real estate transaction.</p>
