<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jannetie Beekman</b></a> was born in 1719. She was the eldest daughter of Albany merchant Johannes Beekman and his wife, Hester Wendell Beekman. In 1731, she was provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3859.html">will</a> of her father.</p>


<p>She married <a href="../c/abcuyler360.html">Abraham Cuyler, Jr.</a> at the Albany Dutch church in May 1744. The marriage produced only two daughters before Cuyler's untimely death in 1749. By that time, these Cuylers were living in New York City.</p>

<p>Unlike most young, early Albany widows, Jannetie Cuyler did not remarry. By the early 1760s, she had returned home, was counted as the head of a third ward household, and assessed as someone engaged in business. A decade later, she was assessed separately but <a href="../../census1790.html#4666">within</a> the State Street home of her daughter and son-in-law, <a href="../c/hecuyler537.html">Hester</a> and Leonard Gansevoort. Into the 1790s, she remained in business - selling textiles and lending money.</p>
 
<p>A widow for almost 50 years, She died in March 1798 at the age of seventy-nine. Jannetie Beekman Cuyler was buried from the Albany Dutch church where she was a lifelong member!</p>
