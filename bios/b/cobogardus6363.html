<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Bogardus</strong></a> is <a href="http://www.jonesgenealogy.org/familygroup.php?familyID=F223&tree=Jones">said</a> to have been born in October 1665. He was the son of Beverwyck/Albany residents <a href="cobogardus6362.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../t/heteller6609.html">Helena Teller</a> Bogardus. However, his father was dead by 1666 and his mother re-married. His <a href="../vb/jhvbael.html">stepfather</a> also lived in Albany until Van Bael's death in 1682. His mother married again and is said to have re-located to Manhattan. Presumably, Cornelis lived with his mother in Albany and New York for the first part of his life. 

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5Yk-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA506&lpg=PA506&dq=%22rachel+de+witt+%22kingston&source=bl&ots=DFYK1GLwt3&sig=Ecj9RhTp2hO2VFfutDLs5paBtHQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o5ldUZWUJKqK0QG7_YHwCw&sqi=2&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#">tell us</a> that he went with his uncle to live in Kingston.

<p>About 1691, he is said to have married Rachel De Witt of Kingston. Perhaps beginning in April 1692, the union produced a number of children (perhaps eight) who were christened in Kingston and in Albany (or at least by Albany-based <a href="../../drc.html">domines</a>).

<p>In December 1696, Cornelis was accepted as a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
 
<p>In January <a href="#1700">1700</a>, Cornelis Bogardus was <a href="http://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/106/mode/2up">identified</a> as a schoolmaster when he was granted the freedom of the city of Albany. However, we seek corroboration of his actual tenure in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1700pe">1700</a> and again in 1701, Cornelis Bogardus signed community-based petitions to the royal governor. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his property in the first ward of Albany was assessed moderately. After that, his name has not been encountered in the community-based record. 

<p>Cornelis Bogardus is said to have died in Kingston in October 1707.</p>
