<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jannetje Bleecker</b></a> was born early in 1673. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="jjbleecker2.html">Jan Janse</a> and <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">Margarita Van Woert</a> Bleecker. </p>

<p>In December 1698, she married <a href="../g/joglen4932.html">John Glen, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1706, three of her children were christened in Albany where she was a longtime church member. Her family was small due to the untimely death of John Glen, Jr. in September 1706. At age forty-three, her childbearing days probabaly were over. However, unlike <a href="../../marriages.html">many</a> younger widows, Jannetje Glen did not re-marry.</p>

<p>Despite having young children to raise, she remained the <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#197">head</a> of their <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> household for many years. Her <a hre="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home was located close to those of her father and brother. 

<p>Jannetje Bleecker Glen died in January 1755 and was buried beneath the Dutch church in Albany.</p>
