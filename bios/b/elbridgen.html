      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Elizabeth Bridgen</strong></a> is said to 
        have been born during the 1770s. She is said to have been the daughter 
        of Thomas Bridgen, a British-born physician and entrepreneur, and his 
        second wife, Catherine <a href="#te">Ten Eyck</a> Bridgen. Her parents 
        were said to be then living in New Jersey. However, we remain uncertain 
        of this Albany wife's background. 
      <p>In November 1799, the <i>New York Weekly Museum</i> <a href="http://boards.ancestry.myfamily.com/surnames.bleecker/24/mb.ashx">reported</a> 
        that "Eliza Bridgen of New York City" had married John Bleecker of Albany 
        at "Belleport." Thus, she had become the wife of Albany native <a href="jobleecker208.html">John 
        R. Bleecker, Jr.</a>  This merchant made his home on Market Street where she was accounted for on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#208">1800</a>. Their children were <a href="../../drc.html">christened</a> 
        in Albany in 1800 and 1804. However, their marriage would not be a long one.
      <p>Elizabeth Bridgen Bleecker or "John R. Bleecker's wife" died in March 
        1805 and was buried from the Dutch church. Her husband remarried in 1808 
        and lived until 1849. </p>
