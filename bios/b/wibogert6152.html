<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Willempie Bogert</strong></a> was born in June 1757. "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Wil</a>helmina" was the daughter of <a href="dobogert6089.html">Douwe</a> and <a href="wibradt4283.html">Willemptje Bradt</a> Bogert. She grew up as the youngest child of an Albany shoemaker who probably did not live into the 1770s. Willempie spent the remainder of her youth in the second ward household of her widowed mother.

<p>In August 1783, she married a somewhat older <a href="../f/jafonda3787.html">Jacobus Fonda</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1798, their ten children had been christened in Albany. Later, she would be identifed as a member of the Second Reformed church.

<p>However, the newlyweds first made their home in the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4283">house</a> of Willempie's widowed mother. By <a href="../../census1790.html#3787">1790</a>, James had become head of his own household probably located next door. In <a href="../../census1800.html#3787">1800</a>, their family consisted of nine members.  

<p>Jacobus (James) Fonda died in October 1807. The city census in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, identified widow Willempie as head of her household which still included five young members. A decade later, she still was named on the census.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=%22fonda+widow willimpy%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22fonda%20widow willimpy%22&f=false">1813</a>, the widow was listed in the city directory at 66 then 324 North Market Street. 

<p>Willempie Bogert Fonda is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=amfonda&id=ind00573">said</a> to have died in February 1832 at the age of seventy-four. She was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> at the Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
