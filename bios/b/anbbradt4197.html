<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony Barentse</b></a> was born in 1657. He was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="baalbradt4182.html">Barent Albertse</a> and <a href="../d/susdircks4368.html">Susanna Dircks</a> Bradt. He grew up in his father's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North end</a> home and at the family farm on the <a href="bradt.html">Normanskill</a>. He sometimes was called "Teunis." </p>

<p>In December 1685, he married <a href="../e/wiegb4544.html">Willempie Teunisz Egberts</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1708, their eleven children had been baptized at the church where both parents were members, frequent baptism sponsors, and where Anthony served as sexton.</p>

<p>These Bradts lived near his father just beyond the <a href="../../charter.html">new city's</a> north gate. By 1682, he had joined with his brother to take title to their father's sawmill. In <a href="../../census1697.html#082">1697</a>, his Albany home was configured on the census. Two years later, he joined with his neighbors in swearing <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4197">allegiance</a> to the king of England. Prosperous, his holdings later were valued comparable to those of other Albany merchants. As late as <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4197">1720</a>, he still was listed among the community's freeholders.</p> 

<p>Anthony Barentse served the community as well as the church as a financial officer. Known as the assessor and appraiser for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>, he then was elected city and county <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">treasurer</a> first in 1698. Re-elected annually, he served as chamberlain for more than two decades - collecting taxes, fines, and fees and authorizing disbursements for a range of items until his death in 1722.</p> 

<p>The children of this American-born community leader further established the <a href="bradt.html">Bradt family</a> in Albany and its hinterland. Anthony Barentse Bradt died and was buried in February 1722. He had lived about sixty-five years.</p>
