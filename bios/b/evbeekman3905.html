<strong>Eva Beekman</strong></a> (called <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible12.htm">Effie</a> by her family) was born in June 1720. She was the daughter of <a href="jabeekman3890.html">Jacob Beekman</a> and <a href="../h/dehansen4947.html">Debora Hansen</a> Beekman. She grew up in a businessman's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../wills/willjabeekman.html">1738</a>, she was named to receive a bequest from her father's estate. In 1747, she inherited a share of an Albany house. Her parents died while she was in her twenties.

<p>In September 1764, she was forty-four when she married widower <a href="../g/jogansevoort4665.html">Johannes Gansevoort</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Her daughter was born thirteen months later and buried a year after that in the church where she was a pewholder for the rest of her life. Perhaps the marriage produced another child.

<p>These Gansevoorts operated the family brewery that had fallen to Johannes Gansevoort in 1762. Family <a href="../../books.html#apkgans">tradition</a> holds that the brewery went back to the Gansevoorts following Johannes's death in 1781.

<p>Effie Beekman Gansevoort probably lived out her days in the homes of kin until she passed in September 1798. She had lived seventy-eight years.</p>
