<strong>Benjamin Bradt</strong></a> was born in May 1698. He was the son of <a href="anbbradt4197.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../e/wiegb4544.html">Willempie Egberts</a> Bradt. He grew up in the large family of a prominent businessman and official who died in 1722 leaving a widow and a number of offspring.

<p>In 1715, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In November 1720, younger son Benjamin married the somewhat older brewer's daughter <a href="../r/magryckman1976.html">Magdalena Ryckman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1731, five children had been christened in the church where he succeeded his father as sexton and served for many years. Both parents also were frequent baptism sponsors. Additionally, Benjamin was paid for <a href="../../dead.html">burial</a> services on a regular basis lasting into the mid-1770s.

<p>These Bradts made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> near those of both their families. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1727">1727</a>, he was appointed firemaster. In September 1734, he received a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">deed</a> to a lot on the Plain from the city. 

<p>In December 1736, he was named co-executor of his father-in-law's <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">estate</a>.

<p>His older brothers assumed the public presences pioneered by their father. Although his name was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">absent</a> from city voter lists until <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4213">1763</a>, Benjamin Bradt was a <a href="../../census1756.html#37">mason</a> and an Albany mainstay for more than a half century. He also performed a number of fee-based services including gatekeeping and general maintenance. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4213">70s</a>, his third ward property was assigned modest assessments. 

<p>By the end of the war, the name of Benjamin Bradt had dropped from Albany rolls. Several children became Albany residents.</p>
