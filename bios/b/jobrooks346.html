<strong>Jonathan Brooks</strong></a> probably was born during the early 1700s. He was the patriarch of the Brooks family of early Albany. We seek information on his origins and early life. 

<p>He was in Albany by 
April 1727 when he married <a href="../t/retott.html">Rebecca</a> "Tattein" (<a href="http://www.e-familytree.net/F52/F52325.htm">Totten</a>) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, four daughters had been christened in Albany. His marriage also produced at least one son. 

<p>In November 1729, he purchased a lot at the foot of <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> for twenty-two pounds. It was <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">said</a> to have been on the west side of what became <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">Pearl Street</a>. In March 1733, "he purchased" vacant land next to the brickyard of <a href="../h/luhoog3604.html">Luycas Hooghkerk</a>. That one acre parcel was on Gallows Hill near "a small run of water, to the north of the road." A year later, he was indebted to the city and given eight days to pay his debts.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#346">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> freeholders. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his Albany property was valued and his son <a href="pebrooks2665.html">Peter</a> was noted on  the assessment. 

<p>After that, the name "Jonathan Brooks" appears regularly in the community <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a>. With other same-named individuals born in Albany beginning in <a href="jobrooks347.html">1738</a>, we hesitate to assign qualitative information to this individual who would have been in his seventies during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a> of the American Revolution. 

<p>However, we believe this Jonathan Brooks lived into the 1770s. In July 1773, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cUEGAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0SdQviRfC0XjhNLLiv#PPA146,M1">named</a> co-executor of the estate of his brother-in-law - a Dutchess County farmer. John Totten's will also provided for his sister, Rebecca Brooks, and her children.</p>
