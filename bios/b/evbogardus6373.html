<P><a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Bogardus-144">Fa</a>mily-based resources tell us that <a href="#sources"> <strong>Evert Bogardus</strong></a> probably was born during the third quarter of the seventeenth century - prior to surviving baptism records at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  He was the son of Albany residents <a href="pibogardus6381.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="wybosch.html">Wyntie Bosch</a> Bogardus.

<p>In May 1697, he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Taatje" <a href="http://www.mrjumbo.com/contents/genealogy/dewitt/emmerentje/index.html">Hoffman</a> at the Dutch church in Kingston. At that time, he was <a href="http://www.ancestralcurios.com/kingston_marriages.htm">id</a>entified as a single man born in Albany and his bride was a native of New York. Both partners then were living in Kingston.  By 1713, at least four (or six) of their <a href="http://www.geocities.ws/sean.furniss/Bogardus/Bogardus.html#Index28">children</a> were christened at the Kingston church.

      <p>Probably during the early 1700s, his father relocated to Kingston where he 
        filed a <a hre="../../wills/willpibogardus6381.html">will</a> in February 
        1702. Although not initially named in the <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus6381.html">will</a> 
        document, in May 1714, letters of administration were granted to "his 
        son Evert Bogardus." 
      <p>In 1700, "Evert Bogardus" was <a href="http://genealogy-quest.com/military-records/1700-militia-officers-new-york/">listed</a> as a lieutenant of an Ulster/Dutchess militia company. 
 
<p>Kingston resident Evert Bogardus is said to have died there in April 1717. Named for his legendary grandfather, a number of same named individuals complicate the assignment of qualitative information.
