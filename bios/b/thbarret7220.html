<strong>Thomas Barret</strong></a> was born in March 1692. He was the son of <a href="robarret7221.html">Robert</a> and Wyntie Jans Barret. His father was an Albany <a href="../../corporation.html#marshall">placeman</a> and his mother was the daughter of a <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> family. Their home was in the soldier enclave on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>. 

<p>In December 1713, Thomas married <a href="../s/baspoor6525.html">Barrentje Spoor</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1719, the marriage had produced three children who were christened in Albany. The last baptism took place on March 8.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In April 1718, he petitioned to purchase a lot in the city of Albany.

<p>On March 14, 1719, his widow paid nine poinds for a lot against <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> and next to the pasture of  <a href="../m/jtmingael6193.html">Johannes Mingael</a>.

<p>Thus, Thomas Barret was dead by March 14, 1719. Remember, his last child was christened six days earlier with no mention of the father being dead. He had lived just twenty-seven years. His widow supported her family as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> and lived until 1760.</p>
