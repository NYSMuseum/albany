<P><A href="#biography"><B>John Beasley</B></A> was born about 1678. In 1714, this middle-aged man was identified as a private in the Coxsackie company of the Albany County militia.</p>

<p>In 1723, the forty-five year old Beasley married widow <a href="../d/lydealy5402.html">Lydia Dealy</a> (Dailey) Van Benthuysen in the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch Church</a>. The first of their two children was baptized there seven months later. However, Beasley's Albany family was much larger as Lydia's five Van Benthuysen children also were living in their <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> home.</P>

<p>John Beasley's Albany life was closely connected to the recently opened <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> Anglican Church. In 1730, he was identified as the schoolmaster at St. Peters. In the years that followed, he was paid by the <a href="#spg">SPG</a> for instructing as many as fifty "negroes" in the cathecism. As late as 1768, Beasley and his wife still were mentioned as communicants at St. Peters.

<p>In 1737, his lot was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willjrosie.html">will</a> of a neighbor.

<p>During the 1730s and 40s, John Beasley's name was associated with community-based activities including appearing as a qualified voter in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>.</p>

<p>By the 1750s, Beasley appears to have left Albany. His <a href="#southside">Southside  holdings</a> devolved to his son, Henry, and son-in-law, <a href="../c/ricartwright6508.html">Richard Cartwright</a>. He was dead by August 1768 when letters of administration on the estate were granted to his <a href="hebeasley7286.html">son</a>.</p>

Subsequent documents identify him as fifty-five years old in 1733 - fixing Beasley's birth date as about 1678. However, little has been found on his origins, early life, or about the years after 1747.</P>
