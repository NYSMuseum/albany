<strong>Hendrick Bleecker</strong></a> was born in April 1686. He was a younger son in the large family of Albany stalwarts <a href="jjbleecker2.html">Jan Janse</a> and <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">Maragrita Van Woert</a> Bleecker. He grew up in the <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home of a prominent <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> and probably spent considerable time in his  younger days representing Bleecker family interests in the Indian country.

<p>Like a number of other Albany-born frontier traders, Hendrick may not have <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> but was a long time member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1720">1720</a>, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the second ward. In 1723, and on several occasions over the next four <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#183">decades</a>, he was identified as an Albany <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchant</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#136">1756</a>, he was listed on the census of Albany householders as an "Indian Trader" - even though he would have been about seventy-years- old. He may have been the partner of John <a href="../g/joglen4934.html">Glen</a> and was identified with Glen as the occupants of a house in the second ward in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>. Over the years, he owned other pieces of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> as well. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#183">1763</a>, he was listed as a freeholder living in the city of Albany. In 1742, the royal governor appointed him to the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>.

<p>Hendrick Bleecker died in January 1768 and was buried from his church. The burial bill was paid by his partner.</p>
