      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter Brooks</strong></a> may have been 
        <a href="http://www.linkstothepast.com/milwaukee/dar_members.php#156847">born</a> 
        in 1732 or in 1738. He probably was the son of <a href="jobrooks346.html">Jonathan</a> 
        and Rebecca Tatten Brooks. He grew up with several siblings in a modest 
        <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> home. 
      <p> 
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, he was noted on 
        the Albany assessment roll with his father, Jonathan. In 1779, his lot 
        in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was valued modestly. 
        In January 1767, his account was paid from the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> 
        treasury. 
      <p>In 1768, he was listed among the subscribers at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Anglican church. At that time, one person was in his family. 
      <p>In May <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#2665">1767</a>, he had been 
        identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. About fifty at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, 
        we <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on his activities 
        during the 1770s. After the War for Independence, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2665">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the regiment that was drawn from 
        the city of Albany. 
      <p>In November 1771, he married "Santje Wendels" (<a href="../w/frwendell2666.html">Frances 
        Wendell</a>) at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. 
        At that time, both partners were identified as "of this city." In that 
        year, he was counted among the <a href="../../coerec1771.html#2665">members</a> 
        at St. Peter's. During those years, he witnessed a number of christenings 
        with several Albany women. Until 1790, a number of baptisms with Peter 
        Brooks as the father were recorded in St. Peter's and at the Dutch church. 
        His <a href="pebrooks352.html">son</a> and namesake was born in 1780 and 
        lived and worked in Albany for many years. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2665">1790</a>, the household of Peter 
        Brooks with eleven family members and three slaves was included on the 
        census for Watervliet. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information 
        on his residence and occupation. We believe that his <a href="pebrooks352.html">son</a> 
        was the carpenter who was listed in city directories at 100 Hudson Street 
        from 1813 to 1830. 
      <p>"Frances Brooks, wife of Peter Brooks," <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=%22Frances+Brooks,+wife+of+Peter+Brooks%22&source=bl&ots=Sr9xPNwmCm&sig=ynabBlt5hqMoeGsSMKxrDR6DdQk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiUj77-1r3JAhUBWD4KHUBDDsYQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=%22Frances%20Brooks%2C%20wife%20of%20Peter%20Brooks%22&f=false">died</a> 
        in April 1818 at the age of sixty-five. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a> 
        this Peter Brooks lived until March 1825. </p>
