<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelia Bogert</b></a> probably was born in the colony of New York during the 1670s.</p>


<p>In October 1696, she married Albany native <a href="../q/woq2323.html">Wouter Quackenbush, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both marriage partners were identified as single (unmarried) people living in Albany. By 1709, their five children had been baptized at the Albany church where Neeltie was a lifelong member</p>

<p>This couple set up their home on Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> near the other <a href="../q/q.html">Quackenbush</a> properties. In <a href="../../census1697.html#114">1697</a>, she and her husband were alone in their third ward home. 

<p>Cornelia Bogert Quackenbush died in November 1735 and was buried from the Dutch church. Her husband died a year later.</p>
