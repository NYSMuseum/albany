<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Nehemiah B. Bassett</strong></a> was born in Middletown, Connecticut about 1770.

<p>He was married and had a family. These Bassetts were members of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. Nehemiah was a church elder.

<p>By the late <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1790s</a>, he was living in Albany in a modest house on what became Division Street. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7261">1800</a>, his first ward home with two adults and two children was configured on the Albany census. 


<p>He was a noted <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silver</a> and goldsmith and beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22nehemiah+b.+bassett%22&source=web&ots=2hJsOUXyav&sig=WUHEtBXupGn-5QySkeCAFUXTrsQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result#PPA55,M1">1813</a> was identified as a watchmaker with a house on Division Street and a shop at 42 State Street. Within a few years, his address was given as 31 <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a>.  He was a member and officer of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. A number of his finely crafted <a href="http://antiquesandthearts.com/AW-2006-01-31-14-38-37p1.htm">clocks</a> have survived.

<p>About 1818, he was called on to verify information regarding the <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> of first ward neighbor Thomas Barret. At that time, he was still a goldsmith living in the city of Albany.

<p>About 1820, he removed to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where he died in December 1844. Nehemiah B. Bassett had lived seventy-four years.
