<P><A href="#sources"><B>John R. Bleecker</B></a> was born in 1713. He was the eldest son of <a href="rjbleecker227.html">Rutger Janse</a> and <a href="../s/caschuyler1241.html">Catherina 
        Schuyler</a> Bleecker. The boy grew up in his mother's family home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> as the son of the <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany. He followed the <a href="bleecker.html">family</a> business tradition - traveling beyond Albany to trade for <a href="../../furtrade.html">furs</a> as well as dealing in wine and foodstuffs. John also developed the special skills of the surveyor and map maker.</p>
 
<p><a href="#map"><img src="../../images/jpg/maps/map1767logo.jpg" align=left hspace=4 vspace=4 width=200 border=1 alt=imprint on his map of 1767"></a>Settling 
        into Albany life at age 30, this third generation American married seventeen-year-old 
        <a href="../../bios/s/elstaats4566.html">Elizabeth Staats</a> in August 
        1743. They set up a home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        that became an Albany landmark. The marriage produced eight children, 
        five of whom lived to adulthood. Three sons each named Barent, after Elizabeth's 
        father, died in infancy. A <a href="barbleecker150.html">fourth</a> "Barent" became a prominent Albany resident.</p>

<p>In 1756, John R. <a href="../../wills/willrjbleecker227.html">inherited</a> one-third of his father's personal estate and one half of his real estate. That same year, he was identified on the <a href="../../census1756.html#132">city census</a> as a "rich" man.</p>

<p>In 1746, he was appointed Albany County <a href="../../sheriffs.html#201">sheriff</a>. This Albany mainstay served on the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> for twenty-five years as assistant and alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. During his long tenure, Bleecker  was called upon regularly to represent Albany in rent and land disputes.</p>

      <p>But his principal legacy was as a surveyor - laying out tracts and property 
        lines within Albany and beyond. His map of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        dated 1767 has become a major historical resource.</p>

<p>In May 1775, he was elected to represent the second ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. However, a month later the sixty-two-year-old Bleecker was given permission to resign. Although he played no active role in the crusade for American liberties, he was granted a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany regiment of the militia.</p> 

<p>By the 1770s, John R. and his family were spending more time at their country home in Saratoga while <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#201">maintaining</a> their <a href="../../census1790.html#201">Pearl Street residence</a> as well. John and Elizabeth owned substantial acreage in what became Montgomery, Otsego, Herkimer, and land on the Schoharie River.

<p>In April 1788, he joined with a group of Albany contemporaries in <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#201">signing</a> a published statement opposing ratification of the Federal Consititution. 

<p>John R. Bleecker filed a <a href="../../wills/willjorbleecker201.html">will</a> in March 1792. It left the Pearl Street home, two other houses, and lands beyond Albany to his three living sons. He died in October 1800 at the age of eighty-seven. His widow lived on as <a href="../../census1800.html#4566">head</a> of the Pearl Street home and died sometime after 1802.</p>
