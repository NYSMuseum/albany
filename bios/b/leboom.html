<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Lena Boom</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Helena) was born about 1720. We seek defining <a href="#boom">info</a>rmation on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Perhaps she was a member of the "Boom" <a href="#boom">family</a> inhabiting the Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a> during her lifetime. 

<p>In June 1742, Lena married Albany native <a href="wmbromley5965.html">William Bromley</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as single people. By 1757, seven children had been christened in Albany churches. Throughout her lifetime, these Bromleys received spiritual services from the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</A>.

      <p>After starting out in a house rented from the city government, by the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, 
        William Bromley was being assessed for his property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. William Bromley probably died afterwards as their sons seem 
        to have carried on the family legacy during the 1770s, 80s, and 90s. 
      <p>Perhaps the aging Lena was accounted for in the second ward household of her son Samuel in <a href="../../census1800.html#5963">1800</a> and in other countings as well. 

<p>By July 1799, William Bromley's widow was listed on an Albany <a href="../../poor.html#lebo">Poor List</a> and was scheduled to receive 15 pounds. 
<p>Lena Boom Bromley was <a href="../../dead.html">burying</a> her children as late as 1801. However, she has not been accounted for after that in the community-based record. </p>

          surname appear in church and civil sources on Albany County during the 
          eighteenth century. At this point, we cannot connect them to (and suspect 
          they do not belong with) the Hogebooms or Rosebooms. Also, no men have 
          been identified as residents of the city of Albany. This <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/report/rr20/rr20_131.html">page</a> 
          contains information on some of Helena's contemporary kin. Perhaps she
