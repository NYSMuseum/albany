      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Lewis Benedict</strong></a> is <a href="http://www.sprague-database.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I176591&tree=SpragueProject#cite1">said</a> 
        to have been born in November 1785. He was the first son born to the marriage 
        of Uriah and Ruth Rockwell Benedict who had migrated west from Fairfield 
        County, Connecticut. By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his 
        father had settled their budding family in Ballstown. 
      <p>In January 1812, Lewis married Albany native <a href="../s/stafford.html">Susan 
        Stafford</a>. By 1830, the marriage had produced at least eight children. 
      <p>Beginning with the first issue in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=%22benedict+lewis%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22benedict%20lewis%22&f=false">1813</a>, 
        the Albany city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> listed 
        his residence at 51 Lydius Street and his store at 3 State Street. At 
        the same time, the "widow of Uriah" Benedict (probably his sister-in-law) 
        was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA55&lpg=PA55&dq=%22benedict+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22benedict%20widow%22&f=false">listed</a> 
        nearby at 38 Dock Street. 
      <p>This individual was a merchant in partnership with his in-laws, the <a href="../s/stafford.html">Staffords</a>, 
        until 1825 when finally he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=%22stafford,+benedict+%26+co.%22&source=bl&ots=cNmV2Ce9SU&sig=BkGXes-WDQfkQMpzQZVkIVrRwQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=x6AET5G1J6Td0QGY6ZXGCg&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22stafford%2C%20benedict%20%26%20co.%22&f=false">left</a> 
        that business. He was months shy of his fortieth birthday. We must summarize 
        his subsequent life and career <a href="../../inprog.html">after</a> that 
        time. 
      <p>This Lewis Benedict bought and sold <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        property</a> alone and with others in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> but also along what became Washington Avenue in the newly opened 
        western part of the city. 
      <p>He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&pg=PA438&lpg=PA438&dq=%22lewis+benedict%22+july+1862+albany&source=bl&ots=_sJfSKwtxe&sig=leJnnMxOOtB8ERjWc7l1nLGbukQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zqMET-EO4uvSAf6j6NwP&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22lewis%20benedict%22%20july%201862%20albany&f=false">said</a> 
        to have been the Albany <a href="../../org/po.html">po</a>stmaster during 
        most of the 1850s. 
      <p>Lewis Benedict is <a href="http://awt.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=flakey&id=I567193498&ti=5542">said</a> 
        to have died in July 1862 and was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=5788020&PIpi=19448165">buried</a> 
        at the Albany Rural Cemetery - his grave marked by a substantial <a href="http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=132570YK0322S.2077&profile=ariall&uri=link=3100012~!166188~!3100001~!3100002&aspect=Browse&menu=search&ri=2&source=~!siartinventories&term=Portrait+male+--+Benedict+Sr.%2C+Lewis+--+Bust&index=SUBJX#focus">monument</a>. 
        His widow survived until 1869.</p>

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Lewis Benedict 
        is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 7306. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> 
        is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The basic 
        family-based resource is Henry Marvin Benedict, <i>The Genealogy of the 
        Benedicts in America</i> (Albany, NY, 1870). 
        <dd><dd>An unsubstantiated source holds that he was born in Saratoga County 
          which would place his parents there by 1785. No supporting evidence 
          has been uncovered at this time. However, the Ballstown households of 
          two Uriah Benedicts were configured on the census 1n 1790. In <a href="../../census1800.html#bl">1800</a>, 
          the first ward household of a "Benedict Lewis" was included on the Albany 
          census when the subject of this sketch would have been about fifteen.
		  
<p>Confusion <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=5788020&PIpi=19448165">abounds</a> in the assignment of information between this individual who died       in 1862 and a much younger but same-named Union army officer who was killed in Louisiana in 1864.
