<P>According to family-based <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BkxmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA422&lpg=PA422&dq=%22nancy+or%22&source=bl&ots=l-E3hShDf1&sig=qH6c3F_-YpvMHk2ve7QgFlIMXxU&hl=en&ei=zeMgTOm-HsL_lge26aw1&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22nancy%20or%22&f=false">res</a>ources,  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nancy Boyd</strong></a> was born in February 1760. Thus, she was the only daughter of <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish emigres <a href="joboyd7399.html">John</a> and <a href="../l/anlogan7596.html">Ann Logan</a>. She grew up in a large <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=site%3Awww.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+boyd&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=&gs_rfai=">family</a> with several brothers who became residents of Albany and its environs.


<p>In May 1786, she married <a href="../m/pemchench.html">Peter Melhench</a> at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church where at least two of their children were christened beginning in July 1787. Nancy <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Ann <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</A> Agnes and most of the Boyds were <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/albany_ny_1st_presby.htm">members</a> of the Albany meeting house and her husband was a deacon and elder.

<p>During the 1790s, Nancy's parents are said to have removed to Johnstown where her father died in 1799.

<p>However, these Mc Henches raised their family on <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> and were Albany <a href="../../census1800.html#pmch">mainstays</a> for many years. Peter was a carpenter and in business with members of the Boyd family. After the death of her husband, Nancy's widowed mother returned to Albany and lived in the Mc Hench home until her passing in 1815. 

<p>Peter Mc Hench died in October 1822. After that, their son William was acknowledged as the head of the family home at the corner of South Pearl and Hudson. Nancy Boyd, the widow of Peter Mc Hench, died in 1851. She had lived in Albany for the best part of ninety-one years.</p>
