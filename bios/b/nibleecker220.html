<strong>Nicholas Bleecker, Jr.</strong></a> was born in September 1702. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="jjbleecker199.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../c/acoster5969.html">Anna Coster</a> Bleecker. He was known as "Nicholas Bleecker, Jr." to prevent confusion with a  <a href="nibleecker219.html">bachelor uncle</a>. &nbsp; Nicholas Jr. grew up in a prominent businessman's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in the midst of a large extended family. His father had been appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany in 1701.

<p>In April 1728, he married <a href="../r/mgtroseboom1941.html">Margarita Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1748, seven of their children had been christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor. 

<p>These Bleeckers also lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Nicholas was a merchant and also served in municipal offices culminating in his election as <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> in 1743. He was an active member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners</a> of Indian Affairs and a contractor of the city. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">1742</a>, he was identified as a freeholder of Albany. 

<p>In November, 1737, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> of his father-in-law. 
<p>Nicholas Bleecker, Jr. died in January 1751 at the age of forty-eight. His widow survived him by more than forty years.</p>
