<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Magdalena Bogert</strong></a> was born in January 1726. She was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="pibogert6070.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../f/refonda3770.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Bogert. She grew up in the third ward home of a long-lived, mainline shoemaker. Her mother died in 1754.

<p>In June 1757, we <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yZNQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=%22magdalena+bogart%22+spoor&source=bl&ots=-0y5IUKwE6&sig=y9Mh_ru7hfTWPwfHZpI89ge0ge0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SZbmUsiVNNSGoQST34GQCw&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22magdalena%20bogart%22%20spoor&f=false">believe</a> that she married <a href="../s/jospoor6529.html">Johannes Spoor</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At the time of the marriage, she was thirty-one and her husband was in his mid-forties.  By 1767, the marriage appears to have produced four children whose names honored their grandparents. Both parents were regular baptism sponsors at the Albany church throughout that time period.

<p>This Spoor family lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where their property was valued moderately. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6529">1790</a>, the household of Johannes Spoor included two boys, two men, and two females - presumably, one was his sixty-something wife. Johannes Spoor died sometime thereafter.

<p>We seek defining information on the later life and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a> of Albany resident Magdalena Bogert Spoor. </p>
