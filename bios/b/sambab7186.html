      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Babbington</strong></a> probably 
        was born in Europe and before 1690. Perhaps he came to America to serve 
        in the British <a href="../../7yw.html">army</a> about 1711. By 1715, 
        he was identified as a lieutenant and was living in Albany. 
      <p>In November 1711, his name was on a <a href="../../sources.html#sh">list</a> 
        of lieutenants who had been sent to America from England "for the late 
        expedition." A month later, he was identified as a lieutenant who had 
        been involved in "defence of the frontiers last winter." In 1714, he was 
        among the lieutenants scheduled to be paid for service on the Canada expedition. 
        In 1738, a "Sam'll Babbington" was on a roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. 
      <p>In October 1712, he was one of those who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjjoud.html">will</a> 
        of an Albany area tradesman. 
      <p>Beginning in April 1714, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pCQ2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=%22samuell+babbington%22&source=bl&ots=I7TiOBHnzk&sig=dDRCA__Jwc1Pat5bmZ45PJZiZC0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=t9J8U8KxKcq_oQSq4IDIAg&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22samuell%20babbington%22&f=false">petitioned</a> 
        for and received a flat parcel of land on the south side of the Mohawk 
        24 miles west of Schenectady formerly held by Robert Sanders. The tract 
        totaling<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pCQ2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=babbington+%22343+acres%22&source=bl&ots=I7TiOBHqEj&sig=QEQuIs_mJ46Pu1HAzss-7zlFLQ0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FNR8U7HFH4_8oASwvoGQAg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=babbington%20%22343%20acres%22&f=false">343 
        acres</a> would be known as "Babbington's Patent" and was held in conjunction 
        with his daughter, Elizabeth Babbington. During those transactions, he 
        was characterized as a resident of the city of Albany. 
      <p>In October 1715, he petitioned the city council for a plot on the north 
        side of the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. He also 
        asked to rent some "bush land" adjoining the path leading to the mill 
        of <a href="../v/frhvisscher4069.html">Frederick Visgers</a>. In March 
        1716, he asked to rent fifteen acres on the "<a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Flatts</a> 
        of Evert Wendell." 
      <p>In 1716, he was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of 
        Albany city and county by the provincial government. In 1719, he was replaced 
        by <a href="../vs/gevschaick3952.html">Gerrit Van Schaick</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#7186">1720</a>, he was identified 
        as a freeholder living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. 
      <p>His wife was named Elsie. Their two daughters were christened at the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1716 and 1722. 
      <p>Samuel Babbington was last heard from in Albany in October 1733 when 
        the <a href="../h/hehallenbeck5274.html">house</a> he "formerly owned" was 
        referenced by the city council.</p>
