      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit Bogert</strong></a> was born in March 
        1770. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany natives and residents <a href="hebogert6097.html">Hendrick</a> 
        and <a href="../m/bamarselis634.html">Barbara Marselis</a> Bogert. 
      <p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/gerbogertea.jpg" width=170 align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=8 alt="Gerrit Bogert"></a> 
        He grew up in a sloop captain's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> in a family with several ambitious, older <a href="bogert.html#sons">brothers</a>. 
        His father also was the first Albany city <a href="../../trades/sur.html">surveyor</a> 
        - a skill he passed along to at least two of his sons. 
      <p> In January 1795, Gerrit married Margaret Pels Nixon at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. By 1810, four children had been christened in Albany. In 1815, 
        he joined the <a href="../../drc.html#second">Second</a> Reformed church. 
      <p>This fourth son of an established family was trained in the <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a> 
        and admitted to practice in May 1793 as certified by <a href="../y/ryates.html">Robert 
        Yates</a>, chief justice of New York State. 
      <p>In August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#mont">1797</a>, a great fire 
        destroyed the Montgomery Street "dwellinghouse" of Peter Dox. At that 
        time, "Mr. G. Bogart" lived there with the owner. 
      <p>After that, these Bogerts were Albany mainstays who resided at 12 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson</a> 
        Street - a location close to the Albany <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">city 
        hall</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6092">1800</a>, their four-member 
        household was served by four slaves. 
      <p>During the 1800s, <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> 
        identified him as a member of the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a>, 
        justice, magistrate, and on the boards of serveral Albany organizations. 
        He also held the position of city surveyor from about 1813 at least thru 
        1818. 
      <p>During the early 1800s, he purchased several 40-50 acre lots in <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> 
        from the city of Albany. 
      <p>Gerrit Bogert died in 1820. He was but fifty years old. His widow was 
        listed in the directory at 12 Hudson that same year. In 1867, his remains 
        were re-interred at the <a href="http://www.albanyruralcemetery.org/albrurcem/index.html">Albany 
        Rural Cemetery</a>.</p>
