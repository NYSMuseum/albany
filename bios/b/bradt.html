<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <A href="#sources"><B>Bradts</B></A> were a large and successful Norwegian-ancestry family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>.         The Bradts of early Albany are descended from <a href="#brothers">brothers</a> 
        known as <a href="../../bios/b/albanbradt4180.html">Albert</a> and <a href="../../bios/b/aranbradt4181.html">Arent</a> 
        Andriesse who came to America in 1637. The family settled in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        and within a generation established households in Albany, Schenectady, 
        and throughout what became <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> 
        in 1683.</P>

        a large family around his mill on the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#nrmskl">Normanskill</a>, 
        the Bradts prospered in farming, husbandry (chiefly sawing), and found 
        some success in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> as well. 
        By the time of his death in 1686, Albert Andriesse had joined his grown 
        sons as residents of the new <a href="../../earlycity.html">city of Albany</a>. 
        Younger brother Arent was among the pioneers of the village of Schenectady.</P>
      <p><a name=vdz></a>In <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>, four Bradt 
        households were listed on the Albany census including that of Albert's 
        son, <a href="../../bios/vd/svdz.html">Storm Van Der Zee</a>, who was 
        born during the family's Atlantic crossing four decades earlier. The Vanderzees 
        are his descendants but trace their ancestry to the original Bradt &eacute;migr&eacute;. 
        By <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, seven Bradt (and <a href="../../census1697.html#010">Vanderzee</a>) 
        family homes can be clearly identified on the city census.</p>

        who found success in late seventeenth century Albany.</p>
      <p>Over the next generations, the family grew and spread throughout the 
        region. A census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a> 
        showed the home of city treasurer <a href="barbradt4212.html">Barent Bradt</a> 
        among six Bradt-named household. Four of those were the homes of city 
        tradesmen. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, six Bradt houses 
        were only the most visible part of numerous Albany and Albany area homes 
        that were anchored by Bradt-born wives and mothers. At that time, fifteen 
        more Bradt-named households were configured in surrounding <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1815</a>, twelve Bradt-named households 
        appeared in the city directory.</p>

      <FONT size=-1> <B>Sources:</B> Profiles of members of this mainline early 
      Albany family are derived chiefly from <a href="../../fhg.html#bfh">family</a> 
      and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. A <a href="../../famrecon.html">family 
      reconstitution</a> was performed on the Bradt family by project intern Rashann 
      Duvall in 1997. Although derivative of previous works, the best <u>online</u> 
      resource on the family appears under the <a href="http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/surnames/bradt.shtml">Olive 
      Tree</a>. More family based resources are available <a href="http://members.shaw.ca/joanbradtwood/">online</a>. 

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today, the <a href="http://www.bradtfamilysociety.org">Bradt 
        Family Society</a> is keenly interested in the family's history and has 
        sponsored and promoted many valuable products and programs. In my long 
        association with this group, the work and energy of two excellent personages 
        deserve special mention. In the beginning, Ken Bradt was a driving force 
        in mobilizing family heritage resources and of sustaining the excitement 
        for many years. Also, there at the beginning, Cynthia Brott Biasca's monumental 
        family-based inquiries have given us <a href="../../fhg.html#bfh"><i>Descendants 
        of Albert and Arent Andriessen Bradt</i></a>, and have set up a format for future learning.

        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a name=brothers></a>Albert and Arent were pioneer settlers of the 
          area. Albert was not really a resident of the city of Albany. However, 
          Arent was an original settler of Beverwyck - although he lived there 
          but a short time. Both have been <a href="../../inprog.html">assigned</a>
