<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Butler</strong></a> was a British army officer on duty on the New York frontier at least during the 1740s and 50s. He <a href="../qqqq.html">appears</a> to have had some connection to Albany.

<p>This Thomas Butler <a href="http://www.gulbangi.com/5families-o/p231.htm">may</a> have been a native of Connecticut and thus would have been born in 1716.

<p>Captain Butler was an associate and correspondant of <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> and frequently <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/papersofsirwilli14johnuoft#page/72/mode/2up">referenced</a> in his papers.
                
<p>In October 1744, he was named in the 
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wBsXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=%22Charles+Kerr,+Doctor%22&source=bl&ots=ZGSTSru6R0&sig=SrPnJQaLoLVsILHQ3q_BjY-mxoo&hl=en&ei=5SUNTMf_AcGAlAf-3IjcDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22Charles%20Kerr%2C%20Doctor%22&f=false">will</a> filed by the physician at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. He was identified as the son of Lieutenant Walter Butler and the brother of Walter. The sons were left clothing and a hat then in possession of <a href="../c/hecoster5975.html">Hendrick Coster</a> [ son of Albany resident <a href="../c/antcoster5968.html">Anthony Coster</a> ] of Albany.

<p>The <a href="http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/y/yates_c.htm">Christopher Yates Papers</a> at Syracuse University hold a journal kept by Captain Thomas Butler from April and May 1756 that describes his trip to Oswego.

<p>This individual's sister, Mary, became the second wife of Albany jurist <a href="../vd/jovdh5697.html">Johannes Vanderheyden</a> at a ceremony in the Dutch church in Schenectady in 1758.

<p>Butler became ill and, by early 1759, was unable to attend to his military obligations. Johnson expressed concern over his declining health on a number of occasions.

<p>In September 1759, Thomas Butler filed a <a href="../../wills/willthbutler.html">will</a> stating that he was of Albany. Only siblings and their children [probably meaning no direct heirs] were named in the will. All three witnesses were Albany residents. The will passed probate on September 25.</p>

This compelling individual probably was not much of an Albany resident so our treatment of him must be curtailed.
