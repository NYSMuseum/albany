            <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Henry Barclay</B></A> was born in Albany 
              in 1712. He was the oldest of the four sons of St. Peters founder 
              <a href="tbarclay.html">Thomas Barclay</a> and <a href="../d/andodrayer.html">Anna 
              Dorothea Drayer</a>.</P>
            <p>Henry grew up following his father on a ministry that included 
              missions into the Indian country as well as service to the settler 
              populations of Albany and its hinterland. As his father's health 
              deteoriated during Henry's adolescence, Henry began to feel a call 
              to the ministry himself.</P>
            <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/hebarclay.jpg" align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Henry Barclay, D. D." width=200></a> 
            <p>Following the death of Thomas Barclay in 1726, Henry was sent to 
              Yale University. He graduated in 1734 but <a href="#yale">continued 
              his studies</a> at the graduate level. By the mid-1730s he was serving 
              as a catechist among the Mohawks at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort 
              Hunter</a>. He was ordained in England in January 1738 and returned 
              home to become rector of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> 
              that same year.</P>
            <p>Like his father, Henry Barclay's tenure at St. Peters cast him 
              in the dual roles of missionary and rector. The diversity of his 
              flock required him to preach in English, Dutch, and Mohawk. He was 
              particularly interested in converting and catechizing Native peoples 
              and was instrumental in having the book of common prayer translated 
              into the Mohawk language. He was most zealous in campaigning against 
              drunkeness among the Indians and was recognized for his efforts 
              in that area. In 1740, he was able to purchase land from the Mohawks 
              at Canajoharie to be used as a glebe. After Barclay removed to New 
              York, the Mohawks wanted it back creating a <a href="#controversy">controversy</a> 
              that tested the diplomatic skills of <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir 
              William Johnson</a>.</P>
            <p>After a decade of service in Albany and on the frontier, in 1746, 
              Henry Barclay was named rector of <a hef="http://www.trinitywallstreet.org/hist.html">Trinity 
              Church</a> in New York City. With that appointment, he had reached 
              the pinnacle of Anglican success in America. In 1749, he married 
              Mary Rutgers and settled in New York. Ever the student, in 1760, 
              Oxford University granted him the doctor of divinity degree.</P>
            <p>Reverend Barclay made his will in June 1764 - leaving his estate 
              to his wife and children. He died in August and was buried in the 
              <a href="#trinity">Trinity churchyard</a>.</p>
