<!-- Start Main Content -->
<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Jan Byvanck</strong></a> was born in Oldenzeel, Holland in 1634. By the 1650s, he had emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and was living in New York.

<p>In October 1666, he married Bortje/Belitie, the daughter of Evert Duyckinck of New York City.  By 1690, the marriage had produced a number of children. During the 1680s, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>After trading seasonally up the Hudson valley, by the 1670s, this Byvanck family had relocated to Albany where Jan continued to engage in business. He owned a house and lot on the hill and was included among the Albany householders in a census taken in <a href="../../census1679.html#7502">1679</a>. He also owned additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">acreage</a> (including gadens) in and around Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#7502">1681</a>, he was among the Albany people who petitioned the court regarding the fur trade.


<p>Perhaps he returned to New York to live some time during the 1680s. Jan Byvanck was dead by August 1704 as noted in a will involving the family of his widow.  </p>
