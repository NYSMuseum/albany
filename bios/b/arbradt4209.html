<P><a href="#sources"><b>Arent Bradt</b></a> was born in February 1745 and baptized at the Schenectady Dutch church. He was the son of Johannes and Anna Van Antwerpen Bradt of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</p>


<p>In March 1766, he married blacksmith's daughter <a href="../h/jahogan4324.html">Jannetje Hogan</a>. By 1785, eight children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>Arent Bradt was a cartman and wagonner who settled his family along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> above where it <a href="../../im/imepearlchurch.html">cut</a> across Pearl Street. For many decades he was a Fox Street <a href="../../census1790.html#4209">mainstay</a>. His address on the south side of the street - three lots above Chapel Street, was 20 Fox Street.</p>

<p>He supported the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-as.html">cause</a> by hauling loads of supplies to Lake George and New England. He also served as jail keeper in Albany in 1776. Although, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> before the war, he did not receive a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> for service in the War for Independence.</p>
 
<p>Arent Bradt continued to live at the Fox Street address. His name last appeared on community <a href="../../sources.html#ad">rolls</a> in 1818.</p>
