<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Bogardus</strong></a> was the son of New Netherland pioneers Domine <a href="evbogardus.html">Everardus Bogardus</a> and his wife, <a href="../j/anjans.html">Anneke Jans</a>. Perhaps he was born in September 1640 and christened at the Dutch church on Manhattan. He grew up in a large combined family in New Amsterdam. Following the death of his father <a href="../../res/ts.html">in</a> 1648, Anneke Jans took her children to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where she lived out the remainder of her life.

<p>This Cornelis Bogardus was a resident of Beverwyck where, in <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6362">1660</a>, his name was included on a list of Beverwyck area <a href="../../furtrade.html">traders</a>. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T9oTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22cornelis+bogardus%22&source=bl&ots=8r4lyL1KBO&sig=f2YjvEmMNZNnJgKIhj_AkKWCBRA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Tq5RUaidBLXj4AO8p4GAAg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20bogardus%22&f=false">owned</a> a house in the village and also is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_xK5wK-WwQEC&pg=PA280&lpg=PA280&dq=%22cornelis+bogardus%22&source=bl&ots=szFfH3Q-EJ&sig=wFuNWBFWBqxg2MiSvVF5Hzz6jEM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=zK9RUYzlGJbe4AO_gYHYCg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20bogardus%22&f=false">said</a> to have been a gun<a href="../../trades/metal.html">smith</a> and/or gunstockmaker.

<p>In January 1663, he was among the adult children acknowledged as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willanjans.html">will</a> filed by his legendary mother.

<p>He is <a href="http://www.conovergenealogy.com/famous-p/p801.htm#i40043">said</a> to have married <a href="../t/heteller6609.html">Helena Teller</a> in August 1664. Their short-lived union produced a namesake <a href="cobogardus6363.html">son</a>.

 
<p>However, Cornelis Bogardus was dead by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WBdCh9uazCQC&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=%22cornelis+bogardus%22&source=bl&ots=lEewJQa5nK&sig=w9QgJrbU-9iTWP4XsY4685Kct-I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=frvhUO39IM-O0QGnqYH4Bg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20bogardus%22&f=false">1666</a> when his house and estate were sold. An extensive <a href="#inv">inventory</a> of his personal effects and obligations chronicled his holdings. He had lived less than thirty years but left a substantial estate. His widow re-married and lived for many years.</p>
