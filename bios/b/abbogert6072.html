<P>This <a href="#sources">
<strong>Abraham Bogert</strong></a> was born in December 1723. He was the son of <a href="pibogert6070.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../f/refonda3770.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Bogert. He was called "Abraham P." or "Abraham Bogert, Jr." His father was a shoemaker who raised a large family in the third ward.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1746">1746</a>, Abraham P. was named constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a>, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1775">1775</a>, he was named firemaster for the second ward. On a number of occasions, his accounts were paid by the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a>.

<p>He was called a <a href="../../census1756.html#263">carpenter</a>, then a cooper, and later perhaps a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cordwainer</a> who also had a lot on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. His third ward holdings were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">valued</a> modestly on city assessment rolls. 

<p>In 1753, he married a woman named Maria Bassett. By 1765, three children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their family probably was larger as three of his children were buried in the church between 1757 and 1757.

<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-be.html">war</a>, he would have been in his fifties and does not seem to have played an active part - except to sign <a href="../../guide/histres.html#pet">petitions</a> and post bail.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6072">1790</a>, his second ward household included his wife and one slave.  


<p>Abraham P. Bogert died during the 1790s. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate on April 7, 1796. </p>
