<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac Bogert</b></a> was born in January 1695. He was a younger son in the large family of Albany natives <a href="jacbogert6052.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../q/janq2136.html">Jannetje Quackenbush</a> Bogert. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of a middling builder and was destined to follow his father in the 
<a  href="../../trades/wood.html">wood trades</a> although not initially in an Albany setting.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6066">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders - probably still based in his long-lived parents' home.

<p>In November 1725, he married <a href="../o/heoo435.html">Hendrickie Oothout</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced seven children by 1741. However,  church burial records reveal that only two lived to adulthood.</p>

<p>Isaac was known as a carpenter in Albany and in outposts as far away as <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> - perhaps explaining why he did not marry until he had passed his thirtieth         birthday. Over a long career, he performed contract carpentry work for several governmental jurisdictions.

<p>After <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6066">coming of age</a> in his father's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north end</a> home, these Bogerts became first ward <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6066">mainstays</a>. Upwardly mobile, Isaac was elected <a href="../../corporation.html"> assistant alderman</a> three times beginning in 1736. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6066">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.</p>

<p>Hendrickie Oothout Bogert died in April of 1764. A few years later, Isaac's modest first ward home was noted on city assessment rolls - with his adult son, <a href="hebogert6097.html">Hendrick</a>, having emerged as the head of their branch of the <a href="bogert.html">family</a>. Isaac Bogert also may have kept a still <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">just outside</a> the city borders near the property of his <a href="../q/q.html">Quackenbush</a> kinfolk. Perhaps his <a href="../../wills/willvodouw2233.html">partner</a> in the still was <a href="../d/vodouw2233.html">Volkert A. Douw</a>.</p>

<p>Isaac Bogert died in September 1770 at the age of seventy-five. This one-time tradesman <a href="bogert.html#pol">led</a> the family onto the city council. His sons and their offspring built on that success to elevate the Bogerts again.</p>
