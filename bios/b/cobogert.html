<P>According to <a href="https://archive.org/stream/genealogicalnote00talc#page/n37/mode/2up/search/bogert">family-based</a> resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Corn. Bogert</strong></a> was born in South Holland (more precisely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schoonrewoerd">Schoenderwoert</a>) during the late 1630s [?]. He was the son of Cornelis Teunisse and <a href="../../res/sp.html">B</a>eeltje Corn. He appears to have been the first Bogert to live in the <a href="../../beverwyck.html">community</a> that became Albany. We have referred to him as "Cornelis Corn. <a href="../../res/sp.html">Bo</a>gert" to mitigate confusion with other same-named individuals (particularly <a href="cobogardus6362.html">Cornelis Bogardus</a>).

<p>His wife was <a href="../../res/sp.html">na</a>med Dirckje and may have been a <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=pete%5Fwitze&id=I21483">daughter</a> of the Coeymans family. Their marriage (<a href="../../res/guess.html">prob</a>ably during the 1650s) produced at least five children who subsequently married - all probably <a href="../../drc.html#sources">born</a> prior to 1683. 

<p>He is thought to have emigrated to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck by 1641 when he leased land in the manor. In April 1661, he leased a house and lot from Jan Barentsen Wemp. In July he was involved in a contract with Barent Van M___ for a house and lot in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> but that sale appears to have been incomplete.

<p>In September 1661, he purchased a quarter interest in his recently deceased father's farm in Schoenderwort, Holland from his brother.  

<p>Cornelis Corn. Bogert is said to have died in July 1665. "Cornelius van de Bogert" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA4&lpg=PA4&dq=%22cornelius+van+de+bogert%22&source=bl&ots=jx1QXvn4jV&sig=w5mHSrfD-yXKCqLTaPSVPI_aHeA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l1ADVL26FdKWgwTj44D4Bg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22cornelius%20van%20de%20bogert%22&f=false">buried</a> "at our expense" from the Dutch church on July 28.  Perhaps his widow re-married.</p>
