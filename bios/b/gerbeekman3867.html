      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerardus Beekman</strong></a> was born during 
        the 1730s. He seems to have been the son of Jacob and Maria Beekman of 
        New York. 
      <p>In June 1761, he married twenty-nine-year-old <a href="../d/andouw2060.html">Anna 
        Douw</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that 
        time, he was identified as "of N.Y." By 1775, six children had been christened 
        in the Albany church where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor. 
      <p>By the mid-1760s, these Beekmans had settled into a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> that was valued substantially on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. 
      <p>In 1767, the thirty-ish Gerardus (or a same-named and younger relative) 
        was a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. Otherwise, his name was not <a href="../../inprog.html">found</a> 
        on city <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">service rolls</a>. In 1772, his 
        account was paid from the city treasury. 
      <p>Gerardus Beekman was a <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">sl</a>aveholder. 
        In 1774, his slave, Anthony Sweezer, was made a communicant at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a>. In 1801, he freed Tom Townsides, a twenty-eight-year-old 
        man. 
      <p>In March 1776, he was <a href="../../coc.html">identified</a> as a merchant 
        in Albany. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, assessment 
        rolls showed that Evert Bancker was a resident in his house. 
      <p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he contributed to the 
        cause, performed some domestic services, signed community-based petitions, 
        and was in trouble with the revolutionaries for raising prices. However, 
        afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3867">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>In 1784, his store "nearly opposite <a href="../d/whdoug7884.html">Wheeler 
        Douglass</a>'s" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7#PPA195,M1">advertized</a> 
        in the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3867">1788</a>, 
        his first ward house and lot were valued on the city assessment roll. 
        In that year, he <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#3867">owed the 
        estate</a> of Dr. Henry Van Dyck twelve pounds. However, after that, his 
        name was absent from Albany rolls. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> or 1800, his name was not 
        found among the heads of households in New York State. Perhaps, he became 
        debilitated and/or had moved in with a member of the Beekman or Douw family 
        such as his wife's widowed, younger <a href="../d/eldouw2077.html">sister</a> 
        - who was both! 
      <p>Gerardus Beekman died in January 1807 and was buried from his church. 
        His son, <a href="pedbeekman3926.html">Peter Douw Beekman</a>, became 
        a prominent Albany resident. </p>
