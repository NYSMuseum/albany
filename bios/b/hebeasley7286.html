<strong>Henry Beasley</strong></a> was born in June 1724. He was the son of schoolteacher <a href="jobeasley7287.html">John Beasley</a> and his wife, the widow <a href="../d/lydealy5402.html">Lydia Dealy</a> Van Benthuysen Beasley. He grew up in the midst of an Anglo-ancestry enclave located on Albany's <a href="jobeasley7287.html#southside">Southside</a>. 

<p>Probably in his late twenties, he married Mary Noble. Between, 1753 and 1761, the marriage produced five children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> where he was a member and church warden.

<p>He was a shoemaker <a href="../../makers.html#leather">and</a> cordwainer whose <a href="../../census1756.html#88">home</a> was in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> valued his holdings modestly.

<p>He was identified with an English-ancestry part of the community that revolved around the tavern of his brother-in-law, <a href="../c/ricartwright6508.html">Richard Cartwright</a>. He was a member of the "Masters" <a href="../../org/masonic.html#masters">Masonic lodge</a> and of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>His father apparently left Albany during the 1750s. Henry was granted Letters of Administration on John Beasley's estate in 1768.

<p>By the 1770s, he appeared to be a mainline Albany resident. In 1770, he served on the Albany watch. In 1774 and 1775, he was identified as city tax collector.

<p>Fifty years old at the outbreak of hostilities, he managed to avoid the action and his holdings appeared to have survived intact. He also was granted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7286">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In March 1783, still known as a cordwainer, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willgeewendell2872.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor. 

<p>An assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7286">1788</a>, noted his personal property.

<p>At some time prior to 1790, he appears to have left Albany. Henry Beasley died in Upper Canada in 1793. His children raised families at Niagara and in Canada.</p>
