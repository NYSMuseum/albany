<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Mary Burk</strong></a> probably was born during the 1730s. We seek information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In September 1758, she married <a href="../m/wmmcew.html">William Mc Cew</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as "of Albany." No information on children has been found in the available records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>"<a href="../../res/sp.html">Mc Cue</a>" was a newcomer tailor who <a href"../../res/guess.html">seems</a> to have settled in Albany during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. During the 1760s, his third ward <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">holdings</a> were valued moderately.  

<p>However, In September 1763, Mc Cew posted a <a href="http://www.history.umd.edu/Faculty/CLyons/Hist%20210%20New%20York%20Run%20Away%20Wife%20Ads.pdf">notice</a> in the <i>New York Mercury</i> stating that "Whereas, Mary McCew, has eloped from her bed and board, and had taken with her cash and goods to a considerable value; these are to desire all persons whatsoever not to credit the said Mary on my account, as I will pay no debts she shall or may contract from the date here of." 

<p>But Mary (or another Mary) seems to have been living with him in September 1771 when a now "sickly" Mc Cew filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmmcew.html">will</a> naming her as executor and principal heir. Mc Cew was dead by September 24 when the will passed probate.

<p>Mc Cew's bequest to his widow included the "time" of an apprentice, a journeyman, and "the little girl Jenny," whom he instructed Mary to "bring her up as a child ought to be."

<p>In December 1771, "a young man at Mr. Mac Cew's" was listed among the <a href="../../coerec1771.html#4394">members</a> of St. Peter's Anglican church.

<p>Beginning in 1772, Widow Mc Cew was advertizing in the <i><a href="../../ag.html">Albany Gazette</a></i> that she was "carrying on the tailoring business" and that she had "engaged proper hands for that purpose. In October 1773, the city council <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=%22cews&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22cews&f=false">noted</a> that the widow had a house and that she "takes in boarders" - formerly including tailor <a href="../g/pagah.html">Patrick Gahagan</a>.

<p>After that, her name has not been found in the community-based record. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Mary Burk Mc Cew. </p>
