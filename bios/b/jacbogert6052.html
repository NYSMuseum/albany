<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Cornelise Bogert</b></a> was born in 1654. He was the son of New Netherland pioneers Cornelis and Dirckie Bogert. He was sometimes referred to as Jacob "Voss!"</p>

<p>By 1679, he had married <a href="../q/janq2136.html">Jannetje Quackenbush</a> and had settled into an Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#6052">home</a>. By 1698, the marriage had produced eight children who further established the <a href="bogert.html">Bogert family</a> in Albany and its hinterland. Jacob Cornelisse was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 


<p>Jacob Cornelisse or "Voss" was an Albany mainstay who lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1697.html#050">1697</a>, his household included seven children. Two years later, he signed an <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6052">oath</a> pledging allegiance to the King of England. In 1720, his name appeared on a list of Albany <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6052">freeholders</a>. He served the community as a juror and firemaster. His holdings were accorded a moderate assessment in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6052">1709</a>.</p>

<p>Jacob Cornelise Bogert died in April 1725. His widow survived until 1734</p>
