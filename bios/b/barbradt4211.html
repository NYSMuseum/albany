<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Barbara Bradt</strong></a> was born in May 1731. She was the daughter of <a href="barbradt4212.html">Barent</a> and <a href="../m/elmarselis697.html">Elizabeth Marselis</a> Bradt.
 
<p>Days from her twenty-second birthday, in May 1753 she became the wife of Albany businessman <a href="../w/hawendell2672.html">Harmanus J. Wendell</a>. By 1776, the marriage had produced nine children all of whom were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>These Wendells made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Harmanus was a prominent businessman and local official. Harmanus Wendell died in June 1786. Aided by as many as five <a href="../../census1790.html#4211">slaves</a>, the fifty-five-year-old widow took over management of their <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4211">property</a> which included her <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">residence</a> on Market Street and other houses on Maiden Lane and Fox Street. These were valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1788tl">assessment rolls</a> as late as 1809.. 

<p>Barbara Bradt Wendell died in April 1812 at age eighty-one.
