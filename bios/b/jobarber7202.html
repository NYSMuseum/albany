<P>According to  <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=%22robert+barber%22+albany&source=bl&ots=2hKxIX_y9A&sig=6X-31IfP-R4qVBCWtec4uZxs8DY&hl=en&ei=4zC9SbasB6GxtwebhJz6Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA33,M1">sources</a>, <a href="#sources"><strong>John Barber</strong></a> was born in Langford, Ireland in 1758. With his younger brother, <a href="robarber.html">Robert</a>, he emigrated to America and arrived in Albany during the 1780s.

<p>John is said to have been a school teacher while Robert trained under Charles R. Webster and became a printer. In 1788, "Robert Barber & Co." started the <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3csoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=%22albany+register%22+barber&source=bl&ots=RL3GaHygsa&sig=QuWx0NWKThuLtUIX1VMo61ZoH50&hl=en&ei=2X2-SaPPBYmMtgf44en4Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result">Albany Register</a></i> - a political newspaper formed to oppose ratification of the Federal Constitution. Before long, Robert Barber left the paper and moved to Johnstown. Although not really a printer himself, John assumed ownership and operation of the newspaper.


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7202">1788</a>, the personal property of the Barber brothers was valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> assessment roll within another household. Two years later in <a href="../../census1790.html#7202">1790</a>, John Barber was identified as the head of household that counted a total of five members. By <a href="../../census1800.html#7202">1800</a>, the Barber residence had grown to twelve members and included the budding family of his sister and brother-in-law, <a href="../s/sosouthwick.html">Solomon Southwick</a>.

<p>In 1791, John Barber <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL15453708M">printed</a> an updated version of the <i><a href="../../doc/laws.html">Laws</a> and Ordinances</i> of the city of Albany  from his shop at No. 4 <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a>.


<p> In 1793, he was among the founders and the first secretery of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In 1792, he was joined at the newspaper by the journeyman printer <a href="../s/sosouthwick.html">Solomon Southwick</a> who married sister Jane Barber and took over the <i>Register</i> following Barber's death. 

<p>John Barber died in July 1808 and was buried with his brother in a simple grave in the Episcopal plot. His newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA18,M1">obituary</a> noted that he was "publisher of the <i>Albany Register</i>, died of consumption, aged 50. He was printer to the state, and a man very highly respected for his moral and social worth. Before he took charge of the <i>Register</i>, he had been a school teacher under Mr. Merchant."  His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in July. 

<p>His younger brother, Robert, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=%22robert+barber%22+albany&source=bl&ots=2hKxIX_y9A&sig=6X-31IfP-R4qVBCWtec4uZxs8DY&hl=en&ei=4zC9SbasB6GxtwebhJz6Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA33,M1">died</a> in 1812 at the age of forty-two. He was buried with his brother in a simple grave in the Episcopal plot.

<p>The business account book of Albany artist <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra Ames</a> for 1809, noted a <a href="http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!217597!0#focus">portrait</a> of "Mr. Barber" commissioned by Solomon Southwick - Barber's brother-in-law.  </p>

This outline <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We are puzzled by the lack of family-based information uncovered so far.
