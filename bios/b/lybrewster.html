<P>According to <a href=http://archive.org/stream/brewstergenealog190801jone/brewstergenealog190801jone_djvu.txt"">fam</a>ily-based resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Lydia Brewster</strong></a> was born in September 1762. Thus, she would have been the daughter of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=heitman+officers&printsec=frontcover&source#v=onepage&q=elisha+brewster&f=false">Rev</a>olutionary war veteran "Capt." Elisha and Lucy (Yeomans) Brewster of Middletown, Connecticut where they resided for the rest of their lives. Her mother died in 1775 but her father survived until 1789. We seek more definitive information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, courtship, and path to Albany.

<p>In July 1786, she married Albany native <a href="../vd/pevdu.html">Peter Van Deusen</a> in  <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/3719/GPC_EARLYCTMARRIAGES-0839/54138?backurl=&ssrc=&backlabel=Return">Middletown</a>. By 1805, at least five children were christened in New York and at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#pevdu">1790</a>, these Van Deusens were living in Albany and on the <a href="../../im\immktstcol.html">west side</a> of Market Street. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#pevdu">later</a>, their <a href="../../wards.html">third ward</a> household at that location consisted of eight people. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, that property was assessed modestly. 

<p>Peter Van Deusen died in Albany in April 1809.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22van+deusen%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22van%20deusen%22&f=false">1813</a>, the name of  "widow Lydia Van Deusen" appeared in the first city directory as the principal resident at 60 Fox Street - where she lived for several years. 

<p>Lydia Brewster Van Deusen died in April 1832 and was buried in the Dutch church plot. Her death notice appeared in the Albany newspaper. This Albany wife and widow had lived for seventy years.</p>
