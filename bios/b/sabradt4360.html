<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sara Bradt</strong></a> was born about 1679. She was the daughter of <a href="baalbradt4182.html">Barent</a> and <a href="../d/susdircks4368.html">Susanna Dircks</a> Bradt. She was a younger daughter in the large family of a Norwegian ancestry New Netherland pioneer who became an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#078">mainstay</a> and lived in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">N</a>orth End of the city.

<p>In September 1699, Sara married <a href="../vi/ryvi2477.html">Rynier Myndertse</a> (Van Iveren) at the Albany <a rhef="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1717, nine of their children had been christened in the church where she became a member in 1696.

<p>These Van Iverens raised their large family in a comfortable home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Rynier was known as an Albany mainstay although he may have spent time in the Indian country pursuing some aspect of the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. 

<p>Sara Bradt Van Iveren died in February 1756 and was buried from the church. Her husband survived for another two years. Her eldest <a href="../vi/myvi2466.html">son</a> probably lived with or near his parents and may have followed his father in the <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith's trade</a>. </p>
