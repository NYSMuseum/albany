<P><A href="#biography"><B>Johannes Beekman</B></A> was born in 1733. He was the last of the six children born to Albany blacksmith/businessman <a href="jabeekman3890.html">Jacob Beekman</a> and his wife, <a href="../h/dehansen4947.html">Debora Hansen</a> Beekman. </P>

          <P>In 1759, he married Schenectady native <a href="../s/masanders1436.html">Maria 
            Sanders</a>. The couple settled in Albany where six of their seven 
            children were <a href="#baptized">baptized</a> in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a>. As the only surviving son, Johannes was able to raise 
            their family in his father's house on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
            Street</a> where he too became a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> 
            mainstay. </P>

<p>From his Pearl Street base, <a href="#name">this</a> Johannes Beekman became a successful merchant and landholder. He was identified with the wealthiest Albany householders on city assessment rolls from the mid-1760s.</p> 

<p>He entered public service in 1756 when he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In 1763, he was elected assistant alderman in the second ward. After serving for several years, he was elected alderman in September 1775. A seat on the city council identified him as a <a href="../../cityfathers.html">leading member</a> of the Albany business community. At the same time, he served in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In 1768, he was identified as a lieutenant.</p>


          <p>Early in the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">conflict</a>, the forty-two-year-old 
            Beekman joined the crusade for American liberties - risking property 
            and position in the process. Early in 1776, he <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">signed</a> the "General Association." He represented the second ward as an 
            active and dedicated member of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
            of Correspondence</a> during most of its life. When the city's <a href="../../corporation.html">municipal 
            government</a> resumed operations in 1778, he again was chosen second 
            ward alderman and served for several years.</p> 

<p>John J. Beekman's public career transcended the local level when he was elected to represent Albany in the New York State Assembly in 1781 and 1782. During that time he was active in Indian diplomacy. He was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html#3866">mayor</a> of Albany in June 1783. His mayoralty paralleled the end of the war as Beekman served until October 1786.</p>

          <p>Following his tenure at city hall, Beekman settled into the home at what became 
            <a href="#52">52</a> North Pearl Street - managing his assets and 
            raising his family following the death of his wife in 1794. His household 
            was attended by <a href="../../census1790.html#3866">four slaves</a>. 
            During that time, he also was involved in a number of civic initiatives 
            including the construction of the <a href="../../images/jpg/enpearlchurch.jpg">new 
            Dutch church</a> then taking shape beyond his Pearl Street home.
			
<p>In August 1797, his storehouse and stable on Middle Lane were destroyed by <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#middle">fire</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#3866">1800</a>, the census configured the second ward home of simply "John Beeckman" without his deceased wife and with five slaves.			</p>

<p>Six months short of his seventieth birthday, Mayor John James Beekman died in December 1802. He was buried from the church where he was a lifelong member.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Johannes Jas. <a href="beekman.html">Beekman</a></B> is 
            CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 3866. This profile is derived 
            chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. 
            <a name=name></a> He sometimes was referred to as "John James Beekman." 
            The use of the middle name (typically carried a leter or two beyond 
            the middle initial "<a href="jojabeekman3866.html">J</a>") prevented 
            confusion with contemporary kin John M. and John H. Beekman. However, 
            not all historical recorders always used the initials. For example, 
            three different Albany householders were listed as "John Bateman" 
            (Beekman) on the <a href="../../census1756.html"> census of 1756</a>!</p>

<p><a name=baptized></a>The first child was baptized in Schenectady in 1761. the others were christened in the Albany church between 1763 and 1781. Perhaps the newlyweds lived for a time with Maria's family. By 1763, however, Johannes Ja. Beekman was a member of the Albany city council.</p>

<p><a name=52></a>In 1815, his son, John Sanders Beekman, was living at <b>52 North Pearl Street</b>.</p>
