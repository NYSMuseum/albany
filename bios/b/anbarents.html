<P><A href="#sources"><B>Anna Barents Bradt</B></A> was the matriarch of the Albany <a href="../../bios/b/bradt.html">Bradt family</a>.</p>

<p>A native of Oedenbroek (Altenbruch, Germany), she married 
<a href="../../bios/b/albanbradt4180.html">Albert Andriesse Bradt</a> in Amsterdam in 1632. Like her new husband, she was twenty-four years old. Her mother, Gisseltie Baerens, was present at the wedding - and later joined her in New Netherland.</p>

      <p>Pregnant with her third child, she emigrated to America with her husband 
        in 1636. Following the birth of her son named <a href="../../bios/vd/svdz.html">Storm</a> 
        during the crossing, the family took up residence inthe colony of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        along the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Normanskill</a>. There, she 
        raised a family that ultimately included eight children.</P>


<p>Anna Barents Bradt died during the winter of 1661. She lived roughly fifty-four years. Albert Andriesse remarried. But Anna was the mother of the Bradt children who established the family in Albany and the region!</p>
