      <P>According to <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible13.htm">family 
        records</a>, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dirck Bensing</strong></a> was 
        born in November 1649. He was the eldest son of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
        pioneers <a href="dibensing7319.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="cabercx7334.html">Catharina 
        Bercx</a> Bensing. His father died before his tenth birthday. His mother 
        re-married and raised a second family. 
      <p>In May 1663, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willhahun.html">joint 
        will</a> filed by his mother and new <a href="../h/hthun4772.html">husband</a>. 
        At that time, Dirck was aged thirteen. 
      <p>Initially, he seems to have been a resident of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        where his first two children were christened. His first wife was Tryntje. 
        Their last three children were baptized in New York. In November 1707, 
        he married Jannetje Van de Water. 
      <p>This Dirck Bensing was called the master of the boat <i>Unity</i> in 
        1692. He was named on an Albany assessment roll in the third ward in <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#7320">1689</a>. 
        In 1700, he was called on to appraise some Albany property. He also was 
        a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
      <p>In June 1717, his New York City estate was appraised. It included pictures 
        and portraits, two slaves, and silver implements. It also included monies 
        and debts owed him. By that time, this Dirck <a href="../../res/sp.html">B</a>ensing 
        was dead.</p>
