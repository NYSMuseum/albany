<P>Family-based resources hold that <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sara Bergen</strong></a> was born in 1721. She was said to have been the daughter of Johannes and Sara Bergen of Flatbush, <a href="https://archive.org/details/bergenfamilyorde00inberg">Brooklyn</a>. A number of same-named contemporaries are at risk dictating <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">caution</a> in moving forward with her story. At this time, we do not believe that she was closely connected to the Hudson Valley and Albany <a href="../vb/vbergen.html">Van Bergens</a>.

<p>In November 1746, she became a member of the Reformed church of New York "on certificate from Brooklyn." 

<p>In September 1750, a marriage license was granted to <a href="../w/jojwendell2951.html">Johannes Wendell</a> and Sara Bergen and they were <a href="https://archive.org/stream/recordsofreforme01coll#page/n393/mode/2up">married</a> in New York that same month. However, beginning in June 1751, four children were christened to those parents in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Sara Bergen Wendell had become the wife of a mainline Albany tradesman and resident of the first ward. Two decades later, her <a href="../w/jojwendell2951.html">husband</a> seems to have served the American cause on the Albany <a href="../../or/or-as.html">homefront</a>.

<p>However, following the baptism of their last child in 1758, we have not yet encountered discernible references to Sara Bergen Wendell in the community-based record. Nor have we found additional materials following our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a>-based resources.

<p>Missing any balance of her adult life and passing, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany wife Sara Bergen Wendell. </p>
