<P>The first ward household of <a href="#sources"> <strong>Andrew Brown</strong></a> was configured on the Albany <a href="#1800">cen</a>sus in <a href="../../census1800.html#7448">1800</a>. A year earlier his <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">substantial house</a> (perhaps identified as "Andrew Brown & Co." and valued at $14,000), lots, and personal property were valued on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment roll</a>. The census reveals that this Albany resident was born between 1756 and 1774, that he lived with a woman in his age bracket, and was the head of a household that included five younger people. 

<p>Later information surrounding the formation of the St. Andrew's Society, identified him as a native Scot. We seek more specific defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. An older, same-named <a href="http://albanyhilltowns.com/wikiBio/index.php?title=Brown,_Andrew">contemporary</a> (perhaps one of four living in New York State in 1790) also <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=21743301">died</a> in western Albany County.

<p>In May 1801, the newspaper reported that "Andrew Brown & Co." was offering for sale a substantial property at the corner of State and Market Streets. These offerings were described in detail in the <a href="../../doc/nn3.html#brown">contemporary press</a>.

<p>Perhaps his wife was <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Jane/Jean Maxwell.  If so, the <a href="http://www.doig.net/PAUL1713.html">marriage</a> produced a number of likely children who would marry and raise children during the nineteenth century.
 
<p>During the early 1800s, this individual was a member and trustee (1804-07) of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. His wife, Jane, was a member beginning in September 1803. In October 1803, he was elected second vice-president at the first public meeting of the <a href="../../org/standsoc.html">St. Andrew's Society</a> - a community-based group that contributed "to the relief of Scottish emigrants." In February <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=GpUPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22andrew+brown%22&source=bl&ots=EJhZb6y1zY&sig=2VqgX6TuzYlsqll5iGbNsZmVfsc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihpdXIpInMAhXDPD4KHT41CKoQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20brown%22&f=false"">1802</a>, he had been named president as the first president "sould be a Scotsman." 

<p>A reminiscent cityscape attributed to <a href="../staff/historians.html">hist</a>orical artist <a href="../e/jaeights2036.html">James Eights</a> features his <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">landmark</a> home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">North Market Street</a> during the early 1800s. 

<p>Andrew Brown had passed on by March 1807 when letters of administration were issued on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a>.

<p><a href="../qqqq.html">Missing</a> important defining information, and following our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based</a> sources, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>

<p><a name=1800></a>In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, eleven city households were headed by men with the Brown surname - more than double the number enumerated in 1790. By the way, fifteen Brown-named addresses were listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> published in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA958dq=%22brown+allen%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=brown+allen&f=false">1813</a>. Kinship relationships have not been determined at this time. Five individuals named "Andrew Brown" headed households in New York State (<a href="https://archive.org/stream/browngenealogyof00brow/browngenealogyof00brow_djvu.txt">one</a> in Rensselaerville, Albany County) and were  configured on the first Federal Census of 1790.
