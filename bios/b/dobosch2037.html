<P><a href="#sources"><b>Dorothy Bosch</b></a> was <a href="http://www.altlaw.com/edball/dutchbap.htm#1661">baptized</a> at the New Amsterdam Dutch church in May 1661. She was the daughter of  <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/historical/southernnewyork/s_ny_48.htm">Hendrick Alberts</a> and his second wife Maria Gerrits Bosch. She was left but one shilling in the will of her father who characterized her as "a stubborn and disobedient daughter for many years." </p>


<p>By the 1680s, she had married <a href="../h/ichallenbeck5215.html">Isaac Casperse Hallenbeck</a> of Albany. By 1706, more than seven of her children had been baptized in the Albany Dutch church.</p>

<p>These Hallenbecks lived on Albany's south side where their home commanded an extensive tract of land that stretched all the way to the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. 

<p>In 1708, Dorothy Bosch Hallenbeck was named administrator of Isaac Casperse's estate. She outlived her husband by almost twenty-five years -  probably passing most of her widowhood in the Albany household of one of her <a href="../h/hehallenbeck5274.html">children</a>. She died in February 1744 and was buried in the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> yard.</p>
