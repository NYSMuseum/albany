<strong>Dirck Albertse Bradt</strong></a> was born during the 1640s. He was the youngest son in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="albanbradt4180.html">Albert Andriesse</a> and <a href="anbarents.html">Anna Barents</a> Bradt. He grew up on his father's farm and mill on the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#nmskl">Normanskill</a> and at Albert Andriesse's house in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>/Albany.


<p>He seems to not have married but was identified as a householder in Albany in <a href="../../census1679.html#4343">1679</a> and participated in <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> and other transactions with his father and other <a href="../../econ/famec.html#sinad">family</a> members. In <a href="../../lists/list1681.html">1681</a>, he joined with oher Albany burghers in petitioning the court regarding the Indian trade. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#4343">1684</a>, his Albany taxes were in arrears.

<p>By the early 1680s, Dirck Albertse's aging and irascible father came to live in his Albany home. Dirck Albertse occasionally appeared before the Albany court. But, following the death of his father in 1686, his life in the community's record is best described as marginal.

<p>Dirck Albertse Bradt died sometime after 1702 when he was elected constable for <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canastigione</a>.</p>
