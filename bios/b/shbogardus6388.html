<strong>Shibboleth Bogardus, Jr.</strong></a> was born in 1720 and baptized in Albany on October 2. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="shbogardus6387.html">Shibboleth</a> and <a href="../d/andgarmo783.html">Anna De Garmo</a> Bogardus. His father died in 1747 and, for a time, he seems to have lived with his mother.


<p>In November 1750, he married <a href="../vd/cavdwerken.html">Catharina Elizabeth Vanderwerken</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1756, three children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In 1756, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus.html">will</a> filed by his brother.

<p>In 1744, he was elected constable for the second ward - perhaps while still in the home of his widowed mother. Following his marriage, he lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>  - near the Albany waterfront. The assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a> placed a modest value on his home. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6388">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>In June 1785, he petitioned the city council to make a pier from the middle dock to the street - from his home to that of <a href="anebradt4204.html">Anthony E. Bradt</a>. The name of Shibboleth Bogardus, Jr. has not been encountered in the community <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a> beyond that date.</p>
