<P><A href="#biography"><B>Catherine Brooks</B></A> was born in Albany in August 1749. She was the youngest of the three daughters of city residents Jonathan and Rebecca Tatten Brooks. Her parents settled on the "Southside" - the home of many Albany <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a>.</P>

          <P>In June 1770, she married recently arrived sailmaker <a href="../e/abeights7800.html">Abraham 
            Eights</a> at Albany's <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's Church</a>. 
            Over the next twenty-two years, that marriage produced eleven children 
            who were baptized in three Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.</P>

<p><img src="../../images/eights1822ad.jpg" border=1 width=250 alt="Eights households in 1822" hspace=5 vspace=1 align=left>Catherine made her home in a house her husband recently had built on the Albany waterfront. Over the next half century, Catherine Eights raised her large family in the modest house at what became <a href="../../streets.html#dock">28 Dock Street</a> - next to the Eights sail yard. This <a href="../../makers.html">production-class</a> family was relatively affluent - owning several parcels of land and having several <a href="../../census1790.html#7800">slaves</a> to help out in the home and shop.</p>

          <p>Catherine's <a href="../e/joeights7933.html">son</a> and <a href="../e/jaeights2036.html">grandson</a> 
            further distinguished the Eights name in nineteenth-century Albany. 
            Patriarch Abraham Eights died in 1820. His will left Catherine real 
            and personal property during her widowhood. Widow Catherine Eights 
            died in 1829 at age eighty.</p>
