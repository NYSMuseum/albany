<P>At least three individuals named <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Brown</strong></a> lived in and around Albany during the second half of the eighteenth century. This sketch focuses on the city resident who died in February 1799 at the age of 66.

<p>Perhaps he married Margaret Scott (other maiden names possible) in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on January 1, 1777. Church records tell us that the marriage was <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part6.html">certified</a> by Col. P Gansevoort and that the partners were "of the army."  Daughter Margaret was christened to "John Brown and Marg. Wilson" in the church in January 1778.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jobr">1779</a>, John Brown was identified as the owner of real and personal property in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. The assessment levied in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October</a> also included the Albany holdings of John Brown.

<p>At-risk for service or other involvement <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">during the War years</a>, men named "John Brown" have been connected to a number of regional activities. We maintain a cautious approach to assigning available qualitative information to this subject.

  

<p>However, by <a href="../../census1790.html#jobr">1790</a>, the only regional John Brown was listed on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>Perhaps this individual was the John Brown who was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">identified</a> as the city watchman in 1794 and '95.

      <p>John Brown died in February 1799 and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
        plot. His will passed probate on February 19, 1799. Many years later, his <a href="http://newyorkgravestones.org/view.php?id=56150">stone</a> was removed to Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
