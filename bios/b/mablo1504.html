<strong>Maas Bloomendal</strong></a> was born in May 1719. He was the son of <a  href="joblo1480.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../f/refonda.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Maas. He grew up in a brazier's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. By 1761, he was known as "Maus Bloomendall" when he was made co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willcoblo1464.html">estate</a> of his uncle.

<p>His wife was Catharina Steenburg. By 1769, the last two of at least eight children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a> and '62, he served as firemaster in the third ward. During the 1760s, his name appeared on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">tax</a> rolls for property in the third ward.

<p>[ <font size=-1><i>At this point, we understand that we are missing a central portion of his life. &nbsp; <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="Sorry about this!"></a> &nbsp; He may have been out of Albany during the 1770s. Perhaps they were living on or beyond the far reaches of greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. The Steenburghs (perhaps Starenburg) may have been living in Schoharie during that time.</i></font size> ]


<p>Maas Bloomendal made out his will in June 1786. He called himself a farmer of the East district of the Manor of Rensselaerswyck. It named his wife, three sons, and five daughters as heirs to receive his farm, land, and implements and his lot on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> in Albany. The will passed probate April 1790.</p>
