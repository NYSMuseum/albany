<strong>Jacob Bogert</strong></a> was born in July 1716. He was the son of <a href="pibogert6070.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../f/refonda3770.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Bogert. He grew up in a shoemaker's home in the third ward. Sometimes, he was known as "Jacob Bogert, Jr." to prevent confusion with an <a href="jabogert6054.html">older uncle</a>.

<p>In October 1741, he married <a href="../y/mayates4424.html">Maria Yates</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1763, their eleven children had been christened in Albany where both parents were members and his wife and daughter were pewholders.

<p>These Bogerts also lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Jacob was a <a href="../../census1756.html#302">carpenter</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6108">freeholder</a>.  In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1739">1739</a>, he was appointed constable. On several occasions, his accounts for services were paid by the city.

<p>Beginning in January <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22jacob+boghaert%22+volume+9&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q&f=false">1738</a>, a "Jacob Boghaert" petitioned the city council to buy a piece of unimproved land along the north side of Foxes Creek. That initiative is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22jacob+boghaert%22&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q&f=false">chronicled</a> in the city records. However, with his uncle possibly still alive, we are cautious in assigning this information.

<p>Perhaps he was the individual named "Jacob Bogard" whose <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West Manor</a> property was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">valued</a> in 1766 and 1767 and who was a member of a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a> in the latter year.

<p>Jacob Bogert was last heard from in 1774 when the city government paid his account.
