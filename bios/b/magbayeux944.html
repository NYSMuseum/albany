<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Magdalena Bayeux</strong></a> was born in July 1706. She was the daughter of Thomas and Magdalene Boudinot Bayeux. Her <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BakNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=%22thomas+bayeux%22&source=bl&ots=d2IEWkqZER&sig=333Jh2pAQvZB1jiXFUGVoz_YUh4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yKzdUNq0H-W40gHjmoDoDQ&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20bayeux%22&f=false">father</a> was a prominent businessman and a pillar of the New York City <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> community.

<p>In June 1726, Magdalena married Albany native <a href="../h/edholland.html">Edward Holland</a>. By 1732, the marriage had produced two daughters and possibly other children as well. Her older <a href="susbayeux.html">sister</a> married a son of the Albany Schuyler family. 



<p>These Hollands made their home on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. A prominent businessman and civic leader, Edward was appointed mayor of Albany in 1732. He served for seven years. However, Magdalena died before the end of his tenure.

<p>Thirty-one-year-old Magdalena Bayeux Holland was buried in the "English church" on March 26, 1737. In 1739, Holland re-married, moved his family to New York, and lived for another two decades. In December 1741, her father <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UVQOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=%22thomas+bayeux%22&source=bl&ots=bRwM03c0Jw&sig=guJt_6UMMFgI7Af2yObixA0nSr8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2avdUJKCGsTG0AHavoHYCA&ved=0CHMQ6AEwDzgK#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20bayeux%22&f=false">left</a> a share of his substantial estate to the children of his departed Magdalena.</p>
