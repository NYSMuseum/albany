<P><A href="#sources"><B>Arent Andriesse Bradt</B></A> probably was born before 1620 in Fredrikstad, Norway. He probably came to America with his older brother 
<a href="../../bios/b/albanbradt4180.html">Albert Andriesse</a> in 1637.</p>

      <p>Arent settled in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        with his brother's family on the Normanskill where he worked for Albert 
        Andriesse as a tobacco planter. After a decade, he ran his own sawmill, 
        perhaps did some <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a>, and may have 
        kept a tavern. He spent time at the downriver settlement of Esopus (where 
        one of his children was born), and travelled to Manhattan and Long Island 
        on business.</P>

<P>During the late 1640s, he married <a href="../d/cadvos7854.html">Catalina De Vos</a> of Rensselaerswyck. The last of their six children was born in 1661.</P>

<p>Arent relocated to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and was among the first proprietors when houselots were partitioned in 1652. The next year he took the oath that gave him full municipal rights. He also had a lot on the river north of the village. In 1658, he leased an island in the Hudson and paid rent in wheat in oats.</p>

<p>In 1662, he was among the first patentees of 
<a href="http://www.scpl.org/history/resources/">Schenectady</a>. Failing to reach his fiftieth birthday, Arent Andriesse Bradt died in 1663. His children married the children of Schenectady's leading families and established strong Bradt presence on the Mohawk as well!</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Arent Andriesse Bradt is CAP biography 4181. 
        This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../bios/b/bradt.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. It relies 
        heavily on Peter R. Christoph's <i>A Norwegian Family in Colonial America</i> 
        (1994), 186-90. See also, the <a href="../../fhg.html#bfh">"Bradt Book"</a>, 
        2-3. A profile included in the <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">published 
        Van Rensselaer papers</a> has fueled much of the subsequent interpretation, 
        840. We acknowledge some apprehension and uncertainty regarding external 
        sources and profiles of Albany's earliest residents.</p>
