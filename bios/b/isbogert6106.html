<strong>Isaac H. Bogert</strong></a> was born in September 1765. He was the middle son in the moderate-sized family of <a href="hebogert6097.html">Hendrick</a>  and <a href="../m/bamarselis634.html">Barbara Marselis</a> Bogert. He grew up in the riverside <a href="../../census1790.html#6097">home</a> of a skipper-turned-surveyor. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6097">1788</a>, he was a boarder in his father's first ward house. Perhaps, he had office space elsewhere in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In January 1789, he married eighteen-year-old <a href="../v/cavisscher4106.html">Catharina Visscher</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their daughter was born in December. Perhaps the marriage only produced one more child. In <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">1815</a>, he was identified as an church elder

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1796">1796</a> and 1800, he served as a fireman in Albany.

<p>In August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#mont">1797</a>, he was living in the Montgomery Street house of Gerrit W. Van Schaick when it was among those destroyed during a <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">great fire</a>.

<p>Between 1788 and 1813, his name is otherwise mostly absent from Albany rolls. He may have left Albany during this time. &nbsp; <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="Perhaps he re-located to New York"></a>

<p>In 1813, Isaac Bogert was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as a resident of 77 Court Street. Subsequent directories further document his Albany residency at  several addresses along North and South Market Street. He also was called "Colonel" Isaac H. Bogert.


<p>According to his family bible <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible14.htm">record</a>, Isaac H. Bogert died of apoplexy on September 22 1841. He was buried in the church cemetery. His widow passed in 1845.</p>
