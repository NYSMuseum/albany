<strong>Hendrick Beekman</strong></a> was born in March 1707. He was the son of <a href="jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Martense</a> and his second wife, <a href="../v/evvinhagen3417.html">Eva Vinhagen</a> Beekman. He grew up in a large, combined family in the house of a prominent Albany businessman located in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>The <a href="../../wills/willjombeekman3858.html">will</a> filed by his father in December 1728, divided his large estate among his widow and twelve surviving children. Johannes M. Beekman died in 1732 but widow Eva lived until 1755. 
 
<p>In November 1737, Hendrick married <a href="../s/answitts5649.html">Anna Switts</a>. By 1752, six children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.


<p>Hendrick Beekman probably was dead by the mid-1760s when the widow of Hendrick Beekman was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">listed</a> as the owner of valuable lands on the east side of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and in the first ward of Albany where she lived with their son.</p>
