<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dirck Anthony Bradt</strong></a> was born in March 1695. He was the son of <a href="anbbradt4197.html">Anthony B.</a> and <a href="../e/wiegb4544.html">Willempie Teunisz</a> Bradt. He was a middle child in the large family of Albany mainliners whose <a href="../../census1697.html#083">home</a> was located just beyond the city's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north gate</a>. With other contemporary Dircks at risk in Albany, this sketch focuses on the life of Dirck Anthony Bradt. 

<p>In September 1719, he married <a href="../w/cowaldron.html">Cornelia Waldron</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740, eleven children had been christened at the Albany church where the parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>These Bradts made their home in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West Manor</a> north of Albany where Dirck practiced the <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith's</a> trade. In 1766 and 1767, his Rensselaerswyck holdings were valued moderately on local assessment rolls. He continued to acquire adjoining lands as late as <a href="../../res/realestate.html">1765</a>. 

<p>Dirck filed a <a href="../../wills/willdibradt3084.html">will</a> in December 1763. His estate included real and personal property. It named his wife and children (perhaps only two were still alive) as heirs. Dirck A. Bradt was dead by June 1767 when his will passed probate. Albany native and Rensselaerswyck resident, Dirck Anthony Bradt had lived for more than seventy years.</p>
