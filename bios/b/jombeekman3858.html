<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Martense Beekman</b></a> was born about 1660. He was the son of Marte <a href="#parents">or</a> Martin Beekman.</p>


<p>His first wife was <a href="../s/macscher5483.html">Machtelt Jacobs Schermerhorn</a>. She died about 1690 after giving birth to at least four children. He re-married in October 1692. This time to <a href="../v/evvinhagen3417.html">Eva Vinhagen</a>. By 1710, nine of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and Johannes was a church officer and auditor. Both of them were very frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Beekmans were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#134">mainstays</a> and lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. He traded in <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>, owned other parcels within the city,  and investment property <a href="../../na/kayad.html">beyond</a> as well. Although sometimes identified as a blacksmith, assessment rolls valued his holdings comparable to those of other successful businessmen. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3858">1699</a>, he joined other Albany people in swearing allegiance to the King of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3858">1720</a>, he was identified as a freeholder in the second ward.</p>

<p>Civic service included sitting on juries, acting as assessor, serving as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, and being elected assistant alderman in 1688 and afterwards. He also was asked to perform contract services for the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>.</p> 

<p>Johannes Martense Beekman filed a <a href="../../wills/willjombeekman3858.html">will</a> in December 1728. It provided for his wife and twelve living children! He died in September 1732. Eva lived until 1755.</p>
