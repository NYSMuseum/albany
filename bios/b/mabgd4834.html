<strong>Mary Bloodgood</strong></a> was born during the early 1740s. She probably was the daughter of Francis and Mary Bloodgood of Flushing and the sister of <a href="abbgd7351.html">brothers</a> who settled in Albany during the 1760s. 

<p>She was the wife of <a href="../f/chfoll8065.html">Charles Folliet</a> (Folliot). Their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1768 and 1779. 

<p>Folliet was once a carpenter whose home was in the second and then in the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a>. Weathering the scrutiny occasioned by his pro-British sympathies, he may have moved his family to <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> where a Charles Folliet was listed on the census of <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. 


<p>Mary Bloodgood Folliet went with her husband to Rensselaer County where she was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/cemf5.txt">buried</a> in  January 1796. She had lived fifty-six years and eight months. Her husband survived until 1818.</p>
