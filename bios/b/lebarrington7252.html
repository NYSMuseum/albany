<strong>Lewis Barrington</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">p</a>erhaps Lucas Barrington) possibly was born about 1750. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on his origins and path to Albany. We also seek information on a possible connection to contemporary Albany resident <a href="nibarrington7237.html">Nicholas Barrington</a>. 

<p>He <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> the American cause as an enlisted man in Col. John Harper's regiment of levies. Afterwards, he was accored a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7252">land bounty right</a> in association with the city militia regiment. 

<p>His first wife was Jane White. Their son was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in December 1778. She died and, by 1782, he had married Albany native <a href="../a/mgtadams7094.html">Margaret Adams</a> with whom he had six children christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a> between 1782 and 1792.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1781">1781</a>, he was appointed constable for the second ward.


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7252">1788</a>, his property and house were valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7252">1790</a>, his second ward household was configured on the Albany census.

<p>In June 1791, Anna Van Iveren granted him power of attorney for the sale of a "negro man slave named Jacob." In February 1796, he purchased a lot on the north side of Ferry Street from Rensselaer and Elizabeth Schuyler.

<p>Lewis Barrington died in May 1797 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
