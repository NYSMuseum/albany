<P>Based on subsequent sources, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Brown</strong></a> was born <a href="../../census1800.html#7461">prior</a> to 1756. A number of same-named contemporaries are at risk in the region. We seek precise information on this individual's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, the following may be of some value.

<p>In March 1761, a William Brown was <a href="https://archive.org/stream/browngenealogyof03brow/browngenealogyof03brow_djvu.txt">identified</a> as the son and heir in the will of Thomas Brown of Stonington, Connecticut. That recently encountered resource may hold the key to basic family questions.

<p>Perhaps he came of age prior to the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>. However, so many William <a href="brown.html">Brown</A>s are at-risk for the 1760s and the 1770s that we have not assigned additional qualitative information on this Albany resident at this time.

<p>In August 1776, he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Polly" (aka Mary) Cadogan at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At the time, the partners were identified as single people of "this county." A number of children were christened by William Brown during the later 1770s but only the daughter baptized <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part6.html">on</a> March 10, 1779 could claim "Mary Cadogan" as her mother. Over the next decade, more children were presented by the couple at the Albany <a href="../../stpeters.html">Episcopal</a> church.

<p>This William Brown served the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary cause - at least partially in an Albany-related context. In June 1775, a William Brown was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_GwsAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=%22brown,+william+(N.+Y.)%22&source=bl&ots=GePExpSBVO&sig=3cvMW7IILfwsBIWVe-gCBkmHudY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiXg_TnhYLNAhVDVT4KHTXcDBkQ6AEINzAH#v=onepage&q=%22brown%2C%20william%20(N.%20Y.)%22&f=false">commissioned</a> first lieutenant in the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">First New York Regiment</a>. The following July, he was elevated to captain. After the war,  a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7461">William T. Brown</a> was awarded a land bounty right in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7461">March 1779</a>, his lot only was valued on the Albany assessment for the third ward. That October, another <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">city roll</a> placed modest value on two pieces of property for William Brown. However, in 1788, two separate listings assessed the residence and property of William Brown in the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wibr">second</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7461">third</a> wards. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the first ward assessment roll had two entries for William Brown. His house and lot in the first ward was valued very modestly. Another entry, also in the first ward, valued moderately only the personal property of William Brown. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Per</a>haps he was reserving space in the shop of artisan <a href="../b/nebassett7261.html">Nehemiah B. Bassett</a> at 42 State Street.

<p>In 1790, the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> for the city of Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#7461">listed</a> the second ward household of William Brown. Living there was a man, 2 younger males, and four females. A decade later, he was <a href="../../census1800.html#7461">enumerated</a> in the first ward in a house with an adult male, three children, but no women were counted.

<p>In April <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, he was identified on an Albany jury list as a mariner. He often was called "Captain."

<p>Beginning with the first edition published in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22brown+william%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=%22brown%2C%20william%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was listed in the 
<a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as a merchant at 44 and/or 42 State Street.

      <p>During the probate of the <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> 
        of a first ward resident dating to 1788 - but proved in 1818, William 
        Brown was identified as the husband of Elizabeth, the daughter of the 
        testator's sister. Perhaps, Elizabeth was a second wife or else the spouse 
        of a different William Brown. 
      <p>On December 24, 1825, the Albany newspaper <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22capt+william+brown%22+albany&source=bl&ots=cOqU_Ih8NO&sig=gHUYM7iBMG6nuSaOugoPbbJ_Cfc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0meue1frMAhWGPT4KHUl7Dj0Q6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&q=%22capt%20william%20brown%22%20albany&f=false">reported</a> that "Captain" William Brown died at age sixty-three. He was buried from  his residence at 42 State Street. His will was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probated</a> in Albany County in July 1826. His widow survived until 1834.</p>
