<strong>John Bay</strong></a> was born in August 1743. He was the son of William Bay of Maryland. His family was of <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> background.

<p>He graduated from Princeton in 1765 and soon afterwards settled in Albany where he sought to teach school. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home and property were valued on the Albany assessment roll.

      <p>In December 1769, he married innkeeper's daughter <a href="../w/anwilliams6289.html">Hannah 
        Williams</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican 
        church. The marriage produced five children including two physicians and 
        an attorney. However, their names were absent from a list of St. Peter's 
        church members dated <a href="../../coerec1771.html">1771</a>. 
      <p>In 1771, he was characterized as an Albany "schoolmaster" when he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjovdh5697.html">will</a> of his neighbor. The next year, he was managing a lottery to benefit the "English <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church." In 1774, he was identified as an attorney.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he declared for the American cause and was elected to represent the first ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. He served briefly as secretery of that organization. In 1776, he signed the "General Association." 

<p>But soon he moved his budding family to Claverack where he served as secretery of the district sub-committee for the duration of its life. On a number of occasions, he was exempted from active military duty. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Eighth Regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>After the war, he established a significant legal practice out of Claverack and also trained attorneys. He was elected to the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> - beginning in 1779 and served into the mid-1790s.
<p>John Bay died at Claverack in June 1818. His widow survived until 1845.</p>
