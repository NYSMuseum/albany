<P><a href="#sources"><b>Susanna Bradt</b></a> was born in October 1697. She was the eldest daughter of Albany residents <a href="dabradt4340.html">Daniel</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3232.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Bradt. She grew up in a trader's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.</p>


<p>In 1718, she married Albany native <a href="../h/hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick Hallenbeck</a> at the Albany<a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By the mid 1740s, their thirteen children were christened there where Susanna was a member and a sponsor at a number of family baptisms.

<p>These Hallenbecks raised their large family on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany where his family owned extensive acreage.</p>

<p>After more than forty years of marriage, Hendrick Hallenbeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> in November 1764. - naming her his beloved wife and chief beneficiary. They had lived in a house on the southside of Albany - overlooking a large pasture just beyond the stockade. Following his death in 1766, the widow (mother of many living children and trustee of extensive city acreage) continued to <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4279">reside</a> in their house until her death in November 1787. 

<p>Widow Susanna was buried from the Albany Dutch church but probably finally reposed in the Hallenbeck <a href="../../loc/hallbg.html">burying ground</a> located next to her <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home. This matriarch had lived in Albany for ninety years.</p>
