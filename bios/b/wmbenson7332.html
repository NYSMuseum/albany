<strong>William Benson</strong></a> probably was a British businessman who settled in Albany after the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. He may have come to Albany as the representative of New York-based trading interests with which William Benson was connected as early as 1759.

<p>By the mid-1760s, he had settled in as his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> with the top five percent of the city's householders. In 1766, he <a href="../../solconst.html#7332">signed</a> the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. In 1767, he belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. 

<p>He was a member and officer of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. He also was a prominent member and the secretary of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>.

<p>During the 1760s, he was identified as one of the petitioners for a tract of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">frontier land</a> in the Schoharie valley. In 1771, he was listed with the petitioners for a tract that became "Bayard's Patent." In June 1772, he was <a href="http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:lGBpqPwXfsYJ:www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/nysboxes.pdf+%22william+benson%22+albany&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=10&gl=us">referenced</a> in a land transaction for property along the Hosack Road. At that time, the notation was to "creditors of William Benson late of the City of Albany.


<p>William Benson's immediate prominence in Albany over a short period of time justifies this admittedly premature <a href="../../res/bios.html#sketch">baseline sketch</a>. We seek information on his origins and life after Albany!</p>

The life of William Benson is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 7332. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Again, we seek more defining information on this individual. Did he marry Mary Stewart in 1759? Was he one of the recipients of a tract of land in Nova Scotia in 1787? Because he was not listed on a St. Peter's <a href="../../coerec1771.html">membership roll</a> in 1771, he probabaly had left Albany by that time. Was he the William Benson whose household was configured on the Ballstown <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> in 1790? Or, was he a descendant of <a href="dibensing7319.html">Dirck Bensing</a> - a resident of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>?
