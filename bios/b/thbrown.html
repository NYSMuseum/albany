<P>In <a href="../../census1800.html#thbr">1800</a>, the census for the first ward in Albany configured the household of one <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Brown</strong></a>. In that home were a man and a woman born prior to 1756 and another female aged 16-24. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. We are unsure if the Reverend <a href="thbrown7460.html">Thomas Brown</a> was an antecedent.

<p>This individual is at-risk to have married as three potential marriages were listed in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church</a> records beginning in February 1776 when <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Thomas Brown wed "Jannetje La Garmay" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
 
      <p>Perhaps this Thomas Brown is one of two same-named individuals whose 
        households were configured on the Ballstown census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. 
        Those Ballstown residents had been referenced in the <a href="../../coc.html">records</a> 
        of wartime organizations more than a decade earlier. More than a dozen 
        Thomas Browns were listed on the 1790 census statewide. 
      <p>In November <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, a Thomas Brown was identified as a "cartman" on a list of potential jurors for the Albany <a href="../../org/mayorct.html">Mayor's Court</a>.

      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, Thomas Brown's personal 
        property was valued modestly on a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
        assessment roll. And, in <a href="../../census1800.html#thbr">1800</a>, 
        his household was configured on the first ward census. That was the last 
        reference encountered during our ongoing sweep of community and <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based</a> 
        resources. 
      <p>Unsure of defining demographics for the many potential same-named contemporaries, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of this Albany resident named Thomas Brown.</p>
