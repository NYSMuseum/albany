<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hugh Boyd</strong></a> was born in January 1767. He was the son of <a href="joboyd7399.html">John</a> and <a href="../l/anlogan7596.html">Ann        Logan</a> Boyd. He was an older son in the large family of <a href="../irish.html">Scots-Irish</a> emigr&eacute;s who settled in Albany during the 1760s.
 
<p>As a recently arrived British merchant, his father's activities came under <a href="../../friends.html">sc</a>rutiny during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. John Boyd, Sr. managed to survive the war to see several of his sons take their places in the postwar Albany business community.
  
<p>In 1790, Hugh probably was one of the three men <a href="../../census1790.html#7399">listed</a> on the census in his father's third ward household. Two years earlier, his personal property was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7398">valued</a> under that  location.

<p>In 1794, he was among the Albany notables who <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#7398">subscribed</a> for the support of Union College.
<p>In January 1796, Hugh married the somewhat younger Albany native <a href="../s/castaats6280.html">Catharina Staats</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the next two decades, the marriage produced at least ten children. However, Hugh Boyd was a member and trustee of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.
 
<p>Hugh Boyd was a merchant in partnership with Hamilton Boyd. They held a storehouse and dock space on <a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay Street</a>. Assessment rolls <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">valued</a>         his house and lots on Dock Street. He also was known as a "mariner." In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA47&dq=%22boyd+hugh%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22boyd%20hugh%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed his address at 30 Dock Street and his 
        store at 42 Quay. 
 <p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7398">1800</a>, his first ward household 
        was described on the Albany census. A decade later, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> 
        marked the growth of his family. 
      <p>In 1813, he began to sell off his Albany holdings. In 1814, he purchased 
        100 <a href="../../res/realestate.html">acres</a> along the Normanskill 
        in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> - an emerging, less 
        congested area south of the city. His new home was on lands settled by 
        his wife's family the <a href="../s/staats.html">Staats</a>es. Shortly thereafter, he was able to augment those holdings.
		
      <p>Hugh Boyd filed a <a href="#will">will</a> on December 27, 1816. He died 
        two days later. He had lived just under fifty years. His will passed probate 
        in February 1817. His widow probably moved in with family members and 
        survived until 1840. </p>
