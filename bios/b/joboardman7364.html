Thus, he was the son of Charles Boardman of Wethersfield, Connecticut. At age eighteen, he is said to have been apprenticed as a carpenter and then relocated to Georgia. About 1792, he is said to have settled in Albany where he remained for the rest of his life. At least one more same-named contemporary is <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=137252153">at-risk</a> in the region. We seek to ascertain a connection with Albany contemporary <a href="wmboardman7367.html">William Boardman</a>.

<p>In January 1794, he married <a href="../g/abgoodrich.html">Abigail Goodrich</a> also of Wethersfield. Their second son George was christened at the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church of Albany in February 1797. By 1816, the marriage had produced a total of at least nine children. Beginning in 1807, he was a trustee of that church. In 1815, he switched 
to the recently organized Second Presbyterian church. Subsequently, he was an <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Pu0qAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=%22john+Boardman%22+albany&source=bl&ots=_OzX2aVvtV&sig=4tMFK2ZBpNmev3ZOFsopm2dU0bA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs08WVrfjNAhWGXB4KHQ3cDCM4ChDoAQguMAY#v=onepage&q=%22john%20Boardman%22%20albany&f=false">officer</a> of that church as well.

<p>In March 1798, his name appeared on a list of <a href="../../org/mayorct.html">eligible</a> jurors. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a>.

<p>By <a href="../../census1800.html#7364">1800</a>, he was listed on the census as the head of a household in the first ward. A year <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">earlier</a>, his house and lot there were valued modestly. Beginning with the first edition in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22boardman+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=boardman&f=false">1813</a>, he was identified as a builder at 93 State Street. He was listed at that address at least until 1830. In 1815, he also was listed among the registered cartmen in the city. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> returns account for the aging of his family.

      <p>Over several decades, he was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jzM8wF0vWdQC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=%22john+Boardman%22+albany&source=bl&ots=yiR7Fmn0wc&sig=OTsACbbmOxF7-hyJ5TyadA0S1_0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjb4NbUqvjNAhXE1h4KHRrCAQMQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&q=%22john%20Boardman%22%20albany&f=false">identified</a> 
        with the construction of a number of public and private city buildings. 
        He was known as a "master builder" and also employed and trained apprentices. 
      <p>He was a member and an officer of the <a href="../../ams.html#members">Albany Mechanics Society</a> as well as a number of other community-based organizations.
 
<p>In April 1853, the newspaper reported the passing of John Boardman, "age 82, [an] original elder of the 2nd Presbyterian church." His <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=HthSAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA786&lpg=PA786&dq=%22john+Boardman%22+albany&source=bl&ots=E1_VGgpRnN&sig=F0591bF5-auWdLIFaLr0kF6VXmc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs08WVrfjNAhWGXB4KHQ3cDCM4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20Boardman%22%20albany&f=false">funeral sermon</a> was printed later that year.
