      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Bogardus</strong></a> was baptized 
        in New Amsterdam in April 1645. He was the son of <a href="evbogardus.html">Everardus</a> 
        and <a href="../j/anjans.html">Anneke Jans</a> Bogardus. His father was 
        the community's <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Reformed</a> minister and 
        his mother was a prominent widow. The domine died unexpectedly in 1647 
        and Anneke Jans took her children upriver to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
        where she died in 1663. Her <a href="../../wills/willanjans.html">will</a>, 
        filed in 1663, left him a share of her substantial estate. 
      <p>Pieter's wife was <a href="wybosch.html">Wyntie Cornelisz Bosch</a> whom 
        he <a href="../../res/ts.html">may</a> have married in 1665. By 1691, 
        the marriage had produced eight children who were christened at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and regular 
        baptism sponsor. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6381">1679</a>, his name appeared on 
        a census of Albany householders. Although also called a "glazier" and 
        a "mariner," his community standing would place him among Albany's businessmen. 
        He was a magistrate during the 1670s and was elected first ward <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> 
        in 1693. He often performed contract services for Albany organizations 
        that included repairing windows in the poor house in 1667. In <a href="../../census1697.html#093">1697</a>, 
        his home was configured on the <a href="../../census.html">census</a> 
        of Albany householders. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6381">1699</a>, 
        he signed an oath of allegiance to the king of England. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, 
        his first ward home was valued on the assessment roll. He appears to have 
        left Albany shortly thereafter. However, his pasture land still was noted 
        on the Albany assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6381">1709</a>. 
      <p>Stating that he was a resident of Kingston, Pieter Bogardus filed a <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus6381.html">will</a> 
        in February 1703. He probably died about 1703. It named his widow and 
        three sons (but no daughters) as heirs. However, Wyntie was deceased when 
        the will was probated in Ulster County in 1714. Son Evert then was named 
        to administer the estate.</p>
