          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Jan Janse</B></A> was the founder of the Albany <a  href="bleecker.html">Bleecker 
            family</a>. Tradition holds that he came to New Netherland in 1658 
            and soon after settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>.</p>

<p>Initially, young Jan Janse brought a blacksmith's skill to the <a href= "../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. While coming of age as a trader, Jan Janse improved his lot by teaching school, serving as a notary, and representing the cases of others before the Albany court.</p>

          <p>In 1667, he married <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">Margaret Van Woert</a>, 
            the daughter of an Albany brewer. Between 1668 and 1692, their ten 
            children were baptized in the Albany <A href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> where both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsers. 
            A pillar of the church, Jan Janse served as deacon and elder from 
            the 1670s until his death.</p>

<p><p>These Bleeckers lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>  where Jan Janse was an <a href="../../census1679.html#jjb">Albany mainstay</a>. During the <a href="#1670s">1670s</a>, he began to buy and sell town lots and was very active in the Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market. Like many aspiring traders, he appeared frequently before the Albany court as plaintiff, defendent, and witness. As he prospered, he also invested in <a href="#tracts">land</a> outside of Albany.</p>

          <p>During the 1680s, he served on the Albany court and was identified as a commissary. 
            In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1686">1686</a>, he was appointed one of the first aldermen under the new 
            <a href="../../charter.html">city charter</a>. Governor Dongan also named 
            him first <a href="../../corporation.html#treas">chamberlain</a> or city treasurer. As a member of the Albany 
            <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>, he sat as a justice and 
            served as one of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. 
            While serving at the muncipal level, he was elected to represent Albany 
            in the provincial Assembly in 1698. Named recorder of Albany in 1696, 
            his public career <a href="../../census1697.html#147">peaked</a> with his appointment as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
            of Albany in 1700. He served for a year and was succeeded by his eldest 
            <a href="jjbleecker199.html">son</a>.</p>
 
          <p>Jan Janse's sons extended the Bleecker trade network deeper into the Indian 
            country during the <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> of 1714-44. In 1715, 
            their father became a <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> British subject - further cementing the <a href="bleecker.html">family's</a> establishment in America.</p>

          <p>Jan Janse <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2">lived</a> out his long life 
            in Albany - patriarch of a large and successful family. He died on 
            November 21, 1732. Margarita passed less than a year later. Both were 
            buried beneath the Albany church.</p>
