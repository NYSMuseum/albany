<P>Silversmith/engraver <a href="#sources"> <strong>Joseph Balch</strong></a> is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/15105.htm">said</a> to have been born in 1760 or '65. We seek definitive documentation on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, training, and path to Albany.

<p>He <a href="http://archive.org/stream/genealogyofbalch00balc/genealogyofbalch00balc_djvu.txt">probably</a> was of <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> background. A future silversmith named Joseph Balch was born in Hartford, Connecticut in February 1760. Thus, he would have been a son of Ebeneezer and his second wife Lois Belden Balch. His father was a silversmith and clockmaker.

<p>Joseph is <a href="../../inprog.html">said</a> to have served in the Revolutionary army as a drummer boy.

<p>In June <a href="../../doc/nn1.html#1784">1784</a>, an Albany newspaper advertized that Balch & <a href="../f/jofryer8136.html">Fryer</a> had "opened a shop near the north gate, for the purpose of carrying on the gold and silversmith's business." However, his Albany sojourn <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/15105.htm">appears</a> to have lasted but a decade.

<p>In 1786, he married Mary Watson in Weathersfield, Connecticut . Their family included seven children.

<p>By 1794, he had re-located to Williamstown, Massachuesetts.

<p>In 1810, he removed to Johnstown, New York where he died in December 1855.  

<p>Family-based resources <a href="http://archive.org/stream/genealogyofbalch00balc/genealogyofbalch00balc_djvu.txt">noted</a> that Joseph Balch "was a thorough Christian and gentleman. His memory was retentive and he was always abreast of the times. His faculties he retained to the last."</p>
