<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Mary Brouwer</strong></a> was born in October 1738. She was the daughter of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents Cornelis and Cornelia Barheit <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~brouwergenealogydata/p78.htm#i37039">Brouwer</a>. She grew up as the youngest child in the small family of a Mohawk Valley agrarian businesssman.

<p>In April 1760, she married newcomer and widower <a href="../m/jomunro1526.html">John Munro</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Schenectady. Their son was christened there in October 1768. Her marriage to a somewhat <a href="../../marriages.html#young">o</a>lder man is said to have ultimately produced at least six children. However, they do not appear in the available records of the Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Their last <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Loyalist+son+comes+home+to+Morrisburg%3A+memorial+for+William+Johnson...-a030150364">son</a> appears to have been born in Montreal in 1781.

<p>In August 1765, she was identified as the wife of Albany merchant Munro and named to inherit twenty (or 120) pounds in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22john+monroe+of+albany%22&source=bl&ots=4QMpYuoW1O&sig=bDq47Y_Tt-w2hBFKmJSRKnDU9JU&hl=en&ei=Lc49TO25IoH7lwf99fD4BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20monroe%20of%20albany%22&f=false">will</a> filed by her father.  

<p>A discharged soldier, Munro was a British-connected, regional trader with bases in Albany and elsewhere. He also was a British subject and was known to <a href="../../friends.html">not</a> be a supporter of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties.

<p>During the 1770s, Munro re-located his family to his lands in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">H</a>oosick Valley and left Mary and the children there when he joined the British military forces. Sometime thereafter, they joined him in Canada. These Munros finally settled in Ontario. We are uncertain regarding Mary's subsequent contacts with her Brouwer kin.
 
<p>These Munros were living in Canada when John Munro died in October 1800. Perhaps the widow moved in with one of her adult sons. Mary Brouwer Munro died in Morrisburg, Ontario in 1815.</p>
