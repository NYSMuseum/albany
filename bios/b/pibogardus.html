<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Bogardus</strong></a> was born in March 1711. He was the first child of Albany natives <a href="shbogardus6387.html">Shibboleth</a> and <a href="../d/andgarmo783.html">Anna De Garmo</a> Bogardus. He grew up in a large family in a home on <a href="../../streets.html#middle">Middle Alley</a> in the <a href".././wards.html#2">second ward</A>. His parents died during the late 1740s leaving five young adults to share their modest estate. This Albany resident sometimes was known as "Pieter S. Bogardus."

In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>, Pieter was named constable for the second ward.

<p>This individual does not seem to have married and probably lived with his younger bachelor <a href="jabogardus6375.html">brother</a> in the second ward. Both of them were known as <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sk</a>ippers. A third <a href="shbogardus6388.html">brother</a> was involved in riverfront activities. An <a href="anbogardus6358.html">uncle</a> was a "ship's carpenter." We <a href="../qqqq.html">hope</a> to find more information on their enterprises. 
 
<p>Albany mariner Pieter Bogardus filed a <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus.html">will</a> on October 14, 1756. Without direct heirs, his estate was left to his siblings. He died a week later at age forty-five and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the <a href="../../drc.html">church</a>yard. His will passed probate in 1762.</p>
