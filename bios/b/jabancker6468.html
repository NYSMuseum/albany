<strong>Jannetie Bancker</strong></a> was born in August 1701. She was the daughter of Albany leaders <a href="ebancker6454.html">Evert</a> and <a href="../a/elabeel118.html">Elizabeth Abeel</a> Bancker. She grew up in a wealthy businessman's homes in Albany and New York and at the family farm located west of Albany.


<p>In December 1722, she married Albany native <a href="../s/haschuyler1320.html">Harmanus Schuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1756, seven children had been christened at the Dutch churches in Albany and New York.

<p>Her husband began his adult life as a merchant/trader in Albany. But by the mid-1720s, he had  relocated to New York where he was known as a baker and represented his family in business. Jannetie and the children followed and these Schuylers were Manhattan mainstays for the next two decades. 

<p>In 1734, she was named to share in the <a href="../../wills/willebancker6454.html">estate</a> of her father.

<p>Harmanus Schuyler died in December 1748. Jannetie Bancker Schuyler passed in April 1757 and was buried in New York.</p>
