<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Engeltie Bradt</strong></a> appears to have been born in January 1735. Thus, she was the daughter of Dirck and Cornelia Waldron Bradt. This middle child grew up in a the large family of a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> blacksmith.

<p>In September 1754, she married <a href="../d/wodef4748.html">Wouter De Foreest</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1761, three children had been christened in Albany.

<p>Following a path walked by many of his kin, Wouter De Foreest was a middling tradesman and city placeholder who brought his much younger bride to raise their fledgling family in his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>However, church records reveal that Engeltie Bradt De Foreest was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in June 1763.


<p>In December of that year, she was identified as a deceased daughter in the <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=cFIOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=%22dirck+brat%22+blacksmith&source=bl&ots=aB60ZTBSw4&sig=RrpRSCW6JfJCOIEnUOIz2HtopnM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rJfHUOyiLamp0AG864DYCA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22dirck%20brat%22%20blacksmith&f=false"">will</a> filed by her father. At that time, her two living sons were acknowledged.
<p>Albany wife and mother, Engeltie Bradt De Foreest had lived but twenty-eight years. Two months after her death, Wouter re-married and fathered seven more children.</p>
