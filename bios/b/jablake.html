<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Blake </strong></a> lived in Albany from the 1780s until his death in the mid-1820s. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>His wife was <a href="../../res/sp.html">called</a> "Nancy." Their son, Henry, was christened at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> in August 1787. Another son, christened Jacob in March 1797, had parents James and Anna Blake. His name has not been found among the extant records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7342">1790</a>, his first ward home included a man, a boy, and one female.

<p>In 1794 and 1797, he was <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/ead/htmldocs/RMM00381.html">involved</a> in Albany County indentures. 

<p>The first ward census for <a href="../../census1800.html#7243">1800</a>, showed his household with three young boys, a man 26-54, a young girl and a woman over 55 yeats of age. A year earlier, his property and holdings at that location were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">valued</a> moderately.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22blake+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22blake%20james%22&f=false">1813</a>, James Blake was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as a cartman living at 49 <a href="../../streets.html#cow">Union Street</a>.
 
<p>The <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> of James Blake was recorded in January 1826. In 1827, the directory listed his widow as the principal inhabitant of his Union Street home.</p>
