<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes J. Beekman</b></a> was born in 1701. He was the son of <a href="jombeekman3858.html">Johannes Martense</a> and his second wife, <a href="../v/evvinhagen3417.html">Eva Vinhagen</a> Beekman. He grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where his father was a prominent blacksmith, businessman, and landholder.</p>


<p>In July 1729, he married trader's daughter <a href="../c/sacuyler611.html">Sara Cuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a frequent baptism sponsor. By 1744, six children of the marriage had been christened in Albany. Sara Cuyler Beekman died in 1746. Left with a young family, Johannes soon re-married. His second wife was <a href="../vs/devschaick4029.html">Debora Van Schaick</a>. Their son was born in 1749.</p>

<p>These Beekmans also lived in the second ward where he was known as a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> and <a href="../../census1756.html#257">skipper/shipper</a>. After serving as constable and assistant alderman for fifteen years, in September 1759, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> for the second ward. Johannes held that office until his death. The home he built on Pearl Street about 1725 became an outstanding Albany <a href="../../loc/vdhpalace.html">landmark</a>.  </p>

<p>Stating that he was "sick," Johannes J. Beekman filed a <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3861.html">will</a> in May of 1756. Because he was re-elected to the city council in September 1757, perhaps he was not (<font size=-1>although stranger recordings have been encountered in the community record</font size>) the "Johannes Beekman" buried in the church cemetery on October 26, 1756. He was more certainly deceased by October 1759 when his will passed probate. </p>
