<P>During the early 1700s, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Richard Brewer</strong></a> was an officer in the <a href="../../garrison.html">Albany garrison</a>. His marriage record in 1702 noted that he was born in "Old England" - most likely during the 1670s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Frequent <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elling variations of his name ("Brnuwe" for one) give us pause that "Brewer" may not be the most accurate spelling. At the same time, he does not seem to have been related to the "<a href="nibrouwer.html">Br</a>ouwer" family of Albany and beyond.

<p><a href="#dk">P</a>erhaps he was the "Ric. Brewer, Junr" who, in 1692, was commissioned an ensign in the 12th Regiment of Foot commanded by Colonel Richard Brewer. The new officer was described as "a child." After stops in Ireland and the West Indies, some of the remaining men were sent to New York. By the end of 1700, Richard Brewer's name was appearing on the roll of a company destined for <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison duty</a> at Albany and other places.



<p>In October or November 1702, Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> records noted that he <a href="#marr">marr</a>ied <a href="../s/cascherp.html">Catharina Scharp</a> at the "groom's house." In August 1704, "Lieut. Brnwer" <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part2.html">witnessed</a> the baptism of Patrick Mc Gregory's son with one "Anna Hoges." Otherwise, his name seems to be absent from the extant records of the Albany church.

<p>In June 1703, on behalf of the other officers and soldiers of the "major's garrison" posted in Albany," he requested that those <a href="../../newcomers.html">new</a>comers be accorded the "freedom of Albany." 

<p>In March <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lY1YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=%22cornelis+teunise+van+vechten%22&source=bl&ots=uR-MvFMYvN&sig=SF84-yNzFnLPO3bLn6HkvexdK9w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qg40U-KKKMXvoASl1oLwAg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20teunise%20van%20vechten%22&f=false">1705</a>, he acted as an attorney for Rensselaerswyck resident <a href="../vv/cotvvechten2449.html">Cornelis T. Van Vechten</a>. Significantly, his adversary was represented by <a href="../c/jcollins.html">John Collins</a>, a fellow garrison officer and perhaps Albany's first professional lawyer.

        the first decade of the eighteenth century (1704-08), the upkeep of Lt. 
        Brewer's house/quarters in Albany was underwritten by provincial officials. 
        In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=69kTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=%22brewer&source=bl&ots=Iqbfe8_nTN&sig=oFDPXH8fkYdMqFQWUiPwpIBcTBs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KRhHU-uRD8WcyQHWj4G4CQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22brewer%2C%20richard%22%20albany&f=false">1706</a>, 
        he was boarded in the house of <a href="../s/alsling5408.html">Albert 
        Slingerland</a>. In September, he escorted French prisoners from Albany 
        to New York. 
      <p>In October 1708, he identified himself as one of the executors of the will of "Thomas Sharpe, late gunner of Albany for pay due [the] deceased."

      <p>In December 1711, Brewer, sent a letter to Secretary Clarke requesting that 
        he be commissioned a captain in the next expedition against Canada. 
      <p>Richard Brewer died sometime thereafter. In May 1719, his widow <a href="../s/phphschuyler.html">married</a> into the Schuyler family.</p>
