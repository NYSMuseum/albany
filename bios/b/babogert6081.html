<strong>Barent Bogert</strong></a> was born at the beginning of 1745. He was the only son born to the marriage of <a href="dobogert6089.html">Douwe</a> and <a href="wibradt4283.html">Willempie Bradt</a> Bogert. He grew up in a shoemaker's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>He also followed the <a href="../../trades/leather.html">leather</a> trades and owned a tanning <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">pit</a> on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> as well.

<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#6081">1766</a>, he joined with other Albany men in signing a constitution for the Albany Sons of Liberty. In 1767, he was listed on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, he was appointed high constable.

<p>In October 1776, he appeared before the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Corespondence</a> to report that his tanning pit was robbed by two individuals and that four sides of leather had been stolen. Otherwise, his name has not yet been found in the community record for the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> years. However, afterward, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6081">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.


<p>About 1775, he married <a href="../vd/alvdb5721.html">Alida Vandenbergh</a>. By 1796, their seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>, where he was a member and the church <a href="../../drc.html#sexton">sexton</a> for a number of years.

<p>Barent's father probably died during the 1770s. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6081">1788</a>, he was listed as a boarder of modest means in the 
<a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4283">house</a> of his widowed mother. In 
<a href="../../census1790.html#6081">1790</a>, he was named as the head of that second ward household. 

<p>He may have lived in the little "Sexton's House" <a href="../../im/imepearlchurch.html">located</a> next to the "North" Dutch church after it was opened in 1798.

<p>Barent Bogert was the city watchman in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1794">1794-96</a>.

<p>He appears to have died after 1820 when he still was identified as sexton in the city directory.</p>
