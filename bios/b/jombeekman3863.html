      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes M. Beekman</strong></a> was born 
        in March 1722. He was the son in the small family of Albany residents 
        <a href="mabeekman3877.html">Martin</a> and <a href="../v/gevisscher4071.html">Geertruy 
        Visscher</a> Beekman. He grew up in a blacksmith's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In February 1754, he was almost thirty-two when he married Maria Nicolls 
        of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> She died 
        after only one child. A decade later in January 1764, he married <a href="../d/eldouw2077.html">Elizabeth 
        Douw</a>, a younger sister of the <a href="../d/vopdouw2234.html">mayor</a> 
        of Albany. That marriage produced four children who were christened in 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member 
        and pewholder. 
      <p>Perhaps he was one of the two "Jno. Bak/teman"s listed on the <a href="../../census1756.html#139">census</a> 
        of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html#143">1756</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3863">1763</a>, his name appeared 
        on a list of Albany freeholders. 
      <p>He was identified as the first son in the <a href="../../wills/willmabeekman.html">joint 
        will</a> filed by his parents in September 1768. He was named to share 
        the estate with his sister <a href="evbeekman3911.html">Eve Schuyler</a>. 
      <p>These Beekmans also lived in the third ward where his holdings were accorded 
        <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3863">moderate assessments</a>. He 
        seems to have earned a living as a contractor and served the community 
        as firemaster (1753), constable, watch captain, and finally was elected 
        <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> - first in 1778. 
      <p>In May 1776, he stood up for American liberties when he was elected to 
        represent the third ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a>. Previously, he had <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">signed</a> 
        the "General Association". He was active in committee work for the balance 
        of its life. First in 1778, he was elected to the Albany Board of the 
        <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> for Detecting and Defeating 
        Conspiracies and served thru 1780. During that time, he also sat on the 
        Albany city council. Afterwards, he was awarded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html"> 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">militia</a> 
        regiment. 
      <p>At the close of hostilities Beekman was into his sixties and seems to 
        have withdrawn from public life. In 1790, five <a href="../../census1790.html#2077">slaves</a> 
        attended the household - tying this Beekman household for the tenth largest 
        number of slaves in the city. 
      <p>Johannes M. Beekman filed a <a href="../../wills/willjombeekman3863.html">will</a> 
        in October 1787. It passed probate in July 1790. His <a href="../d/eldouw2077.html">widow</a> 
        lived on as the <a href="../../census1790.html#2077">head</a> of their 
        household for more than two <a href="../../census1800.html#2077">decades</a> 
        until her passing in 1811.</p>
