<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Teunis Bradt</strong></a> was born in November 1725. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="anabradt4199.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../vd/revdh5714.html">Rebecca Vanderheyden</a> Bradt. He grew up a middle child in the large family of a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> carpenter. He was christened "Theunis" and would be known consistently in the community as Teunis Bradt perhaps to distinguish him from his father and a number of same-<a href="../../res/sp.html">named</a> contemporaries.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1750">1750</a>, he was appointed constable for the third ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a>, he was named firemaster. During the 1760s, he was a member of an <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> company.

<p>In July 1756, "Teunis" married <a href="../vn/cavness878.html">Catharina Van Ness</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1775, eight children had been christened at the church where both parents were pew holders and frequent baptism sponsors. 

<p>Probabaly initially <a href="../../census1756.html#70">living</a> with his father, he became as <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a>-building contractor as well. As late as December 1787, he was selected to build a dock by the city corporation.

<p>By the mid <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, however, Anthony A. Bradt had died and Teunis was listed on third ward assessment rolls as an Albany property holder near the home of his mother. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4281">1779</a>, and again in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4281">1788</a>, his holdings <a href="../../loc/northend.html">near</a> the river front were valued moderately on third ward assessments. In 1788, perhaps his adult sons were living under his roof as well. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4281">1790</a>, his household was configured at the end of the third ward census. 

<p>In his fifties at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, he served as captain of a company of artifacers who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H8oUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=%22teunis+bradt%22&source=bl&ots=VNybPNDGyU&sig=i8PIt1bNXGRS8bERgYXWtgScMyQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7dBIUZrxA4Pl4AOng4GwBQ&sqi=2&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22teunis%20bradt%22&f=false">worked</a> at Ticonderoga, Lake George, and environs in 1775 thru 1777. In 1776, he was paid for repairing the barracks at Albany and for supplying firewood. In <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">1778</a>, he was among those older residents who were to be held back from active duty except in case of invasion. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4281">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.


<p>In late August <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, he was identified as a carpenter and freeholder in the third ward. However, Teunis Bradt had passed on by early August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">1797</a> when his widow was identified as the resident and owner of record of the Montgomerey Street properties that were destroyed in a fire that started in her stables. She survived there for at least another decade. It seems that this particular Bradt family had dropped from community rolls by <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>.</p>
