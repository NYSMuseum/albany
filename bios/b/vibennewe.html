<P><p><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously (aka "Finschen"), one <a href="#sources"> <strong>Vincent Bennewe</strong></a> lived in the Albany area during the mid-eighteenth century. Although we might <a href="../../res/guess.html">guess</a> that he was descended from the family of <a href="pierreben.html">Pierre Bennewe</a>, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, a "Vincent Benoit" <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=PZsyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA86&lpg=RA1-PA86&dq=vincent+bennewe&source=bl&ots=t8ionV2Pz6&sig=QOTcDTeKKWlWPIR-OXDUSesGkCQ&hl=en&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBWoVChMI9Mq8yMOXyAIVDuKACh3BXwFi#v=onepage&q=vincent%20bennewe&f=false">appears</a> to have been christened in New York City in October 1733. 

<p>His wife appears to have been <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Antie Bovie. Their children were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1756 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=bennewe+genealogy&source=bl&ots=-_v7A4IY8r&sig=BvMip2T-gZC5LchS5WWFlkePCEY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCGoVChMIsNX58PCUyAIVhp-ACh14igNa#v=onepage&q=bennewe%20genealogy&f=false">and</a> 1757. The couple also sponsored family-based baptisms at the Albany church during the 1750s and 60s.

<p>In September 1765, the British army <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=B5EXGDwHk2sC&pg=PA85&dq=benneway&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI25C-1fmZyAIViXA-Ch1KhgJz#v=onepage&q=benneway&f=false">certified</a> the claim of "Vincent Benneway [or Benoit]" for movement from Albany to "Ft. George" in March of that year. Benneway signed a receipt for the same in May 1766 acknowledging payment of that account. [the father of the VB who was christened in NYC in 1733 was a carman]

<p>During the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">mid-1760s</a>, his property in the West <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> was assessed moderately. References ("Sent Bennewe") in those documents are variable in value and location. His holdings appear to have been located south of Albany city.
 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#vibe">1767</a>, he was identified as an enlisted man in the Albany-based <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company captained by Abraham C. Cuyler. This sketch is driven by this single city militia reference.

<p>After that, the name <a href="../../res/sp.html">Vincent Bennewe</a> has not been encountered in any sources consulted thus far. Past diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
