<strong>Catharina Veder/Veeder</strong></a> was born about 1740. She probably was the daughter of <a href="siveeder1095.html">Simon J.</a> and and Catharina Veeder. She grew up on the family farm located along the upper <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#nrmskl">Normanskill</a>. 


<p>In 1759, she married <a href="../g/joglen4934.html">John Glen, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Her children were christened at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.

<p>Early in their marriage, these Glens moved north to establish a village on the upper Hudson known as "Glens Falls." During that time, her name appeared among the principals in a number of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transactions involving Normanskill acreage  conducted by her husband.

<p>In March 1785, she was named in the <a href="../../wills/willsiveeder1095.html">will</a> filed by her father. John Glen, Jr. was chosen co-executor. 

<p>Catharina Veeder Glen died in October 1799 - a few months shy of her sixtieth birthday. Her husband lived until 1828.</p>
