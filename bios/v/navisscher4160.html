<P><a href="#sources"><b>Nanning Harmanse</b></a> was born during the 1660s. He was the Albany-born son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="habvisscher4064.html">Harmen Bastiaense</a> and <a href="../d/hesdircks6455.html">Hester Dircks</a>. As time passed, their large family would be known more widely by the surname "<a href="visscher.html">Visscher</a>."

<p>In January 1686, he married fur trader's daughter <a href="alvinhagen3415.html">Alida Vinhagen</a>. By 1705, ten children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.

<p>As the son of a large Albany family, his ambition to <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade for furs </a> caused him to venture far into the Indian country as a member of the <a href="../m/pamcgreg.html">Mc Gregorie Expedition</a> in 1687. Arrested and imprisoned by the French, after that he engaged in business from the safety of his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#149">home</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4160">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the King of England and signed a number of other community-based petitions as well.  


<p>Over the next three decades, he was an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4160">mainstay</a>. Prominately established on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> near the <a href="../../census1697.html#129">home</a> of his widowed mother, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> in 1708. In 1698, the city council granted his petition to erect a sawmill. In 1711, he was called "master" of the sloop <i>Mary</i>. He also <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#4160">served</a> in the militia and held land north of Albany in the <a href="../../na/kayad.html">Kayaderosseras Patent</a>.

<p>Living into his sixties, Nanning Harmanse Visscher died in April 1730 and was buried from the Albany church. His widow passed on in 1748.</p>
