<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Ariantie Visscher</B></A> was born in 1655. She was the daughter of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> carpenter Harmen Bastianse and Hester Dircks Visscher.</P>

          <p>Ariantie grew up in a large Albany family. She married her childhood neighbor,  shoemaker <a href="../w/jewendell2940.html">Jeronimus Wendell</a>. 
            Their first child was born in 1676. By 1689, she had delivered five more babies.</P>

          <p>Her husband died a few years later - leaving her use of his estate as long 
            as she remained a widow. Having reached middle age, Ariantie did not 
            re-marry. She continued to raise her children now as the <a href="../../census1697.html#004">head</a> 
            of a mainline Albany family. While four of those children grew into adulthood, she also continued to engage in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In 
            1695, she was the only woman listed on a petition of Albany merchants. In 1703, a court case against her for illegal trading launched the 
            legal career of her son, <a href="../w/evwendell2657.html">Evert Wendell</a> - who successfully defended her. By that <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4100">time</a>, she also owned a <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4100-2">second</a> Albany house and other real estate as well.</p>

<p>Ariantie Visscher Wendell lived to see all six children married and raising families of their own. Perhaps she was the Ariantie Wendell who was buried beneath the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> on December 19, 1741.</p>
