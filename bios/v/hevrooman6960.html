<P>Based on subsequent information, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry A. Vrooman</strong></a> was born prior to 1765. We seek to connect his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> to the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> Vroomans. He was known as Henry A. Vrooman to help prevent confusion with   same-named kin.

<p>Perhaps he was the son of Adam Vrooman of the Mohawk valley who was <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/vro_wem.html">christened</a> in Schenectady in December 1754. However, <a href="../../res/guess.html">other</a> birth senarios are possible and more than one "Henry A. Vrooman" may have lived in greater Albany County in the years following the War for Independence.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of Henry A. Vrooman was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1g9Qu5LmecEC&pg=PA301&lpg=PA301&dq=%22vrooman,+henry+a.%22&source=bl&ots=7nkowK7I4o&sig=QCE4a1tpkhZvoNhS8Rgo1YjdKqQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=chehUe_MAomRiQL6yYCYAg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22vrooman%2C%20henry%20a.%22&f=false">configured</a> on the census for <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.

<p>This individual appears to have been married but no children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> during his prime family years.

<p>Perhaps, he relocated to Albany during the early 1800s and became an innkeeper.
 
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the city census configured his household with four males and three females.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22vrooman+henry%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22vrooman%20henry%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first Albany directory identified Henry A. Vrooman as an innkeeper at 23 <a href="../../streets.html#pine">Pine Street</a>. After that, his name has not been found in the community-based record. 

<p>However, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> of "Henry A. Vrooman" appears to have passed probate in Albany in July of 1812.</p>
 
<p>With many historical <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> (not to mention at least one conflict) on this individual still without answers, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.
