<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Maria Vosburgh</strong></a> probably was born during the mid-1650s. She was the daughter of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> pioneers <a href="abpvosburgh.html">Abraham Pieterse</a> and <a href="../c/geercoey.html">Geertruy Coeymans</a> Vosburgh. However, her father was killed in 1659 leaving a widow and several small children to carry on in the <a href="../../art/art-bbpast.html">com</a>munity that became Albany in 1664.

<p>By the late 1670s, widow Geertruy had taken her family to the new settlement at <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> where these Vosburghs set down roots. The Vosburghs continued to hold property in Albany and Maria and her family were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In October 1689, Maria married Kinderhook resident Isaac Jans <a href="../va/valst.html">Van Alystyne</a> at the Albany church. Perhaps this first marriage for both partners produced only one child, a son christened in June 1695.

<p>This Van Alstyne family made its home in Kinderhook as well. An adult woman was not accounted for in the census of <a href="../../census1697.html#rw">R</a>ensselaerswyck households taken in <a href="../../census1697.html#isja">1697</a>. Maria would have been in her early forties at that time. However, two children were specified in the <a href="../../census.html">record</a>.

<p>Maria Vosburgh Van Alstyne was dead by February 1698 when her husband re-married. At that time, he was identified as the "widower of Marietje Vosburgh."
