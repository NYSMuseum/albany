<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Vosburgh</strong></a> was born in July 1720. He was the eldest son of <a href="abvosburgh6540.html">Abraham</a> and Geertie Vandenbergh Vosburgh. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a newcomer brickmaker. Before 1740, however, his father relocated the family to the <a href="../../na/hoos.html">H</a>oosick Valley. He sometimes was referred to as "Isaac A. Vosburgh."

<p>With his brother Willem, Isaac is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have taken over the operation of his father's <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> brick kiln.


<p>By 1748, he had married Catharina <a href="../vw/vwoert.html">Van Woert</a>. Four children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> before Catharina's death in April or May 1757. In January 1759, church records identified him as a widower when he married Catharina "Taat" (probably <a href="../s/staats.html">Staats</a>) of "East Camp." By 1775, six <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ga4/myhayes_family/f_28.html#2">more</a> children had been christened in Albany where both parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>Isaac Vosburgh was paid from the city treasury in July 1768. However, additional references to Isaac Vosburgh for mid-century have been scarce. 

<p>In 1766 and 67, the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West Manor</a> property of Isaac Vosburgh was accorded modest assessments.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#iv">1790</a> the Albany census configured the household of an Isaac Vosburgh in the first ward and that of another same-named individual in Watervliet. The assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, valued his property in the same Albany location.


<p>After 1799, the name of Isaac Vosburgh was no longer found in the commumity-based record <a href="../../inprog.html">thus far</a> encountered. With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, at this time we must move on.</p>
