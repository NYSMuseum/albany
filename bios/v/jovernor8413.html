      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Vernor</b></a> was born in October 1746. He 
        was the son of innkeepers <a href="jovernor.html">John</a> and <a href="mavernor8410.html">Martha 
        Vernor</a>. Losing his father during his childhood, he grew up helping 
        Martha Vernor operate her popular Southside tavern.</p>
      <p>In 1768, he married carpenter's daughter <a href="../vv/evvvlk1291.html">Eva 
        Van Valkenburgh</a>. The marriage produced three daughters. Eva was dead 
        by 1778 and their daughter, <a href="../v/mgtvernor2093.html">Margaret</a>, 
        was adopted by <a href="../t/jotayler.html">John Tayler</a> - the husband 
        of Eva's sister.</p>
      <p>Mentioned on the Albany assessment roll in 1766, John Vernor was a member 
        of the first ward <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a> 
        in 1767. During the Revolution, he served the American cause as <a href="#obit">"</a>deputy 
        commissary of military stores." In October 1775, he was appointed "Quartermaster" 
        for the Saratoga District. In March 1776, he was recommended to be commissioned 
        Adjutant of the Saratoga regiment. He was serving under the Quartermaster 
        General in <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#8413">August 1778</a>. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="more to come"></a> 
      <p>Although his mother and brother remained in Albany, John Vernor was living 
        in Stillwater in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. By 1810, he 
        had returned to Albany - living alone in a first ward home attended by 
        a single slave. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22vernor+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22vernor%20john%22&f=false">City directories</a> called him "deputy commissary" and located him at the "south end of Court" street.</p>
      <p>John Vernor died in December 1825 at age seventy-nine. At that time, 
        he was <a href="#obit">living</a> in North Albany!</p>
