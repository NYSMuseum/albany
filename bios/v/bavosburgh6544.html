<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent Vosburgh</strong></a> probably was born before 1740. At least <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=pete_witze&id=I01550">two</a> sets of <a href="abvosburgh6540.html">parents</a> seem plausible for him. He may have been born either in Kinderhook or Albany. Regardless, we believe his father was Abraham Vosburgh. 

<p>During the 1750s and afterward, a "Barent Voes Burgh" was a member of Captain John Winne's Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.


<p>In December 1760, Barent married "spinster" <a href="../g/angerr6545.html">Anna Gerritsen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Both partners were said to have been residents of the city of Albany.  By 1779, eight children had been christened in the Albany church.

<p>Except for a modest contribution for the relief of Ticonderoga in May 1775, his name has not been found in the records of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> Albany. However, in October 1779, he was among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YYjPr7Ht7d8C&pg=PA385&lpg=PA383&dq=%22barent+vosburgh%22&source=web&ots=k4xwi_iklB&sig=_gW2CLPQxpnnpqPQZmZ5RlZb6uA#v=onepage&q=%22barent20vosburgh%22&f=false">exempted</a> from military service as they were employed by storekeeper <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a>.

<p>During the mid-1760s, Barent's property in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> and on those of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West Manor</a> as well. In 
<a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6544">1779</a>, his third ward lot was assessed moderately. During those years, his account occasionally was paid from the city treasury. 

<p>In October <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334&dq=%22barent+vosbargh%22&source=bl&ots=jw1MUEl9iS&sig=D9Vf_3hOzTvUSSFuRUYtYM9dPoc&hl=en&ei=XizNTbiLKcnn0QHovdngDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22barent%20vosbargh%22&f=false">1781</a>, his account for one £1:16 was submitted to the city council for payment. After that, the name of Barent Vosburgh has not yet been <a href="../qqqq.html">found</a> in the community-based record.</p>
