<P><A href="#biography"><B>Elizabeth Vernor</B></A> was born about 1749. She was the daughter of Albany innkeepers <a href="jovernor.html">John</a> and <a href="mavernor8410.html">Martha Vernor</a>. Her parents probably emigrated from Northern Ireland to Pennsylvania and then settled in Albany where he father died when Elizabeth was a child.</P>

<P>Growing up serving at her parents' popular Southside establishment, she came into frequent contact with the stream of <a href="../../newcomers.html">new people</a> who came to Albany during and after the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. In 1766, she married upwardly mobile Scottish trader <a href="../../bios/h/rhenry8425.html">Robert Henry</a>. Over the next decade, the marriage produced at least five children who grew up in their home and store on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a>.</P>

 
<p>Elizabeth Vernor Henry died in the Spring of 1788. She had not reached her fiftieth birthday. She was the mother of a small but distinguished early Albany family that included two noted jurists.</p>
