<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John B. Visscher</strong></a> was born in September 1769. He was the son of <a href="barvisscher.html">Barent</a> and <a href="savisscher4170.html">Sara Visscher</a> Visscher. Thus, he would not have been named in the <a href="../../wills/willbarvisscher.html">will</a> filed by his father earlier in April. Barent was dead by 1785 when his will passed probate with widow Sara as the primary heir and executor. In all, John B. was one of at least six children born to his parents between the mid-1760s and 1776.

<p><a href="../../res/sp.html">C</a>alled John B. to distinguish him from a number of contemporary  <a href="../../res/sp.html">John Visschers</a>, this individual <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=%22john+b+visscher%22&source=bl&ots=aMHHNpMfsK&sig=fD7DPccpxbTyTZpsgQouC04mlKc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HTDKT4-CE4nw0gGUgo14&sqi=2&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20b%20visscher%22&f=false">appears</a> to have married one Geertruy <a href="../d/dunbar.html">Dunbar</a> who died in 1804. He then married Albany native <a href="../w/cawillett6904.html">Catherine Willett</a> with whom he had eight children between 1811 and 1825. After his just deceased father, the last born was named "John B. Visscher."

<p>Initially he lived for a time <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4170">under</a> the <a href="../../census1790.html#4170">household</a> of his widowed mother. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, he was named and his personal property valued under the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> property owned by his mother. However, in <a href="../../census1800.html#4153">1800</a>, the census for that location identified "John Fisher" as the principal and included an age-appropriate female and also a woman of his mother's age in that household. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, he also was assessed for a lot on <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a>. 

<p>Community-based resources of his time referred to this distinctively named mainliner variously as a "gentleman" and as a "painter." In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#4153">1808</a>, he was among those invited to a notable Albany funeral.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22visscher+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22visscher%20john%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory gave John Visscher's address as 41 Columbia and later as 34 Columbia Street. For the rest of the decade, the directory listed the principal at 61 <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia</a> as "Widow Visscher." The Columbia Street property ownership history later was <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/amasa-junius-parker/landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-kra/page-85-landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-kra.shtml">described</a> somewhat by Amasa Parker.

<p>In April 1825, the Albany newspaper reported John B. Visscher had died at age 56 and that he resided at the corner of Columbia Street and Middle Lane. In June, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">Letters</a> of administration were granted on his estate. His second wife survived until 1862.</p>
