<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham Pieterse</strong></a> is the <a href="../../nnd.html">pat</a>riarch of the <a href="vosburgh.html">Vosburgh</a> family of early Albany. He is said to have been born in Brabant in 1620 and was the son of Pieter Jacobs Vosburgh. 

<p>He is <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">believed</a> to have emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> in 1649 and to have settled in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> by August. Initially, he was engaged to perform renovations on the "Patroon's house". In April 1651, he leased a house and lot north of the "patroon's house" for 16 florins a year.
 
<p>His wife was <a href="../c/geercoey.html">Geertruy Coeymans</a> - the mother of at least four sons and a <a href="mavosburgh6559.html">daughter</a>. Some of their children became Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">res</a>idents.</p>

<p>He was known as a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who, in 1654, is said to have exported 1,500 beavers. He also was a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a> of some note.  

<p>In 1652, he was among the carpenters appointed to survey building lots in the area that soon would become the village of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>.  His most recent <a href="../../books.html#jv">bio</a>grapher believes that he may have had some European training in surveying although later he was taken to task and then dismissed for "faulty" surveying. He was among the recipients in the initial round of Beverwyck <a href="../../lists/list1650s.html">houselots distributed</a> beginning in 1652-54.

<p>In September 1656, he leased a mill (probably on the Wynantskill) along with Hans Jans from Rotterdam at the rate of 100 florins annually. In April 1659, the Beverwyck court noted that he was the first person to request permission to build a sawmill on the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a> and thus would have the right of first refusal.

<p>Abraham Pieterse Vosburgh is believed to have been killed by Indians in September 1659 during the so-called "Esopus War." By 1676, his widow had liquidated her late husband's property and, with at least <a href="pivosburgh.html">one</a> son, had acquired lands across the Hudson and then settled in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>.</p>
