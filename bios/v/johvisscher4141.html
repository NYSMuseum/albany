<P><A href="#biography"><B>Johannes Harmanse</B></A> was born in Albany during the late 1660s. He was the third son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers Harmen Bastian and Hester Dircks Visscher.</P>

<P>About 1695, he married soldier's daughter <a href="../n/elnottingham503.html">Elizabeth Nottingham</a>. Over the next seventeen years, the marriage produced eight children who were baptized at the Albany <A href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. By <a href="../../census1697.html#001">1697</a>, Johannes had a home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> near that of his parents. The landmark house at the corner of Steuben Street would remain a Visscher headquarters for the next hundred years.</P>

          <p>Like his father, Johannes Harmanse followed the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur 
            trade</a>. By 1710, he was counted among the most successful Albany 
            merchants. In 1702, he was elected assistant alderman for the second 
            ward. In 1712, he succeeded to the second ward alderman's seat. During 
            those years, he acquired more city property and also a leasehold on 
            a plantation at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 
          <p>During the <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> of 1713-44, Visscher <a href="../../inprog.html">branched-out</a> beyond his Albany base. During the 1720s, he acquired a house in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, some property downriver in Kingston, and participated in several frontier land grants. He also was granted permission to trade in the Indian country.</p>

<p>Johannes Harmanse Visscher was buried from the Albany Dutch church in April 1749. He was near his eightieth birthday. His widow lived another five years.</p>
