<P><a href="#sources"><b>Teunis Visscher</b></a> was born in April 1702. He was a middling child in the family Albany residents <a href="bavisscher4102.html">Bastiaan Harmanse</a> and 
<a href="../m/ditemet.html">Dirckje Teunis</a> Visscher. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> of Albany learning the art of <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewing</a> from his father.</p>

<p>In January 1727, Teunis married Albany native <a href="../l/maclansing3487.html">Machtelt Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> . By 1746, eight children had been christened in the church where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>For more than fifty years, he was a <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market</a> Street <a href="../../census1756.html#25">mainstay</a> whose brewery supplied beverages for Albany people and those of the countryside as well. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1733">1733</a> and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1740">1740</a>, he served as a firemaster. His name was included on rosters of qualified <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4174">voters</a>. He also owned additional lots south of the city and, with his <a href="havisscher4128.html">brother</a>, in the third ward. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">Ass</a>essment rolls for the second half of the eighteenth century (<a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4174">1779</a> & <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4174">1788</a>) valued his varied holdings moderately.</p>

<p>Teunis lost his wife in 1757 but continued on aided by six slaves in his household in <a href="../../census1790.html#4174">1790</a>. In his mid-seventies at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, his grandson, <a href="mavisscher4062.html">Matthew Visscher</a>, was a leading revolutionary operative.</p>  

<p>He <a href="../../res/guess.html">probably</a> was the Teunis Visscher whose simple <a href="../../doc/nn2.html#4174">death notice</a> appeared in an Albany newspaper in October 1794. Thus this mainliner would have lived for more than ninety-two years.</p>
