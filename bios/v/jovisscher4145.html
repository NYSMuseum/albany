      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Visscher</b></a> was born in April 1739. 
        He was a son in the large family of Albany natives <a href="jovisscher4142.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../s/anstaats4552.html">Anna Staats</a> Visscher. His father 
        died in 1749 and his mother re-married. In 1744, he was named an heir 
        in Johannes "Sr's." <a href="../../wills/willjovisscher4142.html">will</a>.</p>
      <p>In May 1763, he married <a href="../b/elizbradt4349.html">Elizabeth Bradt</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>. By 1782, eight 
        of their children had been baptized there where he was a member and longtime 
        pewholder.</p>
      <p>These Visschers set up their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>. He was a businessman who made his way through community-based 
        organizations - serving as firemaster and standing with his neighbors 
        in <a href="../../solconst.html#4145">opposition</a> to the Stamp Act 
        in 1766.</p>
		
<p>At that point in his life, a number of unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> dictate caution. Several prominent John Visschers are <a href="#sources">at risk</a> for 
        his lifetime. Thus, this profile is very much <a href="../../inprog.html">in-progress</a>! 
      <p>We believe that this John Visscher was a member and officer of the first 
        Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>. 
      <p>"Colonel" Johannes Visscher died in October 1821 at age eighty-five.</p>

        years is a challenging proposition!</font size></p>
