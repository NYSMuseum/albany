      <P>The story of the <a href="#sources"><strong>Vrooman</strong></a> family 
        of early Albany begins with the arrival of <a href="pivrooman6963.html">Pieter 
        Meese Vrooman</a> who settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
        and was among those present at the initial distribution of <a href="../../lists/list1650s.html">houselots</a> 
        during the 1650s. He is said to have been one of three brothers who emigrated 
        to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. Perhaps a brother named 
        <a href="jamvro6961.html">Jacob Meese</a> owned a houselot in Albany in 
        1681. However, Pieter Meese may have been the only Vrooman of his generation 
        to actually live in what became Albany. The family was more prominent 
        in the settlement of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        and its environs. 
<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6963">1679</a>, the name of "Pieter Meusen" was included on a census of Albany householders.

<p>However, none of the first settler Vroomans (Meesens) were represented on the Albany city or Manor censuses taken in <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a> as all three brothers had passed on. The descendants of the brother whose family <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~vanepsgenealogy/schmass.html">died</a> in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> in February 1690 were prominent in the rebuilding of that community in the decades that followed. By <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, nine Vrooman names appeared on a <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/census/1720indx.html">list</a> of freeholders in Schenectady.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, no Vrooman-named residences were included on a census of Albany householders made by the British army. 

<p>A decade <a href="../../sources.html#uny">later</a>, no city-based Vrooman households, but at least three in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck and many more in Schenectady and its environs, were valued on available assessment rolls.

<p>In March 1779, no Vrooman-named households appeared on the city assessment roll. At the same time, the list was certified by <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> Isaac Vrooman.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, no Vrooman-named households  were listed on the census for the city of Albany. However, eight family 
        residences were configured in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet"> 
        Watervliet</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, no Vrooman named households were left in the city. The first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22vrooman+%22innkeeper&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q&f=false">1813</a> listed only the residence of innkeeper <a href="hevrooman6960.html">Henry A. Vrooman</a>.

<p>After its first generations in Albany and its hinterland, the Vrooman family has spread across the United States where today the name is encountered in many <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Vrooman+history&start=10&hl=en&sa=N&tbo=u&rlz=1R2AURU_enUS500&tbm=isch&source=univ&ei=yIK7UKmrJNDK0AHhlYDACg&ved=0CEQQsAQ4Cg&biw=1600&bih=692">incarnations</a>.</p>
