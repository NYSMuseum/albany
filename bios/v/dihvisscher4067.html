<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">t</a>raditional sources, <a href="#sources"><b>Dirck Harmanse</b></a> was born (probably in America) in 1652. He was the son of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> <a href="habvisscher4064.html">Harmen Bastiaense</a> and <a href="../d/hesdircks6455.html">Hester Dircks</a> Visscher. He grew up in a large family that became well-established in Albany and its environs.</p>


<p>His wife was Jemmetie Jans. By 1698, a number of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Dirck Harmanse was a prominent <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a>, sawyer, and resident of the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1700, he served as firemaster and asessor. His house was listed on the census of <a href="../../census1679.html#4067">1679</a>. Located on the corner of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market</a> and what became Steuben Street (near the North gate of the stockade), it was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#082">landmark</a> for a half century. He also had a financial interest in a sloop, a second Albany house, and held external land as well. During the early 1700s, his Albany property was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessed</a> comparable to that of the community's most successful businessmen. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4067">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of qualified voters.

<p>In 1718, the <a href="../../wills/willkvr5054.html">will</a> of the patroon noted that Visscher was in possession of pastureland in the Manor.</p>

<p>Dirck Harmanse Visscher filed a <a href="../../wills/willdivisscher4067.html">will</a> in February 1712. It named his wife, son, and four living daughters. He died in February 1725 and was buried beneath the church.</p>
