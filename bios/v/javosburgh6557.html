<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Vosburgh</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> James or Jacobus) was born in March 1761. He was the son of <a href="isvosburgh6555.html">Isaac</a> and his second wife, Catharina <a href="../s/staats.html">S</a>taats Vosburgh. His father was at least a regional resident if not actually living in the city of Albany. This sketch focuses on the Albany resident "Jacobus Vosburgh" identified on the city census in <a href="../../census1800.html#6557">1800</a> and in other community-based resources.

<p>Coming of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">age</a> just before the end of the Revolutionary era, we would expect to find some <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">record</a> of his wartime activities. 

<p>He appears to have married an <a href="../qqqq.html">Anna Robison</a> during the 1780s. Between 1786 and 1801, their marriage had produced at least four children.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> and afterwards, his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> were valued moderately on the second ward assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#6557">1800</a>, his household included three young boys, a young girl, and two women. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, the city census charted the growth of that family.

<p>This Vosburgh home was either at or near the intersection of Pearl and Van Schaick Streets. Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22vosburgh+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22vosburgh%20james%22&f=false">1813</a>, city directories identified "James Vosburgh" as a grocer or/and a cartman and fixed his address at 50 or 52 on upper <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick</a> Street. A city roster also from 1813 <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22james+vosburgh%22&source=bl&ots=2iKzHUXA3x&sig=GYm49_qHNUJkv5CaZ6XSJPTidPI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZI_PT9qZFZKt0AHb6LH8Bw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22james%20vosburgh%22&f=false">identified</a> James Vosburgh as one of three "captains of the watch".

<p>After 1816, individuals perhaps named a <a href="../../res/sp.html">variant</a> of "Jacob Vosburgh" were listed in city directories (including up to 1830) at various locations on the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of the city. We have a number of <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding the family, spouse, later life, and passing of this early Albany personage.</p>
