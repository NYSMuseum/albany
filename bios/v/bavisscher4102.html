      <P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Bastian Harmense</strong></a> probably was born 
        within a few years of 1660. He may have been the fourth of seven <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/genealogicalnote00talc#page/254/mode/2up">sons</a> 
        of Albany residents <a href="habvisscher4064.html">Harmen Bastiaense</a> 
        and <a href="../d/hesdircks6455.html">Hester Dircks</a> Visscher. 
      <p>By 1684, he had married <a href="../m/ditemet.html">Dirckje Teunis</a>. By 1710, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a long time member and frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>Bastian Harmense was a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> whose <a href="../../census1697.html#100">home</a> was in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He served on juries and as a firemaster. He also was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4102">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in pledging allegiance to the king of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4102">1720</a>, his name was included on a roster of freeholders in the first ward. In 1702, his home was accorded a substantial assessment. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4102">1709</a>, two of his properties were considered on the city assessment roll. He also owned a <a href="../../wills/willjastaats.html">pasture</a> lot near the "<a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">old fort</a>."


<p>Bastian Harmense Visscher died in April 1737 and was buried from his church. In 1747, the property of his heirs was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">will</a> filed by Elbert Gerritse.</p>
