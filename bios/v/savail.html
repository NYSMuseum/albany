<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Vail</strong></a> appears to have been born in June 1766. He <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/samuel-vail_29143868">probably</a>  was a younger son in the large family of Aaron and Martha Ward <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/v/a/i/Robert-S-Vail-iii/GENE1-0008.html">Vail</a>. About that   time, his family moved up from Dutchess County to the Nassau area (today's Rensselaer County) where a younger brother was born in 1770. Samuel Vail's father was a well-known <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9WVbAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA5-PA68&lpg=RA5-PA68&dq=%22aaron+vail%22+ward&source=bl&ots=JgepDeMf8F&sig=Xxx5b64c52gh6UAeUTVQYdDEeDc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpq7nb9LDTAhUl74MKHQ7pAysQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=%22aaron%20vail%22%20ward&f=false">Quaker preacher</a>. One <a href="http://larseighner.com/webtrees/family.php?famid=F501&ged=probandlars">source noted</a> that his mother (born in 1724) was an Albany native and died there in 1812. However, we seek definitive  information on his specific <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>Perhaps, he was the "Samuel Vail" whose household was configured on the census for Rensselaerswyck in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. At that time, records show two men over sixteen as the sole occupants at that address. That location was <a href="http://mosesvail.blogspot.com/2016/03/moses-vail.html">said to be</a> on the Albany-Boston road and was near a number of other "Vail" households. All these Vails <a href="../../res/guess.html">appear</a> to have been <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22samuel+vail%22+quaker&spf=1">Qu</a>akers who had migrated from Dutchess County having previously lived on Long Island and/or in New Jersey.

<p>Samuel Vail's wife was Dutchess County native <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/siche-doughty_19622127">Siche Doughty</a>. Between 1791 and 1803, the marriage produced at least five children.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#sava">1800</a>, the census for the first ward in Albany configured the household of "Samuel <a href="../../res/sp.html">Veal</a>" with three children, a young adult male and an adult woman in Samuel's age bracket. Subsequent city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">censuses</a>, accounted for the development of his family.

<p>In <a href="#1804">1804</a>, his residence on "Washington St." is said to have boarded senators Chipman and Schenck.

<p>Beginning with the first city directory in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=%22samuel+vail%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=samuel%20vail&f=false">1813</a>, he was identified as a merchant at 81 Court then South Market Street. Later, that residence was said to have been on the corner of South Market and Division. At that time, <a href="../../sources.html#ad">dir</a>ectories showed that he held the municipal positions as weigher of fish and iron, and as the measurer of salt.

<p>He may have served as an "Adjutant" in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BC2trqrpnwUC&pg=PA475&lpg=PA475&dq=%22samuel+vail%22+albany&source=bl&ots=DWhGwaSzqE&sig=bB1L-FebN-Xzmg75HVfggkqhRN4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0kNX8sq7TAhUI24MKHb-LCyw4ChDoAQhAMAY#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20vail%22%20albany&f=false">1814</a>.
  
<p>On July 17, 1849, the Albany newspaper carried the simple note that "Samuel Vail <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MZUPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA353&lpg=PA353&dq=%22samuel+vail+died%22&source=bl&ots=fPcvbUdD_3&sig=Tfu7S_9AjChhwvrmesn0dccdf64&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEobKF3qvTAhXB7IMKHblGBVQQ6AEIOTAG#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20vail%20died%22&f=false">died</a>, aged 83."</p>
