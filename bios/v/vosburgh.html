<P>The story of the Albany <a href="#sources"> <strong>Vosburgh</strong></a> family begins with <a href="abpvosburgh.html">Abraham Pieterse</a> who settled in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck as early as 1649. The first Abraham Vosburgh held a number of properties. Following his untimely death in 1659, his <a href="../c/geercoey.html">widow</a> raised their three sons and at least one <a href="mavosburgh6559.html">daughter</a> in an <a href="../../census1679.html#11">Albany home</a> until they re-located to the new settlement at <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. Their children further established the Vosburgh family in Albany and its <a href="../../albanycounty.html">environs</a>.

<p>However, in <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, only the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck households of <a href="pivosburgh.html">Pieter</a> and Isaac Vosburgh were configured on the <a href="../../census1697.html#rw">census</a>.

<p>During the middle decades of the eighteenth century, eight Vosburgh named households were <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/kind/kinderhook_%201744_tax_list.htm">listed</a> on a <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, no Vosburgh-named households were noted on a census of 329 buildings in the city taken  for quartering purposes by the British army.

<p>During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">mid-1760s</a>, three individual Vosburghs were assessed on Albany assessment rolls.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6544">1779</a>, the names of  <a href="bavosburgh6544.html">Barent</a> and <a href="myvosburgh6561.html">Myndert</a> Vosburgh were included separately but placed near eachother on an Albany tax list.

<p>In 1790, only one <a href="../../census1790.html#iv">Vosburgh-named</a> household was configured on the city census. However, seven Vosburgh names were included on the <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">census</a> of surrounding Watervliet. By that time, the Kinderhook Vosburghs and Vosburgh outlyers as well were counted under newly formed Columbia County. Also, at that time, upwards or fifty Vosburgh-<a href="../../res/sp.html">named</a> households were listed in New York State.

<p>The Albany city census in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a> configured the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of "Jacobus" Vosburgh.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22vosburgh%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22vosburgh%22&f=false">1813</a>, only the Van Schaick Street residence of cartman James Vosburg represented the family in the first city directory.

<p>Since then, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=vosburgh&gs_sm=3&gs_upl=1113l2533l0l3031l8l6l0l2l2l0l183l667l4.2l8l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&biw=1440&bih=736&wrapid=tlif133027680045610&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=vmlKT7raKaLI0QHJ74iTDg">descendants</a> of the first Abraham and Geertruy have settled, <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?surname=vosburgh">grown</a>, and prospered <a href="http://names.whitepages.com/last/vosburgh">across</a> the United States.

<p>The Vosburgh family maintained a modest presence <a href="../../criteria.html">in</a> the city of Albany during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. However, the descendants of Abraham Pieterse were far more numerous in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.</p>
