<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Vinhagen</b></a> was born about 1680. She probably was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jadvinhagen3420.html">Jan Dirckse</a> and Maria Vinhagen.</p>


<p>At the end of November 1705, she married Albany native <a href="../r/myroseboom1950.html">Myndert Roseboom</a>. The wedding was performed at the "bride's parents house." By 1716, her five children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where her husband was a member and deacon.</p>

<p>Maria raised her family in a middling home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Her husband served the community as militiaman, firemaster, and constable before his untimely death in October 1722.</p> 

<p>Maria Vinhagen Roseboom lived much longer. She was listed as a householder on the <a href="../../census1756.html#3">census</a> taken in 1756. Her <a href="../r/alroseboom1534.html">daughter</a> married a future mayor of Albany in 1735. Maria was buried from the church by her son in February 1760. She would have been close to eighty years old.</p>
