<strong>Catharina Visscher</strong></a> was born in January 1771. She was the last child born to the marriage of Albany natives <a href="btvisscher4063.html">Bastian T.</a> and <a href="../vd/engvdb5777.html">Engeltie Vandenbergh</a> Visscher. She grew up in a brewer's home on Pearl Street and on Visscher's farm located <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">outside</a> the city.


<p>In January  1789, she was just eighteen years old and thus needed her parents consent to marry Albany native <a href="../b/isbogert6106.html">Isaac H. Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Her daughter was born at the end of December. By 1809, the marriage may have produced two or more children. She later became a member of the <a href="../../drc.html#second">Second</a> Reformed church.

<p>We believe these Bogerts lived with family members (either the <a href="../../census1790.html#6097">Bogerts</a> or the <a href="../../census1790.html#4063">Visschers</a>) during the first years of their marriage. 


<p>Between 1788 and 1813, her husband's name is mostly absent from Albany rolls. He may have left Albany during this time. &nbsp; <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="Perhaps she followed her husband to New York"></a> &nbsp; By 1813, they had settled in along the Albany waterfront where they remained for the next three decades.

<p>In December 1801, Catharina freed the recently born baby daughter of her slave, "Dean" as recorded by an Albany court.
 

<p>Catharina Visscher Bogert lost her husband in 1841. She died in April 1845 at the age of seventy-six.</p>
