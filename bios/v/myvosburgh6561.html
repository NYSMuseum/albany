<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Myndert Vosburgh</strong></a> was an 
        Albany resident during the 1760s and 70s. Perhaps, he was the Myndert 
        <a href="../../drc.html">christened</a> in Albany to Barent and Jannetie 
        [Van Schaack] Vosburgh in February 1726. His name otherwise has not been found in the extant Albany church records.
		 
      <p>In October 1761, a Myndert Vosburgh (identified as a tailor) witnessed 
        a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA462&lpg=PA462&dq=myndert+vosburgh+tailor&source=bl&ots=4RFi_zlW-Q&sig=70H7ZQCYxQ1ErhIe9g-cJunVg9U&hl=en&ei=soagTdS1N8X30gHj49TgBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=myndert%20vosburgh%20tailor&f=false">will</a> 
        along with two prominent Albany residents. 
      <p>This individual does not <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/contributionsfor00pearuoft#page/151/mode/2up">seem</a> 
        to have married. However, his name was associated with Barent Vosburgh 
        on Albany assessment rolls and two "Mynderts" were baptized to Barent 
        and Anna Gerritsen during the 1770s. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a>, he was appointed constable 
        for the third ward and high constable as well. In that year, his Albany 
        property received a modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> 
        as did that of Barent Vosburgh whose name appeared below that of Myndert. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#6561">1767</a>, he also was identified as a member of a city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        regiment</a>. 
      <p>His name has not been found in the <a href="../../coc.html">records</a> 
        of Albany during the War for Independence. 
<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6561">1779</a>, his personal property 
        was assessed under a lot in the third ward. After that, his name longer appeared on Albany rolls.
		 
      <p>However, other same-named contemporaries lived in Albany County. In December 1767, 
        a marriage <a href="http://searches2.rootsweb.com/th/read/WHEELER/2005-11/1131081071">license</a> 
        was issued to Myndert Vosburgh and "Syntiche" Wheeler. Another Myndert 
        Vosburgh <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fw4oyw6xgyUC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%22myndert+vosburgh%22&source=bl&ots=1PejBZ5wTt&sig=ZyNJpvCTthiya-eKE03VcEeMGp8&hl=en&ei=4nygTdiuIoTMgQfO84HaBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&q=%22myndert%20vosburgh%22&f=false">was</a> 
        a prominent <a href="http://www.e-familytree.net/f16723.htm">resident</a> 
        of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> during the 1770s and afterward. 
      <p>At this point, unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> prompt 
        us to move on from the life of the one-time Albany resident named Myndert 
        Vosburgh.</p>
