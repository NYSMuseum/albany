<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sebastian Visscher</strong></a> was born in March 1773. He was the son of Albany stalwarts <a href="mavisscher4062.html">Matthew</a> and <a href="../f/lyfryer2220.html">Lydia Fryer</a> Visscher. His father, a city political icon, died when Sebastian was not yet twenty leaving widow Lydia as head of the stately Pearl Street home until her death in 1840.

<p>In November 1784, "Bastian" was <a href="../../wills/willjofryer.html">willed</a> a silver watch by his grandfather. However, he would be known in the community as "Sebastian" and sometimes "Colonel Sebastian Visscher."

<p>In September 1791, he was confirmed "Bastian Fisher" in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. His wife was a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Pr</a>esbyterian church. He appears to have been a member of St. Peter's.


<p>In October 1797, he is said to have married <a href="../s/roshipboy.html">Rosanna Shipboy</a> - the daughter of a newcomer <a href="../irish.html">Sc</a>ottish merchant. The marriage <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/genealogicalnote00talc#page/262/mode/1up">may</a> have produced seven children. Only two daughters lived to maturity.

<p>These Visschers made their home on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> in the first ward. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward property was valued on the assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#4172">1800</a>, his household included two children.

<p>After burying his forty-two-year-old father in August, in November 1793, this eldest son was faced with a catastrophic situation when their slave <a href="../slave/pomp.html">Pomp</a> was implicated in an arson <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> that destroyed a significant part of the old city.

<p>Like his father, Sebastian Visscher was an <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a>. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6YehIsw-eF8C&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&dq=%22sebastian+visscher%22+shipboy&source=bl&ots=q_eoDNX_m3&sig=tPTeOQhVdqn96eTNGkL8JMnUcKI&hl=en&ei=IIPWTfGgAejX0QHJkq2VBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22sebastian%20visscher%22%20shipboy&f=false">said</a> to have been admitted to practice in February 1795; made master of chancery in 1812; justice of the peace; clerk of the court of errors; and clerk of the NYS Senate. He was colonel of the Eighth militia regiment. He was an officer and member of a number of civic organizations.

<p>Apparently, his father was the holder of many <a href="../../res/realestate.html">parcels</a> within the less settled parts of the city. Immediately following Matthew Visscher's death, Sebastian liquidated many of those holdings. During the early 1800s, he "purchased a number of lots (ranging from 40 to 140 acres) at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> from the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> government.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#4172">1808</a>, he was among those worthies invited to an Albany funeral.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22visscher+sebastian%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22visscher%20sebastian%22&f=false">1813</a>, city directories identified his seat as 96 State Street. 

<p>In 1818, he was named assessor. In 1819, he was elected alderman for the first ward.

<p>Sebastian Visscher, Esq. died in October 1824 at the age of fifty-two. He was buried from his home at 100 North Pearl Street.</p>
