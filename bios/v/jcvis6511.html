<strong>Jan Cornelisse</strong></a> probably was born before 1620. He sailed from Amsterdam to New Amsterdam in <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/shha2.html">1639</a>. Quickly, he moved upriver to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and established himself in or near the settlement at <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>/Albany. He was known by the surnames "Viselaer" and "Gouw." 

<p>He was <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">said</a> to be a master carpenter with other tradesmen under his charge. He seems to have worked for the Van Rensselaers - building a church and submitting accounts covering the years 1639 to 1647.

<p>Over the next decades, he seems to have lived in the area around Albany - engaging in carpentry, <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6511"> trading</a>, and other activities. He appeared more often than regularly before the <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">Albany court</a> on a variety of matters. He was involved in lawsuits and in physical altercations. In 1675, he was identifed as the co-owner of a mill on the Poestenkill.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#26">1679</a>, he was called "Jan Gaw" and identified as an Albany householder. A few years later, he was identified as a supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps he was a bachelor.  

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#6511">1684</a>, he owed back taxes. <a href="../../sources.html#cma">Court minutes</a> from 1685 stated that he had served as a roadmaster, weighmaster, and juror. Over the next two decades, he was an appraiser and performed other chores for the Albany government. In 1693, he was called a "firewarden."

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#072">1697</a>, the city census placed him alone in an Albany house. Two years later, he joined with his neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6511">swearing</a> an oath of allegiance to the king of England.

<p>Jan Cornelisse Viselaer was last heard from in November 1702 when he was appointed fire and "way" master for the next year.</p>

The life of Jan Cornelisse Viselaer is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6511. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. At this point, we have not been able to place this apparently long-lived character in a family context. Thus, we seek information on his background and passing.
