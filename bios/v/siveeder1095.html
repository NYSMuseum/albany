<strong>Simon J. Veeder</strong></a> probably was born during the 1720s. Several same-named sons of Johannes were baptized in Albany County around that time.

<p>In April 1752, he married Catharina Veeder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1760, four children had been christened there where both parents were pewholders.<p>

<P>Bolstered by an bequest he received from the <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6222.html">estate</a> of Lucas Wyngaert during the 1750s, these Veeders appear to have taken over a farm on the <a href="#nmskl">Upper Normanskill</a> where they raised their family.

<p>In March 1785, Simon J. Veeder filed his <a href="../../wills/willsiveeder1095.html">will</a>. His wife was dead so he left his estate consisting of his farm on the Normanskill, lots in Albany, slaves, and other properties and possessions to his two living sons and daughter. He was dead by June 1787 when the will passed probate.</p>
