<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Harmen Bastiaense Visscher</strong></a> was born in Holland about 1619. He emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and established the <a href="visscher.html">Visscher</a> family in Albany and its environs. 

<p>Harme Bastiaense was known as a carpenter and was in New Amsterdam as early as 1649. He migrated north to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he signed a petition in <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#4064">1660</a> asking for more latitude in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In 1666, he was identified as a surveyor in Albany. About that time, he married <a href="../d/hesdircks6455.html">Hester Dircks</a>. They raised a large family and were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#127">1679</a>, he was included on a list of Albany householders. During the 1660s-80s, he owned a number of Albany properties including a house on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> and a garden plot along the river.   
 
<p> Harmen Bastiaense Visscher lived into his seventies. He was dead by 1697 when his widow was identified as the head of their <a href="../../census1697.html#129">Albany household</a>.
