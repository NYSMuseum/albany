<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John T. Visscher</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Fisher) was born in December 1746. He was the last child <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6YehIsw-eF8C&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=%22john+t.%22+visscher&source=bl&ots=qZnqCWW_r0&sig=zI3o7S3m9eOKJHnfYECkdaoD1ds&hl=en&ei=V0ZcTfG7BYL78AaD_YCZDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20t.%22%20visscher&f=false">born</a> to the marriage of <a href="tevisscher4174.html">Teunis</a> and <a href="../l/maclansing3487.html">Machtelt Lansing</a> Visscher. He grew up in the large <a href="../../census1756.html#25">fam</a>ily of a <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> brewer. He was consistently known as "John T." to prevent confusion with his slightly older and same-named <a href="jovisscher4145.html">kinsman</a>.

<p>In October 1767, he married Schenectady native <a href="../p/anpearse.html">Anna Pearse</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1783, seven children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In 1766, he (John <a href="../../res/sp.html">J.</a> Fisher) was among the Albany men who signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#4144">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty. In that year, his name first <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">appeared</a> on an Albany assessment roll. We seek documentation on where his family was living during the 1770s and early 80s. However, during those years, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#4144">Masonic lodge</a>.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, the twenty-nine-year-old John T. Visscher continued his support of the Patriot cause with financial and supply backing. He served in the commissary department and was <a href="../qqqq.html">said</a> to have been a lieutenant in William Hun's militia regiment.

<p>In May 1781, he posted a bond with the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> - guaranteeing his availability and residence within the county. At that time he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5vm7k0yfMesC&pg=PA713&lpg=PA713&dq=%22john+t+vischer%22&source=bl&ots=uIKakmxj5z&sig=rhqzaONlYWvjU56ZTF6H-IhblgE&hl=en&ei=6AFcTYvaLo31gAeY75j9DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20t%20vischer%22&f=false">id</a>entified as a yeoman of Albany. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4144">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. His pension application from 1832, fleshes out his service.

<p>After the war, he re-located to his rented lands in the Albany tract at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a> where he lived for the remainder of his life.

<p>In 1790, he was chosen to represent Montgomery County in the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>.


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his household in the Montgomery County town of Mohawk included eight family members and three slaves.

<p>It appears that he maintained a long term association with the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. As late as <a href="http://montgomery.nygenweb.net/regiments/earlymilitias.html">1809</a>, he was identified as colonel and then brigadier general of a Montgomery County regiment. 

<p>In September 1832, John T. Visscher was <a href="#pen">deposed</a> when applying for a pension for Revolutionary War service. He stated that he was 87 years-old and was living in Fort Hunter. This Albany native died sometime thereafter.</p>
