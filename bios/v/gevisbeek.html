<strong>Gerrit Visbeek</strong></a> (<a href="#sp">*</a>Verbeek) was the master of a ship on the Hudson River. Perhaps he was the "Gerrit Verbeek" who <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/shscow2.html">arrived</a> in New Netherland from Amsterdam in the summer of 1663. In July 1664, he was said to have delivered a note from the director of New Netherland to the "river Indians." 

<p>Following the death of <a href="../vh/jfvh776.html">Jan F. Van Hoesen</a> about 1665, Visbeek married Volckie Van Noorstrant, Van Hoesen's widow and heir. That estate included substantial acreage in Albany and beyond. Visbeek's marriage to her almost certainly was childless.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#83">1679</a>, his name was included among Albany householders. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#gv">1684</a>, he owed back taxes. 

<p>During the late 1660s and 1680s, Visbeek sold several parcels of land in Albany and beyond - probably that had been left to his wife. In 1694, the Visbeeks made an agreement with Volckie's son regarding disposition of some of the estate. Volckie was dead by July 1703 when her will passed probate. Gerrit probably was deceased as well.</p>
