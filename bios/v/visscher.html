<P><a href="#spelling">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, the <a href="#sources"><b>Visscher</b></a> family was prominent in early Albany. It is descended from <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="habvisscher4064.html">Harmen Bastiaense</a> and <a href="../d/hesdircks6455.html">Hester Dircks</a> who raised a large family in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and then <a href="../../earlycity.html">Albany</a>.</p>

<p>Five sons: <a href="johvisscher4141.html">Johannes</a>, <a href="bavisscher4102.html">Bastiaen</a>, 
        <a href="navisscher4160.html">Nanning</a>, <a href="frhvisscher4069.html">Frederic</a>, 
        and <a href="dihvisscher4067.html">Dirck</a> (each known by the patronymic 
        "<a href="#spelling">Harmense</a>" until after 1700) became Albany residents. Their <a href="arvisscher4100.html">sister</a> 
        married Evert Wendell. Each of these prominent Albany households was accounted 
        for on the census taken in <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>. At 
        the same time, the offspring of that generation permanently established 
        the family in Albany and its hinterland.</p>

<p>In 1742, four Visscher men were identified as <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1674">freeholders</a> 
        and living in the third ward. 
<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, a census taken by the British army identified seven "Fischer" households within the city. A citywide assemment roll taken in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">March 1779</a>, identified twelve Visscher-owned properties with five of them naming Visscher widows as the principal of record. Now known in Albany as "Visscher," those numbers respresented high points for the family in Albany.</p>
		
		
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, three Visscher-named households were listed on the census for the city of Albany. Five were configured 
        on that census in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>. 
        The promising public career of <a href="mavisscher4062.html">Matthew Visscher</a> 
        was cut short by his death in 1793 at the age of forty-two. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22visscher+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22visscher%20james%22&f=false">1813</a>, 
        four Visscher-named households remained in the city. Chief among these 
        was the State Street home of <a href="sebvisscher.html">Sebastian Visscher</a>, an attorney and jurist 
        and that of his mother, widow <a href="../f/lyfryer2220.html">Lydia Fryer</a> 
        Visscher who lived at 100 North Pearl Street until her death in 1841.</p>

<p>A large number of descendants appearing in local phone books and using a variety of spellings, testify to the vitality of the Visscher family today. The name of the Mohawk river landing called "<a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/vischer's_ferry.htm">Vischer's Ferry</a>," also recalls this important early Albany family.</p>

        on the Visscher family is informed chiefly by <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. At this point, 
        the standard and enduring <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/genealogicalnote00talc#page/252/mode/2up">online 
        resource</a> on the family was compiled (<a href="http://openlibrary.org/books/OL6941643M/Genealogical_notes_of_New_York_and_New_England_families">published</a> 
        in 1883) by descendant Sebastian Visscher Talcott (1812-1888). Still worthwhile 
        is the genealogy compiled by <a href="../r/cureynolds.html">Cuyler Reynolds</a> 
        a century ago and now <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/rankin.html#visscher">online</a> from the Schenectady Digital History archive. See also, <a href="http://threerivershms.com/simmsvisscher.htm">Three Rivers</a> for its extension into the Mohawk Valley.

        <p><a name=spelling></a><b>Variants:</b> Just too many to even list, flexibility 
          is a key attribute in searching for family members within the historical 
          record. But be sensitive to Fisher, Visger, and those called Harmanse 
          and Bastiaense!</p>
