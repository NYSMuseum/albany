<P>According to <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=wolphert&id=I248625">family</a>-based resources, <a href="#sources"><strong>Christina Voorhees</strong></a> was born in June 1774. At this point, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">offer</a> that she was the daughter of John Voorhees of New Jersey.

<p>In August 1971, the bride was called "Miss" Christina Voorhees when she <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/church/flatbush_mar1.shtml">married</a> one <a href="../l/abdlansing.html">Abraham D. Lansing</a> in New Brunswick, New Jersey but under the auspices of the Flatbush Reformed Church in Kings County (Brooklyn). <a href="../qqqq.html">If</a> family-based birth resources are correct, the couple may have been in their mid-teens at the time of their marriage.

<p>However, we do know that the marriage produced at least three children. A number of <a href="../l/abdlansing.html#events">events</a> involving her appear in the records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> beginning during the 1790s. A daughter was christened in Albany in 1802.

<p>This Lansing family <a href="../../census1800.html#abdl">settled</a> in Albany where Abraham was in business and enjoyed the support of numerous <a href="../l/lansing.html">Lansing</a> kin. Christina's family was numerous as well but located mostly in New Jersey and downriver New York. 

<p>Her marriage ended when Abraham D. Lansing died after contracting a fever at the end of September 1805.

<p>Christina Voorhees Lansing is said to have died in December 1816. Perhaps, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on her estate in Albany in September 1817. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> more definitive information on her later life and passing. Thus, she would have lived only forty-two years. </p>
