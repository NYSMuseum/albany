      <P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">so</a>urces, 
        <a href="#sources"><strong>Jan Verbeek</strong></a> was born in Breda 
        about 1612. 
      <p>He is <a href="http://www.noren.com/genealogy/g054.html">said</a> to 
        have married the widow Maycke Damen Vissenburgh in Holland in 1641. He 
        emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> with his wife 
        and child about 1642. Little else has been said about his family. 
      <p>After a time on Manhattan, he moved upriver to take up residence in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
        In 1651, he sat on the colony's <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a>. 
        In 1658, his house in Greenbush was taken over by Jan Baptiste Van Rensselaer. 
      <p>Previously, he had moved across the river and was living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
        at the initial distribution of <a href="../../lists/list1650s.html">houselots</a> 
        in 1653. 
      <p>Verbeek was a licensed tailor and <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        estate</a> trader. Although he may have been overlooked on earlier survey 
        documents, he was listed as alone in an Albany house on the census of 
        <a href="../../census1697.html#045">1697</a>. 
      <p>Jan Verbeek was dead by 1699 when the state of his estate was of some 
        concern to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a>.</p>
