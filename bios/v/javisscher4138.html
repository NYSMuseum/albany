<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Dirckse Visscher</b></a> was born before 1683. He was the son of <a href="dihvisscher4067.html">Dirck Harmanse</a> and Jemmetie Jans Visscher. He was identified as the eldest son in the <a href="../../wills/willdivisscher4067.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1712.</p>


<p>He married <a href="../e/suegberts4540.html">Susanna Egberts</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in June 1709. The marriage appears to have been childless but he was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor at the Albany church.</p>

<p>He was a prominent Albany personage, a property holder, member of a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> troop, <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4138">voter</a>, and served as firemaster and then alderman in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He performed some <a href="../../corporation.html">contract work</a> for the city of Albany. In <a href="../../census1756.html#304">1756</a>, his home was configured on an inventory of householders made by the British army.</p>

<p>Jacob Dirckse Visscher lost his wife in 1761. In 1762, he filed a <a href="../../wills/willjavisscher4138.html">will</a> which divided his estate among several people and freed a "Negro man and woman." He died in October 1763 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
