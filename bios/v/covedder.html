<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously,  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Corset Vedder</strong></a> probably was born during the 1680s. He may have been the fifth son born into the large family of the <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> emigre&acute, <a href="../../beverwyck.html">B</a>everwyck resident, and Schenectady <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/index.html">patentee</a> called <a href="havedder6747.html">Harmen Albertse</a>.

      <p>His father held several residences (including in <a href="../../census1679.html#141">Albany</a>) 
        and traveled to Europe as well. Thus, fixing a more precise childhood home 
        for his children has proven more challenging than expected. However, <a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>arme 
        Vedder was more closely connected to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        and its environs. 
      <p>In March 1709, he married <a href="../b/mgtbarret7227.html">Margarita Berrit</a> of Albany at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She died prior to the baptism of her first child. In March 1711, Corset married "<a href="../c/cochristian.html">Neeltie Christians</a>" of <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canastigione</a> also at the Albany church. Over the next eleven years, at least three children (<a href="http://www.familyorigins.com/users/b/e/n/Robert-B-Bennett/FAMO4-0001/d362.htm">maybe</a> as many as six) were born to the second marriage.

<p>In 1711, he was identified as a widower and was living at <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. As early as 1708, he was interested in obtaining a "plantation" at Schaghticoke. Over the next decade, city records <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=corest+vedder&source=bl&ots=2hQsH0Wu8v&sig=4lD0C0XQmnOdYuxMcStv5XnGIGE&hl=en&ei=FJgDTZmEBoL_8Abz5YjnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=corset&f=false">chronicle</a> the formalization of that transaction. In 1720, he was identified as a freeholder of <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pPA5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA465&lpg=PA465&dq=%22corset+veder%22&source=bl&ots=rM7vylFnve&sig=5483I5t5nKy9PxMEwldqv3zeXTU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sr3sU8qaFYzhoATPwoDgDg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22corset%20veder%22&f=false">1715</a>, his name appeared on a roster of a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company composed of men from the Halfmoon area. 

<p>In April 1721, Albany city records noted his exchange of land at Schaghticoke with John Christianse and its subsequent sale to John Groesbeck for &pound;120.

<p>Corset Vedder is <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/vedder_c.html">said</a> to have made his will on October 25, 1745. He was dead by 1748. Except for a possible childhood home, this distinctively named individual probably did not live within Albany's <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a>.</p>
