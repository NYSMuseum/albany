<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hester Visscher</b></a> probably was born about 1680. She was the daughter of <a href="dihvisscher4067.html">Dirck Harmanse</a> and Jemmetie Visscher. This older daughter of a fur trader grew up in a large family in Albany's third ward.</p>

<p>In November 1702, she married Schenectady Massacre survivor <a href="../s/coswitts5654.html">Cornelis Swits</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1719, eight of their children had been baptized in Albany. Over the next decades, she would bury a number of her offspring in the church cemetery.</p>

<p>Her family also lived in the third ward from where Cornelis operated a sloop that belonged to her father. Over the next half century, Hester's family was a beneficiary of the estates of her <a href="../../wills/willdivisscher4067.html">father</a> and <a href="javisscher4138.html">brother</a>.</p>

<p>Cornelis Switts probably died during the 1730s or 40s. Known as "<a href="../../census1756.html#315">Widow Ester Swits</a>," she carried on in their <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> home for many years. In 1749, city records identified her as the owner of a plot of land in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Hester Visscher Switts died  in November 1757.
<p>In November 1762, her children were listed the <a href="../../wills/willjavisscher4138.html">will</a> filed by her brother.</p>
