<P><a href="#sources"><b>Frederick Harmanse Visscher</b></a> probably was born during the 1660s. He was a younger son of Albany residents and <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers Harman Bastiaense and Hester Dircks Visscher.</p>

<p>He followed his father and older brothers into the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> which sent him into the Indian country where he was taken prisoner by the French. By <a href="../../census1697.html#049">1697</a>, he was an established Albany merchant and was raising a family. Assessment rolls point to a moderate degree of wealth. He also stood with his neighbors in support of <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4069">petitions</a> sent to the provincial government.</p>   

<p>In 1692, he married Margarita Hanse. Following her death, he married the widow <a href="../s/elsanders1416.html">Elizabeth Sanders</a> Wendell in January 1706. By 1709, the two marriages had produced seven children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a deacon and frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>, he became an Albany mainstay - serving as juror, assessor, and firemaster. In 1715, he was an ensign in a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In that year, he also owned a mill on the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>.</p>
 
<p>He was still living when his second wife died in 1739.</p>
