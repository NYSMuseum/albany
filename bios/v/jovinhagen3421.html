<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Vinhagen</b></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="jadvinhagen3420.html">Jan Dirckse</a> and Maria Vanderpoel Vinhagen.</p>


<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#153">1697</a>, he was accounted for as an adult in the household of his father. Two years later, his signature appeared on an community-based <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3421">document</a> swearing allegiance to the king of England. At that time, his father was identified as an alderman. Thereafter, Johannes's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home was listed on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment</a> rolls.</p>

<p>He married <a href="../vt/mavtricht6604.html">Maria Van Tricht</a> in March 1706. The marriage produced seven children - three of whom married members of the Vandenbergh family.</p>

<p>In 1706, Johannes served as high constable for the city of Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3421">1709</a>, he was appointed firemaster in the second ward. He also served as an appraiser, juror, and surveyor. In 1715, he petitioned the city government to repair his street. In 1720, his name was on the list of qualified <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3421">freeholders</a>.</p>  

<p>Johannes Vinhagen may have lived another thirty years - although his name dropped from community rolls after 1720. Johannes Vinhagen died in October 1750 and was buried "near his house." With his death, the Vinhagen name disappeared from Albany - although Vinhagens continued to reside in the surrounding <a href="../../albanycounty.html">countryside</a>.</p>
