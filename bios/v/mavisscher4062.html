He was the first child born to the marriage of Albany contractor and landholder <a href="btvisscher4063.html">Bastian T. Visscher</a> and 
        his wife, <a href="../vd/engvdb5777.html">Engeltie Vandenbergh</a> Visscher. He grew up in the Pearl Street home that he would occupy after his father <a href="../../census1790.html#4063">moved</a> farther into the countryside.</p>
      <p>In 1772, he married sloop captain's daughter <a href="../f/lyfryer2220.html">Lydia 
        Fryer</a>. Their children were baptized in Albany churches during the 
        1770s and 80s. He was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        Reformed church</a>.</p>
      <p>Before the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olution, he had become licensed to practice <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>. He came 
        of age just in time to join the grassroots opposition to British restrictions 
        headed by his mentor, attorney and former alderman <a href="../y/ayjr.html">Abraham 
        Yates, Jr</a>. He also joined the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic 
        lodge</a> where he became acquainted with Albany newcomers who had more 
        <a href="../../friends.html">in common</a> with the royal establishment.</p>
      <p>But, instead, Matthew Visscher became a <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Revolutionary</a> 
        stalwart. In May 1775, he was appointed a lieutenant in the city militia 
        regiment. Shortly thereafter, he was named secretary of the "Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a>, Safety, and Protection" and was one of its stalwart 
        members throughout the war years. <img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigmvisscher.jpg"  alt="signature of Matthew Visscher" width=200 vspace=1 hspace=1 align=left border=0> 
        His daily diligence helped the committee bring the Revolution home and, 
        in the process, made the young man one of the most important local operatives. 
        He was a member of the Albany Commissioner for Detecting and Defeating 
        Conspiracies throughout its lifetime. He also served as an Indian Commissioner 
        - attending meetings on the frontier in the waning years of the war. In 
        these capacities, he forged lasting relationships with Governor George 
        Clinton and other members of his administration. In the years that followed, 
        Visscher received a number of <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty rights</a> 
        for wartime service in the military and on the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">homefront</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1778, he was elected assistant alderman for the first ward. He served 
        for more than a decade and was one of the most active members of the city 
        council. In 1778, he was appointed Albany City and County clerk and served 
        until 1790. In 1784, he was elected to the New York State Assembly and 
        served two terms. He also sat on a number of local boards and on the State 
        Board of Regents.</p>

        living for a while in the first ward <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4062">home</A> 
        of his father-in-law, by <a href="../../census1790.html#4062">1790</a>, 
        his family was established in their new, Georgian townhouse at what became 
        100 North <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl</a> Street. His service 
        as clerk and secretary of many organizations make Visscher's signature 
        among the most recognizable early Albany autographs.</p>
<p>Matthew Visscher died on August 8, 1793 at the age of forty-two. His estate passed probate in January 1794. His widow lived on in their "new" Pearl Street home until her death in 1841. A <a href="#obit">newspaper obituary</a> testified 
        to his exemplary service! Afterwards, his <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=78436930">headstone</a> was set at <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.</p>
