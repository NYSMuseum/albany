<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Harman B. Visscher</strong></a> was born in November 1700. He was the son of <a href="bavisscher4102.html">Bastian H.</a> and Dirkie Teunis Visscher. He sometimes was known as Harman B. Visscher. He grew up in a large family in the home of a prominent brewer and first ward mainstay who survived until 1737. He <a href="#will">would have</a> shared in his father's real property holdings in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">south</a>ern part of the city.

<p>In August 1731, he married the younger Albany native <a href="../w/sawyn6231.html">Sara Wyngaert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1752, eight <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA259&lpg=PA259&dq=%22harmen+b.+visscher%22&source=bl&ots=aMECJmR9tM&sig=mTGJt2tEeUdY1FVZOHbabC-33gk&hl=en&ei=6KKtTe_bH5PfgQfehoGUDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&sqi=2&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22harmen%20b.%20visscher%22&f=false">children</a> had been christened at the church where he was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4128">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of freeholders living in the third ward. However, his name was not included among the Albany freeholders identified in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a>.

<p>In the absence of defining economic information, perhaps Harman was a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> like his father and brother.

<p>Assessment rolls for the mid-<a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, valued his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> house and property substantially. His adult sons were also included (but not named) under their father's assessment. At that time, he also held a lot in the first ward (near the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Be</a>averkill) with his brother <a href="tevisscher4174.html">Teunis</a> - a prominent brewer. Another lot owned by the brothers along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Fo</a>xes Creek was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=%22harma+%22visher&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22harma%20visher%22&f=false">referenced</a> by the city corporation in March 1768.

<p>During a city council investigation of an election in October 1773, the board <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254&dq=harma+visscher&source=bl&ots=wxdF9Ttdny&sig=cquos7uIwRgdhfER6_iSJdB0o_c&hl=en&ei=bbytTc7GKYTdgQea_vnrCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=harma%20visscher&f=false">ruled</a> that "the House where Harma Visscher lately lived is situated in the third ward." 

<p>Therefore, Harman B. Visscher was dead by October 1764. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that his wife had passed on about 1764.</p>
