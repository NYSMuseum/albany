<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Vrooman</b></a> was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in October 1705. She was the daughter of refugees Hendrick and his second wife, Maria Wemp Vrooman. Shortly after her birth, Hendrick took his family home to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where Maria lived for the next twenty years.</p>


<p>In February 1728, she married Albany native <a href="../s/isswitts5661.html">Isaac Switts</a>. By 1746, six children were christened at the Albany church where she was a member,  pewholder, and occasional baptism sponsor. However, her family did not flourish as she lived to see at least five of her children <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the church cemetery.</p>

<p>Maria's husband was a skipper, businessman, and assistant alderman. Their family lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html">third ward</a>. These Swittses owned additional property in Schenectady. Isaac Switts died in 1787. <a href="../../res/ts.html">T</a>raditional sources state that Maria died after 1773.
