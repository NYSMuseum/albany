      <P>At this point, we are struggling to discern and deliniate the individuals 
        who lived in early Albany and were known by the names of Veeder - Veder 
        - Vedder. We are comfortably "in denial" regarding all other <a href="../../res/sp.html">variations</a>. 
      <p>Were they a single <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> family? 
        Two distinct families? Three or more? Our plan here is to work with individuals 
        known in <a href="../../criteria.html">Albany</a> as "Veeder" and to see 
        if they are connected to those who lived in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a> and were also known as "Veder" and "Vedder". At this point, 
        we do not know and move forward cautiously following individual life stories 
        as is our general custom. 
      <p>Our travails are complicated by the inconsistent spelling(s) of the name(s) 
        in the community record and by historians and <a href="http://www.fortklock.com/vaderexpandpt2.htm">genealogists</a> 
        ever since. Over the past thirty years, I have spoken with a number of 
        people who claim to have "their V's straight. No one, repeat no one yet 
        encountered has been able to divide all of them perfectly! 
      <p>The first Veeder in what became the city of Albany appears to have been 
        <a href="sivveeder.html">Simon Volkertse</a> who came to the Hudson Valley 
        during the 1650s. Eight of his children married and raised families. 
      <p>One of them does not appear to have been <a href="havedder6747.html">Harme 
        Vedder</a> who was identified as the owner of an Albany house in <a href="../../census1679.html#140">1679</a>. 
      <p>The name of "Mr. Simeon Veder" (known mostly as <a href="siveeder6776.html">Simon 
        J. Veeder</a> appeared on the census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html#108">1756</a>. 
        The same individual was called "Seymon Johs Veeder" in a petition sent 
        to the governor by Albany merchants in <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#6776">1764</a>. 
      <p>All three spellings were used by the Albany assessor's in composing the 
        tax rolls in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>. Three distinct 
        "Veeders" were listed as heads of families on the first Federal <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> 
        taken just two years later.</p>
      <p>So for now, Veeder appears to be a city-based usage for an essentially 
        single but substantial household through time (one main household in the 
        city). The other spellings/names appear to be found more in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">rings</a> 
        of settlement around Albany. 
      <p>Those mostly known as <b>Vedder</b> appear to be descended from <a href="havedder6747.html">Harmen 
        Albertse</a> who is said to have emigrated to Beverwyck by 1647 but "retired" 
        to Schenectady and lived into the eighteenth century. His large family 
        spread out in the region especially in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 
        Son <a href="covedder.html">Corset</a> was married to two Albany natives.</p>
