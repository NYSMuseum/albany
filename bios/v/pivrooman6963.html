<strong>Pieter Mees Vrooman</strong></a> was one of three brothers who <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/vrooman_hm.html">settled</a> in the upriver region of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>.

<p>He was living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> at the time of the initial allocation of houselots and received patents in 1659 and 1660. In 1657, he purchased a "tile kiln" north of the community and held it for two years.

<p>In 1679, his name was included on a <a href="../../census1679.html#6963">census</a> of Albany householders. His house was on Jonker (State) Street near the church.  In April 1683, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willabstaats.html">will</a> filed by a neighbor.

<p>He may have married Geertruy Weckmans in 1655. Perhaps, they had three sons. His second wife was Volckie Pieters. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and his maid received support from the deacons.

<p>Pieter Mees Vrooman was <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">dead</a> by March 1684 and his taxes were in arrears. His widow re-married on June 28, 1685.</p>
