<P>Her name <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled and referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Willempie Viele</strong></a> was the daughter of New Netherland native <a href="acviele6777.html">Aernout Cornelise</a> and <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Gerritje Gerrits - who may have been born in Europe. Willempie probably was born within a few years of 1660 when her father was <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6777">identified</a> as fur trader of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. She may have been the sister of eight siblings. 

<p>Willempie Viele is said to have <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> three times. In 1683, she wed <a href="../s/syschermerhorn.html">Symon Schermerhorn</a>. By the time of his death about 1695, the union produced four children who were christened in Albany and in New York.  In June 1699, she married widower <a href="../w/liwinne2995.html">Livinius Winne</a>. By 1705, three children had been christened in Albany. And in June 1709, she <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WqdBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=%22Willempje+Viele,+wid.+of+Levinus+Winnen%22&source=bl&ots=l-etWQYTvs&sig=zUjXWc-1oL94NeZFDPSCSgqWcQ8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimiNHatdnKAhVMVT4KHZkXBMUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Willempje%20Viele%2C%20wid.%20of%20Levinus%20Winnen%22&f=false">married</a> widower <a href="../vh/jovh6408.html">Johannes Van Hoesen</a> at the Albany church. At that time, she was identified as the widow of Winne and was living in Albany. Over at least two decades, Willempie was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In August 1710, a girl named for her mother was christened at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>. In February 1712, a final child was christened in Claverack.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6788">1709</a>, the Albany assessment roll valued the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</A> property of "Willemtie Winne" substantially.  

<p>After that, she is said to have joined her new husband  a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">freeholder</a> of Claverack, may have bore additional <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=idgUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=willempie+viele+claverack&source=bl&ots=c6-zcYu7Gy&sig=9DFHEtYyICegUXGZKndBoi7hssY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjul6PottnKAhXIXD4KHd7hD8QQ6AEIMTAF#v=onepage&q=willempie%20viele%20claverack&f=false">children</a> (although she would have been about 50 at the time of her third marriage) , and is said to have died after 1714.</p>
