<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Nanning Visscher</strong></a> was born in December 1732. He was the first son born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="jovisscher4142.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/anstaats4552.html">Anna Staats</a>  Visscher. He grew up in a large family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1744, he was identified as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjovisscher4142.html">will</a> of his father. His father died in 1749 and his mother soon re-married. 

<p>Nanning came of age and took over in his father's business. In <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4161">1764</a>, he joined other Albany merchants in petitioning the royal government regarding the fur trade. In November 1760, he was almost twenty-eight when he married Catharina Wendell. But she died in 1763 after giving birth to only one child. Nanning re-married in November 1764. His second wife was Lena Lansing. By 1777, their  marriage had produced four children who were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and pewholder. 

<p>We seek information on the remainder of his life!
