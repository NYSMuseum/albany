<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Viele</strong></a> was born in February 1739. She was the daughter of Hugo Viele and his first wife, Catharina Van Woert Viele. Anna was a younger child in the large family of a <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>-based widower who re-married in 1752. 

<p>In December 1758, she married Albany native <a href="../w/frwinne3838.html">Frans Winne, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1779, nine children had been christened in the church where she was an occasional baptism sponsor. 

<p>These Winnes raised their family in wartime Albany where woodworker Frans lent his talent and support to the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties. 

<p>Their <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> holdings were valued on the Albany assessment in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3838">1779</a>. However, perhaps this family left Albany as afterwards, his name appears to have dropped from community-based rolls.

<p>Perhaps, she died in Saratoga County in <a href="http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/7522043/person/-1078961073">1798</a>. With outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the later life and passing of Anna Viele Winne, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
