<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit T. Visscher</b></a> probably was born in February 1738. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="tevisscher4174.html">Teunis</a> and <a href="../l/maclansing3487.html">Machtelt Lansing</a> Visscher. In 1754, a lifelong association with the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> began when he became a pewholder in the gallery of the Albany church.</p>

<p>In October 1762, he married Albany native <a href="../f/alfonda3779.html">Alida Fonda</a>. That marriage was short-lived and produced only two children before her death. In February 1771, Gerrit re-married - taking <a href="../vd/ravdb5844.html">Rachel Vandenbergh</a> as his second wife. The second marriage added at least one more child born six months after the wedding.</p>

<p>His home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> was situated between the houses of his father and brother. A carpenter and builder, he also owned lots in other parts of the city. Although an occasional contractor of the city, this Market Street <a href="../../census1790.html#4119">mainstay</a> may have held no service positions until being appointed a fireman in 1791 when he was in his fifties.</p>

<p>In 1773, he testified before the city council during a voting controversey. In 1775, he was among a group of Albany residents who complained to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> that certain merchants were selling products for more than the fixed price limit. He contributed to the relief of Ticonderoga. In 1779, he was exempted from active duty stating that he <a href="../../or/or-as.html">worked</a> for storekeeper <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a>. Later, he received a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany County militia.</p> 

<p>Over the next two decades, his name appeared on community rolls as it did before the war. As late as 1797, he still was identified as a carpenter. In <a href="../../census1800.html#4119">1800</a>, his household included four children, a slightly younger woman (his second <a href="../vd/ravdb5844.html">wife</a> had died in 1799), and one slave. </p>
 
<p>Gerrit T. Visscher died in early January 1805 and was buried from the Dutch church. His will passed probate on January 20. He had lived almost sixty-seven years.
