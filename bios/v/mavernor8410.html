<P><a href="#sources"><b>Martha Vernor</b></a> was the wife of Albany innkeeper <a href="jovernor.html">John Vernor</a>. After his death, "Widow Vernor's Tavern" was an Albany landmark!</p>

<p>During the 1740s and 50s, she gave birth to several Vernor children who established the name in Albany and in the greater upriver region.</p>

<p>By 1766, her husband was dead and she was running the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> tavern with the help of her sons. In 1773, a New York paper advertized Mohawk land sold at her house in Albany. In 1775 and '76, the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> held sessions at her "house."</p>

<p>Over the next decades, her name disappeared from Albany rolls. She probably was part of the large household of her son-in-law, <a href="../h/rhenry8425.html">Robert Henry</a>.

<p>Martha Vernor was dead by March 6, 1793 when an inventory was made of her estate. Her property included five beds and other household items as well as unsettled debts amounting to &pound1,262.</p>
