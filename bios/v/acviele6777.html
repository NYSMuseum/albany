      <P>According to <a hef="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional resources, <a href="#sources"><b>Aernout 
        Cornelis Viele</b></a> was born in New Amsterdam in May 1640. He was the 
        son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers Cornelis and 
        [reputedly] Maria Du Trieux Viele. His <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/viele_c.html">father</a> 
        was, among other things, a landholder at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</p>
      <p>By the late 1650s, Aernout Cornelise had relocated to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
        to pursue fur trading opportunities. In 1660, he signed a <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6777">petition</a> 
        of prominent fur traders asking for more regulation of the trade. He served 
        as an Indian interpreter and was known as a merchant. In <a href="../../census1679.html#121">1679</a>, 
        his Albany home was included on an assessment of householders. In 1681, 
        he was living in the house of <a href="../b/jhbruyn7464.html">Jan Hendrix 
        de Bruyn</a>. Three years later, he was cited by the Albany court for 
        being in tax <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">arrears</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1663, he had married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Gerretje Gerrits 
        of Amsterdam. The marriage may have produced eight children, a number 
        of whom became prominent in Albany and regionally. He later became a member 
        and supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
		
<p>He <a href="../../res/ts.html">enjoyed</a> some renown as an interpreter <a href="../../cia.html">and</a> Indian agent and spent considerable <a href="../m/pamcgreg.html">time</a> among the Iroquois. During the 1680s and 90s, his name appeared on lists of Albany merchants. His daughter and her children were <a  href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~vanepsgenealogy/schmass.html">killed</a> and his son taken prisoner during the attack on <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> in 1690.  He was appointed Indian agent by <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a>.</p>
