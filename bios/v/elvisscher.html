<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Visscher</strong></a> was born in October 1743. She was the daughter of Johannes and Catharine Van Slyck Visscher. She appears to have been the youngest child in a smallish and mostly <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>-based family.

<p>In December 1762, she married Albany native <a href="../g/heglen4923.html">Henry Glen</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Schenectady. By 1785, seven children were christened at the Dutch churches in Albany and Schenectady where both parents were prominent members.

<p>Henry Glen was a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> trader who seems to have maintained residences in both <a href="../../census1790.html#4923">Albany</a> and    <a href="#1800">Sch</A>enectady.



<p>Elizabeth Visscher Glen died in May 1809. She had lived almost sixty-six years. Her husband survived until January 1814 when he was buried from his Schenectady home.</p>
