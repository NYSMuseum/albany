<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Vosburgh</strong></a> was born about 1652. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="abpvosburgh.html">Abraham Pieters</a> and <a href="../c/geercoey.html">Geertruy Coeymans</a> Vosburgh. His father died tragically in 1659.

<p>As a young man, he may have lived for a time with his widowed mother. In <a href="../../census1679.html#11">1679</a>, his mother's Albany household was taxed for stockade maintenance.

<p>During the 1680s, he married Jannetje Barents <a href="../vi/vi.html">Mynderts</a>. The marriage produced several children. He was a member and supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>He seems to have been among the earliest inhabitants of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. In 1681, and for several decades thereafter, he served as a justice of the peace there. His name is a prominent feature of many Albany County documents from those times.

<p>In 1689, he was authorized to administer his deceased father-in-law's estate. 

<p>Calling himself a resident of Kinderhook, Pieter Vosburgh is said to have filed a <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/state/bios/fg/vosburgh001.txt">will</a> 
        in June 1690. However, no children were named. His younger brother, <a href="isvosburgh.html">Isaac</a>, is said to have lived with him and to have inherited some of his property. 
      
<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#pivo">1697</a>, his household was configured on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> census. During those years, he was a prominent resident of eastern Albany County who was a contractor of the Albany corporation as well. 

<p>In February 1715, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">will</a> of Dirck Wesselse Ten Broeck. In <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyalbany/census/1720.html">1720</a>, the name "Pieter Fausburgh" appeared on a Kinderhook freeholder list. After that, subsequent references would be to younger individuals of that name.</p>
