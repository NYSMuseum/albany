<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Bastian H. Visscher</strong></a> was born in January 1732. He was the first child born to the marriage Harmanus and Sara Wyngaert Visscher. He grew up in a large family. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=20 height=10 alt="family information under  development"></a>


<p>Perhaps this individual was a bachelor as no marriage or family information has been found in the records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, he did occasionally witness baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - sometimes with his mother.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#24">1756</a>, he may have been one of the "Fishers" who were identified as householders by the British army.

<p>The existence of same/similarly-named contemporaries including the more prominent Watervliet resident <a href="btvisscher4063.html">Bastian T. Visscher</a> restrains us from assigning qualitative information here for anyone but "Bastian H. Visscher." However, we do expect to link this subject to some <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. 

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4103">1779</a>, his third ward house and property were assessed substantially (particularly his personal property). He also owned a <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#bhv">lot</a> in the first ward. a decade <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4103">later</a>, his house and property were valued in the same location.

<p>In April 1769, he had been named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willbarvisscher.html">will</a> of his brother-in-law. In November 1785, he relinquished the executorship.

<p>Bastian H. Visscher filed a <a href="../../wills/willbavisscher4103.html">will</a> in January 1790. It named only the children of his brother and sister as heirs and included an <a href="../../wills/willbavisscher4103.html#inv">inventory</a> of his estate. His will passed probate in late December 1793.</p>
