<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Abrahamse</strong></a> probably was born during the late 1650s. He <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/state/bios/fg/vosburgh001.txt#591">appears</a> to have been the youngest son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="abpvosburgh.html">Abraham Pieterse</a> and <a href="../c/geercoey.html">Geertruy Coeymans</a> Vosburgh. His father was killed in 1659 leaving a widow and a number of children to further establish the <a href="vosburgh.html">family</a> in Albany and beyond.

<p>Isaac's mother seems to have carried on her late husband's enterprises and was listed among Albany householders in <a href="../../census1679.html#11">1679</a>. Shortly thereafter, she re-located her family to the new settlement at <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> where Isaac and other children also set down roots. 

<p>In March 1681, he was among those living in Kinderhook who were <a href="../../sources.html#cma">questioned</a> by the Albany sheriff in the course of a homicide investigation.

<p>These Vosburghs were members and communicants at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Isaac first announced his intention to marry Anneke Jans (Goes?) in August 1686. By 1708, their eleven children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor. He later was among the founding <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/kind/reformed_protestant_dutch_church.htm">members</a> of the Kinderhook Reformed church.

<p>He is <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/state/bios/fg/vosburgh001.txt">said</a> to have lived with his brother <a href="pivosburgh.html">Pieter</a> and to have been left part of their farm by the terms of Pieter Vosburgh's will of 1690. 
<p>In December 1694, he was identified as a "justice of the peace" and, with Pieter Vosburgh,  was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HItPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=%22peter+and+isaac+vosburgh%22&source=bl&ots=O7kEWvksG2&sig=A2RW4WnunVQxssWfMlxkE45zjOI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yR2pT9ikBsmg6QHvrKGfBA&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20and%20isaac%20vosburgh%22&f=false">slated</a> to deliver wood to heat the Albany blockhouses.

<p>The county census in <a href="../../census1697.html#isvo">1697</a> identified him as a resident of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. His household with a wife and four children was listed nearby but separately from that of Pieter Vosburgh. </p>
 
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">1701</a>, he was among the loyal residents of greater Albany County who petitioned the royal governor for protection. 


<p>The pre-eminent family genealogist has <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/state/bios/fg/vosburgh001.txt">offered</a> that <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> native Isaac Vosburgh lived into the 1760s and that he was 105 years old at the time of his death. Eight of his children lived to marry and raise families - mostly in the Kinderhook area. However, his name <a href="../qqqq.html">seems</a> to be absent from likely <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">community surveys</a> for Kinderhook during most of the eighteenth century. </p>
