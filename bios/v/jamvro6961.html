      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Meese</b></a> <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~hft/dutch/vrooman/vrooman.html">may</a> 
        have been born in the Netherlands about 1616. He and two brothers emigrated 
        to New Netherland in the decade before the English takeover. Jacob Meese 
        initially served the Van Rensselaers and then became a carpenter in Albany. 
        Other Vrooman family members settled in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</p>
      <p>He married Elizabeth (De Lint), the widow of Teunis Cornelise Swart. 
        The marriage does not seem to have produced any children. He was a member 
        of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and an occasional 
        baptism sponsor. 
      <p>Vrooman lived in the third ward and was <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#6961">involved</a> 
        in commmunity-based business activities. His Albany house was destroyed 
        by fire in 1681. However, that home does not seem to have been included 
        on the community-wide census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>.</p>
      <p>Calling himself a carpenter of "Albany city," Jacob Meese Vrooman filed 
        a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA447&lpg=PA447&dq=%22vrooman+jacob+meesen%22&source=bl&ots=4RKoYAoW0P&sig=6yt7JpWs57ffLUU6r1H7HOb43g0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RCr0UKSoGcuH0QG8xYDgBQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22vrooman%20jacob%20meesen%22&f=false">will</a> 
        in July 1691. It bequeathed an estate of real and personal property to 
        his wife. Vrooman probably died shortly after and widow Elizabeth re-married.</p>
