<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent Visscher</strong></a> was born in March 1737. He was the son of <a href="jovisscher4142.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/anstaats4552.html">Anna Staats</a> Visscher. He grew up as a younger son in the large family of a trader-turned-businessman and civic leader who died when Barent was just twelve.

<p>In 1744, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjovisscher4142.html">will</a> filed by his father. His widowed mother later married newcomer <a href="../r/joroorbach.html">John Roorbach</a> and lived in Albany until the late 1780s.

<p>In April 1765, Barent married Albany native <a href="savisscher4170.html">Sara Visscher</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1776, six children had been christened at the church where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>Perhaps he was the "B. Visscher" who <a href="../../solconst.html#4063">signed</a> the Sons of Liberty Constitution during the winter of 1766.

<p>During the mid-1760s, his house and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> were valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>.

<p>Barent Visscher a <a href="../../wills/willbarvisscher.html">characterized</a> himself as an "Indian <a href="../../furtrade.html">Tr</a>ader" - following a path taken by his father and other Visscher family members. At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he was among the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>  residents who contributed to the American cause. However, he would not live through the impending <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">conflict</a>.
 
<p>Barent Visscher had filed a <a href="../../wills/willbarvisscher.html">will</a> in 1769. It named his wife as primary heir and his children to inherit his estate after her passing or re-marriage. Barent probably died sometime in or after 1776. His widow first was identified as the property owner of record in 
<a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4170">1779</a>.  

<p>Barent Visscher was dead by November 1785 when his will passed probate. Living with her son, widow Sara Visscher maintained their home on lower <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a> until her death in 1822.</p>
