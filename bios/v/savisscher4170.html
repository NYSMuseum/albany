<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Sara Visscher</strong></a> was born in September 1741. She was the daughter of <a href="havisscher4128.html">Harman</a> and <a href="../w/sawyn6231.html">Sara Wyngaert</a> Visscher. She was a middle child in a large and prominent third ward family.

<p>In April 1765, Sara married <a href="barvisscher.html">Barent Visscher</a> at that Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1776, six children had been christened at the church where she was a member and pewholder. Her marriage, however, was not a long one as Barent Visscher died sometime after the birth of their last child in 1776.

<p>In his <a href="../../wills/willbarvisscher.html">will</a> filed in 1769, Barent Visscher left his entire estate to his "beloved wife" to sustain their family during her widowhood.

<p>With the passing of her husband, Widow Sara Visscher took over management of the family assets. Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4170">1779</a>, her house and property were <a href="#1779">valued</a> on the city assessment rolls.

<p>In November 1785, letters of administration were officially <a href="../../guide/histres.html#later">granted</a> to her on Barent Visscher's estate as the previous administrators had been relieved.

<p>During the 1780s, she was able to obtain and exchange lots and parcels in the second ward in <a href="../../res/realestate.html">transactions</a> involving the city government.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4170">1788</a>, her house and property were valued moderately. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4170">1790</a>, her second ward household probably included her son, his wife, and their child. However, in <a href="../../census1800.html#jf">1800</a>, the census probably counted her under the second ward household of her son John.

<p>With <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22visscher+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22visscher%20john%22&f=false">one</a> exception, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> included her "Widow Visscher" at 61 Columbia Street for the remainder of her life.</p>
 
<p>Widow Sara Visscher is said to have died in August 1822. A functional widow for more than four decades, this Albany native had lived more than eighty-one years.</p>
