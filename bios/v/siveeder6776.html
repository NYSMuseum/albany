<strong>Simon J. Veeder</strong></a> was born in October 1709. He was the son of Johannes S. and  his first wife Susanna Wemple Veeder. His mother died in 1712 and his father re-married.


<p>In December 1730, he married Albsany native <a href="../k/geerkip5952.html">Geertruy Kip</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced four children before Geertruy died in July 1746. In December 1749, Simon then married the widow Anna Van Antwerpen Bradt in Schenectady. They had three children by 1758 - all christened in Albany where Simon was a lifelong member, pewholder, and deacon.

<p>Simon J. Veeder was a notable Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#108">merchant</a> with <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property (including lots) that was ranked at the top on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. He was a conspicuous <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#6776">presence</a> in representing Albany's trading interests before provincial authorities. His many clients and customers included Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>.

<p>He <a href="../../corporation.html">served</a> the community as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and then was elected assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> - first in 1740.

<p>He also was interested in frontier land and was able to acquire at least sixteen lots in the <a href="../../na/kayad.html">Kayaderosseras Patent</a> during the late 1760s and 70s.

<p>During the war for Independence, he supported the American <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">cause</a> by pledging supplies for the  Continental army. Near his seventies, he probably was too old for a more active part.

<p>Simon J. Veeder died in September 1786 and was buried from his church.</p>
