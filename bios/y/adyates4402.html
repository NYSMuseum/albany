      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Adam Yates</b></a> was born in August 1708. He 
        was the son of Albany blacksmith <a href="chyates4407.html">Christoffel</a> 
        and <a href="../w/cawinne2824.html">Catalina Winne</a> Yates. He was the 
        much older brother of Albany leader and future neighbor <a href="ayjr.html">Abraham 
        Yates, Jr.</a> </p>
      <p>In June 1733, he married <a href="../g/angerr6014.html">Anna Gerrits</a>, 
        the daughter of an Albany shoemaker. By 1749, the marriage had produced 
        six children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor.</p>
      <p>His home was in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of 
        Albany, downstream from that of his father near the outlet of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a>. He also secured several lots north of his home - reaching beyond 
        the stockade and into the "<a href="../../loc/wout.html">W</a>outenbergh" 
        (woods). In 1739, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
        for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#287">1756</a>, 
        this Albany householder was identified as a "<a href="../../trades/leather.html">S</a>howmaker." His name also 
        appeared on Albany "freeholders" <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3">lists</a>. 
        In 1748, his lot in the third ward was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> 
        of an Albany neighbor.</p>
      <p>Although <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4402">recognized</a> as 
        an Albany mainliner, during the 1760s, he was in trouble with the city 
        government for refusing to remove a house and fence from his land that 
        was needed for a street. This disagreement lasted for most of the decade 
        and may have been resolved in 1771 when he was granted lots along Foxes 
        Creek to use as <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning pits</a>.</p>
      <p>Married for eighteen years, Adam Yates lost his wife in 1751. He lived 
        on in his third ward home, raised his family, and contributed to the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Revolutionary 
        cause</a> during the early days of the conflict. He was last heard from 
        in 1775 when he was in his late sixties!</p>
