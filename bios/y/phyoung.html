<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Young</strong></a> was born during the 1730s.

<p>In December 1760, he was identified as a feltmaker of the city of Albany when he married Albany native <a href="../s/ansickles1498.html">Anna Sickles</a>. By 1771, five children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents received services and were occasional baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>In 1766, his modest holdings were assessed in the west manor of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. The next year, he owned a house in Albany's first ward and was living there. By <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6970">1779</a>, however he had relocated to the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where his real property was valued. However, in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6970">1788</a>, his house and property were listed in the first ward).  His household was configured on the third ward census of <a href="../../census1790.html#6970">1790</a> and included only a man and a woman. His name was not on the city census in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>. 

<p>In January <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=night+watch+%22philip+young%22+albany&source=bl&ots=wxeEgQvagz&sig=ZySttBbUuHTnsnCHdeMig-C1JMU&hl=en&ei=PFBBTselGenh0QHe_eC7CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=night%20watch%20%22philip%20young%22%20albany&f=false">1770</a>, he was made a member of the Albany night watch.</p>

<p>Young's name appeared on the muster roll of a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company in 1767. Later, he was awarded a Revolutionary War <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Eighth Regiment of he Albany County militia. In 1779, he was identified as a rank-and-file member of Captain <a href="../p/joprice6447.html">John Price's</a> militia company.</p>  

<p>Philip Young lost his wife in 1793. He died in June 1800 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
