          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Christopher J. Yates</B></A> was born in 
            August 1738. He was the eldest son of Albany blacksmith and landholder 
            <a href="joyates4479.html">John Yates</a> and his wife, Albany-born 
            <a href="../w/rewaldron672.html">Rebecca Waldron</a>.</P>

          <P>He married Rensselaerswyck native <a href="../l/calansing3193.html">Catharina 
            Lansing</a> in 1761. Their nine children were baptized in the Albany 
            <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1763 and 1779.</P>

          <p>Like his father and several members of the <a href="yates.html">Yates</a> 
            family, Christopher was a blacksmith. He probably learned the trade 
            in his father's Albany shop and inherited John Yates's tools as his 
            birthright on the death of his father in 1776. He also was left the 
            <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farm where 
            he was living and would receive another east manor farm on the death 
            of his mother. In 1781, he petitioned for city land at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Tiondoroge</a>.</p>

<p>Christopher J. Yates was one of a number of early Albany people who lived outside the core city but whose business (in this case a smithy and stables) made them part of the everyday community economy. His real estate holdings placed him above most Albany artisans. In 1790, his Rensselaerswyck household was served by three slaves.</p>

          <p>During the 1760s, he served in the Rensselaerswyck company of the provincial 
            militia and was awarded a bounty right under the Fourth Regiment of 
            the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany County Militia</a> during 
            the <a href="../../or/or.html">War for Independence</a>.</p>

<p>His household was not included on the Albany or Watervliet <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1790c">censuses</a> for 1790 or 1800. His youngest son was city physician <a href="chyates4463.html">Christopher C. Yates.</a></p>
