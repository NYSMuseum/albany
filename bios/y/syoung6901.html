<p> <a href="#biography"><b>Simeon/Simon Young</b></a> was appointed <a href="../..//sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County on June 19, 1696 and served until October 1698. He was the third sheriff appointed under the Albany <a href="../../charter.html">city charter</a> of 1686.</p>

<p>Previously, he had been a lieutenant in one of the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison 
            companies</a> and was quartered in the Albany house of merchant, <a href="../l/anlispenard8081.html">Anthony 
            Lispenard</a>. Although considered one of the more able young officers, 
            this European-born veteran of the "Irish War" was sued for child support 
            by <a href="../vd/arvdh5674.html">Ariantie Vanderheyden</a> in 1695. 
            The following year, he acknowledged paternity and sought custody of 
            the child. With another women, he fathered a daughter in 1696.</p>

<p>Although he "took" the <a href="../../census1697.html">census</a> in 1697, his name was omitted from that list of Albany householders. His name does not appear on other community-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">survey</a> documents.

<p>Waiting for discharge, instead he was recommissioned as a lieutenant in the company of Captain James Weems. He seems to have left the area before 1700.</P>
