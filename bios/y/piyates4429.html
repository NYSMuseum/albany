      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Yates</strong></a> was born in January 
        1727. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="chyates4407.html">Christoffel</a> 
        and <a href="../w/cawinne2824.html">Catalina Winne</a> Yates. He was 
        a younger son in a large family raised in a blacksmith's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>. He was named for his maternal grandfather - the <a href="../w/piwinne8568.html">patriarch</a> 
        of the Winne family. 
      <P>Like his more famous, slightly older <a href="ayjr.html">brother</a>, this Pieter Yates rose from modest beginnings to prominence - although, like many other Albany <a href="../../marriages.html#sons">boys</a>, he found success beyond the city limits.

<p>About 1749, he married <a href="../va/savalst.html">Sara Van Alsytne</a>. By 1767, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Like his father, he was a <a href="../../census1756.html#57">smith</a> who raised his family in a good <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">house</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4429">1763</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders. In <a href="../..//lists/list1764.html">1764</a>, he signed a petition from Albany businessmen regarding the fur trade. In 1766, he signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#4429">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty.

<p>During the 1750s and 60s, he performed services for the city government and sought and received additional lots near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.

<p>As early as the 1770s, he seems to have left Albany. He relocated to <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> where he <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/tax2.htm">lived</a> on a farm for the rest of his life. From the early days of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he was an officer in the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">army</a> and commanded a regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. He was known as "Colonel Peter Yates."

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1800</a>, his household was enumerated on the Schaghticoke <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/census7.htm?cj=1&o_xid=0001027214&o_lid=0001027214">census</a> with one younger man and seven slaves.
<p>Pieter Yates filed a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/will129.htm">will</a> in Rensselaer County on August 15, 1807. It left a very substantial estate (mostly farm lands) to his children. His wife, Sara, was not mentioned in the will.  However, provision was made for his "present wife" whom he married in October 1796. "Col." Pieter Yates died in September 1807. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, his vacant lot on Columbia Street was valued on the third ward assessment roll as the property of the "heirs of Peter Yates of Schaghticoke - a non resident).
