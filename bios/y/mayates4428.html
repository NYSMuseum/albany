<strong>Maria Yates</strong></a> was was born  in October 1768. She was the daughter of Albany leader <a href="ryates.html">Robert Yates</a> and his wife, <a href="../vn/javness965.html">Jannetje Van Ness</a> Yates. She grew up in the <a href="ryates.html#home">homes</a> of a rising attorney and local surveyor located up the <a href="../../streets.html#state">hill</a> in Albany.

<P>"Mary" was not yet eighteen in August 1786 when she married newcomer <a href="../f/jafairlie8015.html">James Fairlie</a> at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. A number of children were christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church where Maria was confirmed in September 1791.

<p>These Fairlies made their home on <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> where James made his way as a governmental placeman - no doubt aided by the fact that he was a Revolutionary War officer and the son-in-law of jurist Robert Yates. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8015">1790</a>, their substantial <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8015">home</a> included five family members.

<p>However, even before Robert Yates's death in 1801, Fairlie had re-located his family to New York where he served as a judicial clerk and alderman. James Fairlie died in New York in 1830.

<p>Her daughter, Mary, occasioned <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=HbwhEExtGUAC&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22maria+yates%22+%22james+fairlie%22&source=web&ots=Zp5g3pBM0P&sig=R4Ug3RDSinvSsI2jwCjTpikHmBE">notice</a> in New York social circles.

<p>Perhaps, her <a href="http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!206238!0#focus">portrait</a> was painted in 1807. In 1824, the Fairlies sold a <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~garylam/project/creation.html">parcel of land</a> in New York City. Maria Yates Fairlie died sometime thereafter. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek information</a> on her later life and passing.</p>
