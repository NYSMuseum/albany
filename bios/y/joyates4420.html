            <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Joseph Yates, Jr.</strong></a> was 
              born in March 1695. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="joyates4419.html">Joseph</a> 
              and <a href="../m/humarselis726.html">Huybertie Marselis</a> Yates. 
              He grew up in a blacksmith's home on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">South 
              side</a> of Albany.</p>
            <p>In May 1719, he married a slightly older <a href="../h/henhooghkerk3594.html">Hendrickie 
              Hooghkerk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
              By 1736, eight children had been christened at the Albany church 
              where he was a member, pewholder, and occasional baptism sponsor. 
            <p>He followed his father and <a href="chyates4407.html">older brother</a> 
              in the smith's trade and was a first ward <a href="../../census1756.html#94">mainstay</a> 
              for many years. He served his community as constable and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, 
              served in the <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#4420">city company</a> 
              of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>, and was among 
              those listed as <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4420">freeholders</a> 
              on several during <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4420">the</a> 
              eighteenth century. He was a contractor of the city and owned Albany 
              property in addition to his house and shop. As late as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, 
              his holdings were accorded a moderate assessment. His life appears 
              to have been confined to Albany and should not be confused with 
              the more wide-ranging ambitions of his cousin, Joseph Yates of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 
            <p>Joseph Yates, Jr. lost his wife in January 1750. In <a href="../../wills/willecollins.html">1752</a>, 
              he witnessed the will of an Albany neighbor. 
            <p>He was last noted in the community record in 1775 when "Joseph 
              Yates" was among the Albany residents who contributed supplies for 
              the relief of Ticonderoga. He would have been eighty-years-old at 
              that time!</p>
