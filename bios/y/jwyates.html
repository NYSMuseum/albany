      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Waters Yates</strong></a> was born in September 
        1769. He was the son of <a href="chyates4460.html">Christopher A.</a> 
        and <a href="../w/cawaters6820.html">Catharina Waters</a> Yates. He 
        grew up in a merchant's <a href="../../census1790.html#4460">home</a> 
        that was located just <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">north</a> of 
        the city. 
      <p>He was sent to Columbia University and graduated in 1787. Although trained in the law (admitted to practice in Saratoga County in 1791), he became a clerk in the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a> and continued there until 1803 when he was named cashier of the New York State Bank.

<p>In 1790, he was appointed an ensign in the militia. Five years later, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=icI1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA313&lpg=PA313&dq=%22john+w.+yates%22+albany&source=bl&ots=jRB8-3hNOZ&sig=ZEiDwHErlNO8bCREbP_NXV0L-P4&hl=en&ei=1OKiScJKhNw0lP6s3gs&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result">promoted </a> to lieutenant in John H. <a href="../w/johwendell2975.html">W</a>endell's regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. He held that commission for two years and then resigned.

<p>In November 1808, he married <a href="../m/anmet.html">Ann Metcalf</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced a number of children. These Yateses were associated with <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the census return for his Albany household showed five boys under ten as well as four adult women living with him in his State Street <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22yates,+john+w.%22&source=bl&ots=2hKvLU2z3t&sig=CoJn5xETxOf6sRCkbQCsW9dMDh4&hl=en&ei=1NqiSYWqG4LqNLS-7NYL&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result">home</a>.  

<p>In 1813, he was a <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/celebrationofsem00alba/celebrationofsem00alba_djvu.txt">trustee</a> of the newly formed Albany Academy and served as its first treasurer. Upon John W.'s death, his son succeeded him as treasurer.

<p>In 1820, he was named first treasurer of the newly incorporated <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Albany Savings Bank</a> with Stephen Van Rensselaer as its president.

<p>In May 1825, I was not surprised to find the name of John W. Yates among the Albany worthies summoned to judge <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LHdKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=yates+metcalf+albany&source=bl&ots=OdpSohotgC&sig=E1t5TzjqOoK04E3iJpTkDm81D7U&hl=en&ei=b_qiSc7pLYjHnQewzKH9DQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result#PPA65,M1">poetical submissions</a> in a competition held at the new Albany Theater. 

<p>In April 1828, a newpaper noted that John W. Yates "first cashier of New York State Bank, graduate of Columbia in 1787, student for bar, 24 years cashier, aged 58, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA470">died</a>, March 29, 1828." His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in 1828.


<p>To a number of important contemporaries, John W. Yates was an unforgettable character. An especially descriptive profile appears in Gorham A. <a href="../w/goworth.html">W</a>orth's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V5UPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=random+recollections+albany&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=0_1#PPA66,M1"><i>Random Recollections of Albany</i></a>. In 1830, his widow was living at 304 North Market Street. Ann Metcalf Yates survived until 1846.
