<strong>Henry Yates</strong></a> was born in September 1763. He was the son of <a href="abjyates4440.html">Abraham J.</a> and <a href="../b/jabradt4248.html">Jannetie Bradt</a> Yates.  He grew up a member of a  mid-size family in a baker's home on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>.

<p>Although still an adolescent during the war years, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4413">land bounty right</a> for <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.
 
<p>In January 1786, he married <a href="../vz/ravzandt316.html">Rachel Van Zandt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1803, the marriage had produced eight children.

<p>Beginning with the census of <a href="../../census1790.html#4413">1790</a>, this Yates family also lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> nearby the homes of both of their families. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1788">1788</a> and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1791">1791</a>, Henry served as a fireman. In 1794, Henry was noted in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> of his father. <a href="../../census1800.html#4413">Census returns</a> over the next two decades document the growth of his family in their home at <a href="../../streets.html#green"> 22 Green Street</a>.   First ward assessment rolls testify to the modest nature of his holdings.

<p>Henry Yates was dead by 1813, when his  widow's name began appearing the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> as the head of their Green Street household. He had lived for less than fifty years.</p>

The life of Henry <a href="yates.html">Yates</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 4413. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. This Henry Yates was a working class character and should not be confused with a more famous, same-named contemporary from <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/yates/gen-yates.html">Schenectady</a> - a prominent attorney and officeholder.
