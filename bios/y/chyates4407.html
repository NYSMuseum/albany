          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Christoffel Yates</B></A> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Y</a>etts) 
            was born in Albany in April 1684. He was the eldest son of newcomer 
            soldier/blacksmith <a href="joyates4419.html">Joseph Yates</a> and 
            Albany native <a href="../m/humarselis726.html">Huybertie Marselis</a> 
            Yates. He grew up among a number of <a href="../../garrison.html">soldier</a> 
            families on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of 
            Albany.</p>
          <p>In July 1706, he married Albany native <a href="../w/cawinne2824.html">Catalina 
            Winne</a>. The following spring, the first of their ten children was 
            baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> where 
            both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.</p>
          <p>This Yates family set up their modest home in the second <a href="../../wards.html">ward</a> 
            near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. Like his 
            father, Christoffel was a <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith</a>. 
            In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#4407">1715</a>, he was identified 
            as a private in an <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> 
            company. During the 1710s and 20s, he also served as a second ward 
            <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and was high constable 
            for the city in 1715.</p>
          <p>Four of his sons went on to establish families that were prominent 
            in Albany crafts and <a href="../../makers.html">trades</a>. Younger 
            son <a href="ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> became an attorney, 
            revolutionary leader, and later <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
            of Albany.</p>
          <p>Christoffel Yates died in 1754 at age sixty-nine. He was buried in 
            the Dutch church cemetery on February 26.</p>
