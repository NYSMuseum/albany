<P><a href="#sources"><b>Susanna Yates Lansing</b></a> was born in 1762. She was the youngest child of attorney and alderman <a href="ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> and his wife, <a href="../d/andridder5696.html">Anna De Ridder</a>. She grew up in her father's house on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>.</p>


      <p>Susanna or "Santje" had not reached her eighteenth birthday when she married 
        <a href="../l/abglansing3695.html">Abraham G. Lansing</a> at the <a href="../../na/sgtke.html#church">Schaghticoke</a> 
        Dutch church in April 1779. By 1808, their thirteen children had been 
        baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where 
        both parents were members. Her family was larger than most - probably 
        owing to her relatively young age at <a href="../../marriages.html">marriage</a>.</p>

<p>After initially living with both sets of parents, these Lansings set up their home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> in the new house built by her father who died in 1796. Abraham G. Lansing was a prominent Albany merchant, landholder, and official.</p>

<p>She lost her husband in 1834. Susanna Yates Lansing died in February 1840 at age seventy-eight. Her grave is in the Lansing family plot at the Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
