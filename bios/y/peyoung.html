      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Peter Young</b></a> was born about 1749. He probably 
        was of <a href="../ger.html">Ger</a>man origin. However, we seek more 
        definitive information regarding his precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. Arriving in New York, he was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> 
        in January 1770. After reputedly following the <a href="../../trades/metal.html">pewterer</a>'s 
        craft in New York City and living at the Chatham Street home of a barber, 
        he <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">relocated</a> to Albany when Manhattan 
        was occupied by the British.</p>

<p>Within a few years, he had married one Eva <a href="../../res/sp.html">Moore</a> and settled in Albany. By 1792, a number of their children had been christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents received some services. Following the war, Peter Young also was a pewholder in the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.</p>

<p>Although at least one "Peter Young" would serve in the militia and in the New York Line, this newcomer was suspected by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">revolutionaries</a>. In June 1777, he was confined until he voluntarily took the oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>By 1779, he had taken up residence in Albany probably with fellow pewterer <a href="../w/hewill1497.html">Henry Will</a>. Over the next three decades, his house <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">on</a> Market Street near Columbia appeared on city <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6968">assessment rolls</a> and in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22young+peter%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22young%20peter%22&f=false">city directory</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6968">1790</a>, he was identified as the head of a third ward household. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6968">1800</a>, his house was listed in the second ward and included his wife and three young girls.</p>

<p>A possible reason for his relocation came in August 1797, when a <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#market">great fire</a> destroyed the "dwellinghouse stable" on Market Street owned by one "Eldert Tymete" and occupied by "Mr. Peter Young."
 
<p>Perhaps Young continued to work in both New York and Albany. A substantial number and variety of his pewter <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22peter+young%22+pewter&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=9IkAVJ72MtPHgwT7vYC4AQ&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg&biw=1600&bih=732">pieces</a> have survived. A younger <a href="../b/tibrigden7417.html">Timothy Brigden</a> is <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22peter+young%22+brigden+pewter">said</a> to have been his follower.</p>
<p>The first city directory appeared in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22young+peter%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=pewterer&f=false">1813</a> and identified Young as the lone pewterer and living at 36 Columbia Street. At that time, six individuals including Brigden were listed as silversmiths. 
<p>Peter Young died in September 1813 - a month shy of his sixty-fourth birthday. He was buried in the Dutch church plot. His widow lived on in Albany until her passing in 1826.</p>

I applied to several, and tried various kind of Physick until I applied to the French Doctor Blouin who advised me to make use of his Anti-Venereal Pills, so well known by the name of Keyser's Pills. I followed his advice, and by the use of those pills alone, in a short time I recovered my former health. Witness my hand, Peter Young." Quoted verbatim!  </p></font size>
