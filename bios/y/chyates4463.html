<strong>Christopher C. Yates</strong></a> was born in May 1779. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany blacksmith <a href="chjyates4459.html">Christopher J. Yates</a> and his wife <a href="../l/calansing3193.html">Catharina Lansing</a> Yates. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">co</a>untryside outside of Albany. 

<p>This individual was a politically active <a href="../../trades/medical.html">medical doctor</a> who would replace Dr.<a href="../e/joeights7933.html">Jonathan Eights</a> as city physician in 1820.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, his Albany household first appeared on the census and included two boys, three men, a young girl, his wife, and a slave. Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=%22yates,+christopher c.%22&source">1813</a>, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> identified him as a physician and then as "physician and surrogate" at <a href="../../homes.html#ewpearl">71 North Pearl Street</a>. His yellow brick home was an Albany landmark. 

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZoZLAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA99&lpg=PA99&dq=%22christopher+c.+yates%22&source=bl&ots=zbVIeddGqf&sig=-gRJ6iV5OaW1y1YEqtAIqBrNbh0&hl=en&ei=Zgt7StqqH-avtgfG55joAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=%22christopher%20c.%20yates%22&f=false">1806</a>, he was a prominent member and officer in the nearby <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic Lodge</a>. He <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL17711994M/oration-delivered-before-Temple-Lodge,-no.-53">may have presented</a> and published a Masonic oration as early as 1801.  

<p>He <a href="http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/recruit_medicine/RM-ch13.pdf#yates">treated soldiers</a> stationed in the Albany area during the War of 1812. In 1813, he published a medical treatise entitled <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=42Sfuv_VE2MC&pg=PA1&dq=inauthor:%22Christopher+C.+Yates%22#v=onepage&q=&f=false"><i>An essay on the bilious epidemic fever, prevailing in the state of New-York</i></a>. 

<p>In November 1802, he <a href="http://jeffriesb.tripod.com/id4.html">married</a> Ann Muller at the Dutch church in Claverack. Their children were <a href="../../drc.html">christened</a> in Albany in 1805 and 1806. Following her death, Yates married the younger widow <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Emma_Willard#encyclopedia">Emma Hart Willard</a> in 1838. He gave up his practice and moved with her to Boston. The marriage was short-lived as she <a href="http://www.emma.troy.ny.us/about/history/ehwillard/ehwillard.php">left him</a> after nine months. They finally <a href="http://www.emmawillard.org/academics/library/ewscollection/financial.php">divorced</a> in 1843.
 
<p>Dr. Christopher C. Yates died at Parishorough, Nova Scotia in September 1848.
