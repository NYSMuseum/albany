        <p>The <a href="#Yates">Yates</a> family appeared in Albany after 1664 
          with the arrival of English-born <a href="joyates4419.html">Joseph Yates</a> 
          to serve in the garrison at the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>. 
          By the 1680s, he had married New Netherland native <a href="../m/humarselis726.html">Huybertje 
          Marselis</a>. Their nine children established the family in Albany and 
          regionally for generations to come.</p>

        <p>Joseph Yates supplemented a soldier's stipend with local appointments and contracts. 
          He was the first of a number of American Yateses to practice the trade 
          of the blacksmith. Elder sons <a href="chyates4407.html">Chrisoffel</a> 
          and Joseph followed in their father's smithy while the others left for Schenectady and New York.</p>

<p>By the 1760s, Christophel and Joseph Yates were dead but numerous members of the third generation of the family in America had come of age and were emerging from the working class for the first time. Cementing their ties to Albany through marriage, Yates men embraced trades and service activities to support their new families from residences on Albany's <a href="../../streets.html#green">back streets</a>. Hudson Street baker 
<a href="abjyates4440.html">Abraham J. Yates</a> was among them.</p>

<p>After mid-century, <a href="ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a>, <a href="ryates.html">Robert Yates</a>, and <a href="pwyates.html">Peter W. Yates</a> had become attorneys and took their places among the leaders of the Albany community, and, through the opportunities created by the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>, at the state and even national levels as well.

<p>The next generation produced a number of distinguished if not famous personages. <a href="jvnyates.html">John Van Ness Yates</a> and <a href="jwyates.html">John W. Yates</a> were admired and profiled imtimately in <a href="../../sources.html#rr"><i>Random Recollections</i></a>, the classic memoir of Gorham Worth. Grandson of Abraham Yates, Jr., attorney and congressman <a href="../l/geylansing.html">Gerrit Yates Lansing</a> was responsible for creating documents 
<a href="../l/geylansing.html#sources">collections</a> central to the early Albany story.



<p> Beginning with the children of the first Joseph and Huybertie Marselis Yates, as many as 150 members of the family called the city of Albany their home.</p>

      <p><a name="Yates"></a>Saying or writing the English name <b>Yates</b> was a challenge 
        for many early Albany people. Among the most often encountered variants 
        are: aets, jets, zets, and so on. This family is probably not related 
        to the <a href="../e/abeights7800.html">Abraham Eights</a> family, although 
        we often are confused by the Abraham Eightses and Yateses. We call all 
        the descendants of Joseph and Huybertie Marselis "Yates."</p>

        <p><a name=sources></a><b>Sources:</b> In the course of my <a href="../../pgms/woayjr.html">work</a> 
          on Abraham Yates, Jr., I solicited a wide range of living people I thought 
          might know something about the subject. A wonderful core group of genealogists 
          and family historians shared and pointed me to a healthy pile of family-based 
          materials. Particularly gratifying was the kindness and guidance offered 
          by Persis Boyeson and Bobbi Mc Lane. This also is a good place to begin 
          to acknowledge the contributions of historian <b>Stephan Wolf</b> - author 
          of a German language political biography of Abraham Yates, Jr. His long stay at the Project took me back thirty years to when I was researching the subject and was the same age as our young German scholar. Of course, that friendly fellow found much more material than was available in the "Dark Ages" of the 1970s! The <a href="http://www.google.com/#q=yates+history+albany&hl=en&rlz=1R2ADRA_enUS360&prmd=ivb&ei=fwyzTJeUOYa8lQeI6b2MCA&start=10&sa=N&fp=6248f386b3c06fd8">Internet</a> 
          now hosts substantial material on this Yates family - not the least of it comes from our <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+yates+albany">enquiry</a> into the family of a one-time english soldier.
