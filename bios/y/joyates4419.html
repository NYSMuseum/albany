          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Joseph Yates</B></A> was the first member of the <a href="yates.html">Yates 
            family</a> in Albany. Tradition holds that he came to America to serve 
            with the English invasion force after 1664. He was of English background 
            and probably was born in Yorkshire.</p>

          <p>By the early 1680s, he had married New Netherland native <a href="../m/humarselis726.html">Huybertje 
            Marselis</a>. By 1704, she had given birth to seven children Yates 
            children - who then established the family in Albany, Schenectady, 
            and New York.</P>

<p>While serving as a soldier in the <a href="../../garrison.html">Albany garrison</a>, Joseph Yates practiced the blacksmith's <a href="../../makers.html">trade</a> - the occupation of a number of his descendants. He supplemented those incomes by supplying firewood to the fort and also held a municipal appointment as city carter. In 1714, he was <a href="#service">certified</a> as an invalided soldier and as one of those who had served in the <a href="../../garrison.html">Independent Company</a> for upwards of twenty years.</p>

          <p>He first purchased a lot on the south side of lower State Street but later 
            lived on the east corner of <a href="../../streets.html#green">Green</a> 
            and Beaver Streets. His modest home and smithy would be family <a href="../../census1697.html#042">landmarks</a> 
            for many years. In 1684, he was <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">cited</a> for being in tax arrears. He also held a garden lot on the plain near the Marselis 
            homestead. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, the name 
            of Joseph Yates, Sr. appeared on a list of eligible voters in the 
            first ward. </p>

          <p>Joseph and Huybertie Yates lived out their days in the southside home. With 
            <a href="chyates4407.html">children</a> and grandchildren taking 
            their places in Albany society, Joseph Yates died in May 1730 and 
            Huybertie two months later. They were buried in the Dutch church cemetery 
            a stone's throw from their home.</p>
