      <p>Although <b>Robert Yates</b> was baptized in the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady 
        Dutch church in 1738, his <a href="yates.html">family roots</a> were in 
        Albany. He was the eldest of the twelve children of Albany-born Schenectady 
        merchant Joseph Yates and Maria Dunbar - the daughter of a <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> 
        soldier who became a Schenectady vintner.</p>
      <p>Early on, he learned the craft of the surveyor and then began to train 
        for a career in <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>. <a href="#signature"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/ryatessig.jpg" hspace=1 vspace=1 width=250 alt="signature of Robert Yates" align=right border=0></a> 
        After <a href="ryates.html#clerk">clerking</a> for <a href="../l/wmlivingston.html">William 
        Livingston</a> in New York City, in 1760 he was licensed to practice on 
        his own. In 1765, he married <a href="../vn/javness965.html">Jannetje 
        Van Ness</a> and settled in Albany. Their first home was on the hillside 
        in the Second Ward where he had inherited property from his grandfather 
        and namesake - Robert Yates of Schenectady. Their six children were baptized 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> between 1767 and 
        1783 where both parents would become lifetime members.</p>
      <p>Surveying supplemented an insurgent attorney's income as he made a number 
        of important <a href="ryates.html#maps">land maps</a> during the 1760s. 
        He drew the first <a href="../../lastdays.html">civilian map</a> of Albany 
        in 1770. He also relied on patronage from the <a href="../../corporation.html">Albany 
        Corporation</a> through his uncle, alderman <a href="ayjr.html">Abraham 
        Yates, Jr</a>. In 1771, he was elected to the Common Council as an alderman 
        for the second ward. In those years he served on a number of committees, 
        provided legal advice, and stepped forward to compile and issue the first 
        published version of the <a href="../../doc/laws.html"><i>Laws and Ordinances 
        of the City of Albany</i></a> in 1773. Enjoying a growing legal practice 
        and gaining repute as an attorney, Robert Yates prospered.
      <p> 
      <p>From the beginning of the struggle for American liberties he stood in 
        the front ranks of Albany's Patriot leaders. Although he did not sign 
        the Albany <a href="../../solconst.html">Sons of Liberty constitution</a> 
        of 1766, he was prominent in the local resistance to the Stamp Act. By 
        1774, he had joined the Albany Committee of Correspondence and stood among 
        its first members when the committee's activities became public in 1775. 
        At that time, he was still a member of the Albany common council - although 
        its activities were being replaced by the extralegal Committee of Correspondence, 
        Safety, and Protection. He represented the second ward on the committee 
        and was in close contact with it from his subsequent offices until it 
        ceased operations in 1778. At the same time, he also served as secretary 
        of the Board of Indian Commissioners - a post that required him to travel 
        to the frontier.</p>
      <p>Robert Yates was an exceptional Albany resident called to service beyond 
        the local level. Beginning in the spring of 1775, he was elected to represent 
        Albany in each of the four New York Provincial Congresses. The first three 
        met in New York while the last one, convened after the Declaration of 
        Independence, met under duress in locations throughout the Hudson Valley. 
        In 1776-77, he served on the committee that drafted the first New York 
        State Constitution and also was a member of the "Secret Committee for 
        Obstructing Navigation of the Hudson."</p>
      <p>In October 1777, Yates was appointed to the New York State Supreme Court. 
        Through the darkest days of the struggle, Yates traveled the state - sitting 
        on the court and otherwise aiding the American cause. Although he often 
        was away from Albany, his family continued to grow as two sons were born 
        during the war years.</p>

      <p>With the end of the war, Robert Yates's family settled into a new home 
        on <a  href="../../census1790.html#ryates">upper State Street</a>. Although 
        principally an associate justice of the state Supreme Court, Yates maintained 
        a modest legal practice and continued surveying as well. During the 1780s, 
        his political star continued to rise in the "party" of Governor George 
        Clinton as he spoke in opposition to the expansion of the scope of a national 
        government. In 1787, he was appointed with <a href="../l/jolansing3755.html">John 
        Lansing, Jr.</a> and Alexander Hamilton to represent New York at the Philadelphia 
        convention to revise the Articles of Confederation. Arriving in Philadelphia, 
        Yates and Lansing felt the mood of the convention to produce an entirely 
        new form of government was beyond their authority. After sending a letter 
        to Governor Clinton urging opposition to the new Constitution, they returned 
        home. Yates is thought to have written a number of published essays in 
        opposition to its adoption. His <a href="#notes">personal notes</a> from 
        the Philadelphia convention were published in 1821.</p>
      <p>In 1788, Robert Yates was elected as an antifederalist delegate to the 
        New York State ratifying convention and worked against adoption of the 
        Constitution. But, after its acceptance, he pledged his support as a matter 
        of patriotic duty.</p>
      <p>In 1789, he ran for governor against George Clinton with the support 
        of the New York Federalists - who viewed him as a reasonable, potentially 
        kindred spirit who was not from a wealthy family. He was defeated by Governor 
        Clinton. Approached by the Federalists again in 1792, Yates refused to 
        run citing the financial drain caused by past politicking. In the gubernatorial 
        <a href="ryates.html#1795">campaign of 1795</a>, considerable sentiment 
        existed for Yates's candidacy as he was firmly established in the center 
        of the former antifederal party. John Jay defeated him in a close election 
        ending Yates's political career. By then, he already had devoted himself 
        to the law.</p>
      <p>In September 1790, Robert Yates was chosen Chief Justice of the New York 
        State Supreme Court. He served until the mandatory retirement age of sixty 
        in 1798. Unlike many "new men of the Revolution," he did not attain great 
        wealth and retired to his middling Albany <a href="../../census1800.html#ry">home</a>.</p>
      <p>Revolutionary leader, Robert Yates enjoyed a distinguished career in 
        the law and in public service. Enjoying great stature during his lifetime, 
        he was widely regarded as the most moderate of the Antifederalists. He 
        died in 1801 at the age of sixty three. His widow died in 1818. Their 
        son, jurist <a href="jvnyates.html">John Van Ness Yates</a>, succeeded 
        to Robert Yates's legal practice and lived in the State Street home.</p>

      <p><a name=signature><b>Autograph</b> of Robert Yates as reproduced in the 
        <a href="../../sources.html#jp"><i>Johnson Papers</i></a>.</a> 
      <p>Information on Yates's <b>clerkship</b> comes from Alfred F. Young, <i>The 
        Democratic Republicans of New York: The Origins, 1763-1797</i> (Chapel 
        Hill, 1967). Young's seminal study is also the source of the best insights 
        on Robert Yates and his career.</p>
      <p><a name="maps"></a>Yates drew a number of <b>maps</b> in newly formed 
        Tryon County. In 1773, he surveyed the <a href="../../na/westen.html">Westenhook 
        Patent</a> and later, with John R. Bleecker, the city's lands at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 
        His 1770 map of Albany was submitted along with a written report on the 
        city's boundary lines. In 1786, he was appointed to the commission that 
        finally fixed the boundary between New York and Massachusetts.</p>
      <p><a name="yateshouse"></a>The <b>Yates house</b> at 110 <a href="../../streets.html#state">State 
        Street</a> stood until 1855.</p>

        <i>Secret Proceedings and Debates of the Convention Assembled . . . for 
        the Purpose of Forming the Constitution of the United States</i> provide 
        important insights on the process that led to the development of the constitution.</p>
