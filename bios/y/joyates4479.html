          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Johannes Yates</B></A> was born in October 
            1716. He was the son of Albany blacksmith <a href="chyates4407.html">Christoffel 
            Yates</a> and his wife, <a href="../w/cawinne2824.html">Catharina 
            Winne</a> Yates.</P>

          <P>Following a <a href="yates.html">family pattern</a>, Johannes grew up 
            at his father's smithy learning the blacksmith's trade that would 
            ensure his place in Albany society for years to come.</P>

          <p>He married Albany native <a href="../w/rewaldron672.html">Rebecca Waldron</a> 
            in November 1737. Over the next eighteen years, their eight children 
            were baptized in the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch church</a> 
            where both parents were members.</p>

          <p>By the time of his marriage, he had joined a number of kin working as Albany 
            blacksmiths. John's family seems to have <a href="../../census1756.html#2">shared 
            a home</a> with his parents where John succeeded his father at the 
            forge and also as a firemaster in the city's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
            ward</a>. By the time of his father's death in 1754, he had acquired 
            additional property - a stables in the first ward and a farm across 
            the river in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.</p>

          <p>Fifty-nine-year-old John Yates made his <a href="../../wills/willjoyates4479.html">will</a> in December 1775. At that time, 
            he identified himself as the proprietor of a Greenbush farm and its 
            two-acre orchard and as the owner of another farm in the manor as 
            well. He was able to provide for his wife and to enrich the lives 
            of his six living children. He died early in 1776. His son, <a href="chjyates4459.html">Christopher 
            J. Yates</a>, inherited his father's blacksmith's tools.</P>
