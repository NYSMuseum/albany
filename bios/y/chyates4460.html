      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Christopher A. Yates</b></a> was born in April 
        1739. He was the second son born to Albany shoemaker <a href="adyates4402.html">Adam 
        Yates</a> and his wife, <a href="../g/angerr6014.html">Anna Gerritsen</a> 
        Yates. </p>
      <p>In Jauly 1766, he married schoolteacher's daughter <a href="../w/cawaters6820.html">Catharina 
        Waters</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where 
        he was a longtime member and pewholder. By 1776, seven children had been 
        christened at the Albany church. His eldest <a href="jwyates.html">son</a> 
        graduated from Columbia and was a banker and revered classical scholar.</p>
		
<p>This Yates family set up their home at the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany in a district that later became known as <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.         However, he later paid taxes on a substantial building along Market Street which he used for business.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1760">1760</a>, he served as a constable in the <a href="">third ward</a>. At the outbreak 
        of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, he was 
        identified as a "freeholder in Albany." Sometimes called "Lieutenant" 
        Yates, he was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">exempted</a> from active 
        duty by the governor in 1778. In August, he was identified as a wagon 
        master on a <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#4460">list</a> of mostly older 
        Albany men serving under the Quartermaster General. Later, he received 
        a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction 
        with the first (Albany) regiment of the county militia.</p>
      <p>After the war, he returned to his Market Street home that stood <a href="../../census1790.html#4460">beyond</a> 
        the northern bounds of the city.</p>
<p>Christopher buried his wife in 1791. He was in his fifties and probably was absorbed in the household of one of his grown children. However, he still owned a house and a stables in the third ward that was destroyed in the great <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">fire of 1797</a>. 

<p>Christopher A. Yates died in November 1809 at the age of seventy-one. The newspaper notice called him "an old and respectable inhabitant." He was buried in the Dutch church 
        cemetery plot.</p>
