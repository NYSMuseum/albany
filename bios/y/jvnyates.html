        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of John Van Ness 
        <a href="yates.html">Yates</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 4483. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived 
        chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and 
        <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The most extensive 
        sketch of his life appears in the <a href="../../sources.html#ht"><i>Bicentennial 
        History of Albany</i></a>, pp. 134-35. Because of the lifespan (1779-1839) 
        of this important personage, we are unable to <a href="../../cbr.html#parameters">actively 
        pursue</a> his story! 
        <p><a name=character></a> Gorham A. Worth later <b>characterized him</b> 
          as "a man of talents, both natural and acquired. He was equal to the 
          duties of any station, and to the difficulties of any task. He was a 
          wit, a poet, a belles-lettres scholar, and a boon companion, whose joke 
          was ever ready, and whose laugh was contagious. He wanted nothing but 
          industry and self-respect, [sic] to have made him eminent as a lawyer. 
          His associations were beneath him, not only in point of talent, but 
          in character; yet they affected his interests rather than his principles. 
          He possessed the readiest apprehension and the most retentive memory, 
          of any man I ever knew. All that he had ever read, and he had read a 
          great deal, was at his fingers ends. He was often consulted by the younger 
          members of the bar, while walking in the streets; and, without a moment's 
          hesitation, would take out his pencil and write down what was the law 
          in the case, and where it was to be found - volume, chapter and verse. 
          From these frequent street consultations, he was called The Walking 
          LIbrary." Printed in Worth's <a href="../../sources.html#rr"><i>Random 
          Recollections of Albany</i></a> pp. 65-66.</p>
