<P>Based on <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional ources, Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">res</a>ident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Adam Russ</strong></a> was born in 1774. He is <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/amasa-j-amasa-junius-parker/landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek/page-100-landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek.shtml">said</a> to have been a native of Germantown, NY and to have settled in Albany about 1790. His name has been <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled variously - especially as "Rose." Although probably of <a href="../ger.html">German</a> (Palatine) heritage, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>His wife was <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Elizabeth Lewis. In September 1802, his son "John Peter Russ," was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Children were christened there in 1806 and 1808.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#adru">1800</a>, the second ward household of "Adam Rose" appeared on the city census for the second ward. At that time, his household consisted of a couple (aged 24-46) and one boy under ten. In 1802, his (Rose) house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick Street</a> was valued moderately. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> and afterwards, his household of as many as nine residents was configured on the Albany census.

<p>Beginning in August <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">1805</a>, he purchased <a href="../../res/realestate.html">city lots</a> beyond the most settled areas mostly from their previous owners rather than from the city <a href="../../corporation.html">corp</a>oration. These included properties along Patroon and Spruce Streets and on the Albany-Schenectady <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a>. 

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=%22adam+russ%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=russ&f=false">1813</a>, the city directory listed him as a cartman residing at 101 Fox Street. By 1820, he had relocated to 33 then 40 <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick</a> Street. During those years the directory identified him as a licensed cartman and collector of taxes for the second ward, noted that he held the positions of "weigher of fish and iron and measurer of salt," and also that he was "doorkeeper" of the "Washington Benevolent Society."

<p>The Russ family (probably beginning with this subject's son) was prominent in Albany business (<a href="http://albany.nygenweb.net/sketch-r.htm">plumbing</a>) even while this Adam was still living.

<p>Adam Russ died in June 1862 at the age of 87. The <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> of "Adam Roos" was probated in Albany County in January 1867.
