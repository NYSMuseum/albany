<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit Roseboom</b></a> was born about 1665. He was the son of Albany founders <a href="heroseboom1622.html">Hendrick Janse</a> and <a href="../l/gylansing3332.html">Gysbertje Lansing</a> Roseboom.</p>


<p>In November 1689, he married <a href="../s/masanders1434.html">Maria Sanders</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1704, their six children had been christened in the church where both parents were members and baptism sponsors. In 1714, the altruistic Gerrit also contributed to the building of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.</p>

<p>Gerrit Roseboom was a merchant and a <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1609">prosperous</a> member of Albany's business <a href="../../census1697.html#157">community</a>. He set up his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where he served as constable, assessor, assistant, and then as alderman - beginning in 1709. While a member of the city <a  href="../../corporation.html">council</a>, he supervised a number of public construction projects. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html">1699</a>, he signed a community document pledging allegiance to the king of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1609">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>He also commanded a company in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. The roster from <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a> details its  structure and composition.</p>

<p>Gerrit Roseboom died in 1739 and was buried from the Dutch church. His wife lived two years longer.</p>
