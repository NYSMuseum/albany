<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Ryckman</b></a> was born about 1670. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Abraham Janse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Cornelia Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. She grew up along the waterfront where the Ryckman brewery was an Albany <a href="ajryckman1905.html#brew">landmark</a>.</p>


<p>In June 1692, she married <a href="../b/anbries6333.html">Anthony Bries</a>. By 1703, six children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and occasional baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>This Bries family lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and for two decades were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#110">mainstays</a>.</p>

<p>Anthony Bries wrote out his <a href="../../wills/willanbries6333.html">will</a> in November 1703. It made Catharina its executor and chief beneficiary. He died in November 1704. The will passed probate in February 1705.</p>



<p>Catharina Ryckman Bries lived in their comfortable Albany home for several decades. Her property was taxed on the assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1911">1709</a>. She was alive in December 1736 when she was <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">bequeathed</a> part of her father's estate. She died sometime thereafter!</p>
