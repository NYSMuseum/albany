<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Roseboom, Jr.</b></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the son of Albany pioneers <a href="heroseboom1622.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../l/gylansing3332.html">Gysbertie Lansing</a> Roseboom.</p>


<p>In November 1694, he married <a href="../s/destaats4565.html">Debora Staats</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor. By 1715, seven children had been baptized in Albany.</p>

<p>These Rosebooms lived near other family households along upper <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in Albany's second ward. In <a href="../../census1697.html#148">1697</a>, his budding household was included on the city census. Two years later, he joined his neighbors in pledging <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#1655">allegiance</a> to the king of England. He was a trader and member of the Albany <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">business community</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1655">1720</a>, he was listed among the qualified voters of the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.</p>

<p>Over several decades, he served the community as juror, constable, contractor, surveyor, assessor, and assistant alderman. From 1720 to 1729, he was elected alderman in the second ward. In 1715, he was identified as an ensign in Gerrit Roseboom's <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In 1702 and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1655">1709</a>, his second ward property was valued comparably to that of other Albany merchants.</p>

<p>The name of Hendrick Roseboom, Jr. dropped from Albany rolls after he witnessed a baptism in August 1737. His wife lived until 1749.</p>
