<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Regal</strong></a> was born about 1740. The range of <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elling variants encountered keep us from comprehending his origins. However, perhaps they were Mohawk Valley <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NYPCUJQvP6UC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=%22william+rhigel%22&source=bl&ots=IUBP44tIkU&sig=N_Bacjwrtzv338Mht8x4Pa1cvQE&hl=en&ei=SQhPTMPYCsKB8gb70PW4Bg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20rhigel%22&f=false">Germans</a>.

<p>In December 1765, William "Rhigel" married <a href="chroff1501.html">Charlotte Roff</a> (Phaff) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Children have not been encountered in the available records of the early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his Albany property was valued modestly. In September of that year he had signed a deed for a lot he had previously purchased "where the barracks stood." The house lot was number three on the west side of Chapel Street extending to Lodge and between State and Maiden Lane. Much later, in 1798, <a href="../b/jabarkley7208.html">James B</a>arkley <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">sold</a> that lot ("Wm. Regal's lot") to Catharine Van Cortlandt.

<p>One posthumous bit of information identified him as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. 

<p>In 1767, the name of William "Real" appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1768">1768</a>, he was named constable for the second ward and then high constable. However, in December 1771, he was removed from that post as he "has removed out of the city." 

<p>After 1771, his name dropped from the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based record</a>. It also has not been located in the available records generated by the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>. However, Charlotte Regal appears to have remained in Albany for a number of years.

<p>William Regal was dead by March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1501">1779</a> when his widow was listed on the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> assessment roll. In February 1781, he was identified as a deceased baker of Albany and his probable brother-in-law <a href="../r/joroff1026.html">John Raff</a> was appointed to <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">administer</a> the Regal estate.</p>
