      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Rogers, Jr.</strong></a> was born 
        in December 1709. He was the son of former solder <a href="wmrogers.html">William 
        Rogers</a> and his wife, Mary Johnson Rogers. He grew up in a hatter's 
        home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. 
      <p>In February 1738, "William Radtgert, Jr." married Mary Werth or White 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. During the 1740s, 
        at least two children were christened at that church. Later, he was a 
        member and church warden at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> 
        Anglican church. In 1765, he joined the <a href="../b/thbrown7460.html">minister</a> 
        in petitioning the city council for land on which to build a parsonage. 
      <p>Although his namesake father may have lived into the 1740s, we believe 
        that community-based information simply for "William Rogers" from the 
        1740s on probably relates to the life of William Rogers, Jr. Thus, in 
        <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#wrjr">1742</a>, his name appeared 
        on a list of freeholders living in the third ward. 
      <p>In August 1746, "William Rogers" witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willroroseboom.html">will</a> 
        of <a href="roroseboom1952.html">Ro</a>bert Roseboom. In July 1747, "Jr." 
        witnessed the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&jtp=297#PPA297,M1">will</a> 
        of another Albany neighbor, widow Anna Poffie. A year later, his house 
        in the third ward was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> 
        of Dirck Ten Broeck. That home was on Market Street between the home of 
        Roseboom and the Ten Broecks. 
      <p>In 1756, the <a href="../../census1756.html#284">census</a> identified 
        him as a <a href="../../trades/hatter.html">hatter</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#wrjr">1763</a>, 
        his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>, 
        his third ward property was accorded a moderate but substantial assessment 
        (ten pounds). In that year, he applied for and received a lot located 
        south of Foxes Creek "to hold a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning</a> 
        pit there until it becomes useless." In November 1787, the Council declared 
        that Rogers (along with many others) had held land there since 1768, that 
        they had improved the tanning pit lots, and that they should continue 
        to hold the property until the pits have become useless. That was the 
        last recorded reference to William Rogers.</p>
      <p>However, in June 1777, he was among those "<a href="../../sources.html#cc">prisoners</a>" 
        who took the oath of allegiance and was discharged. In May 1778, a William 
        Rogers (turning seventy, a resident of Hoosic and a yeoman, and a <b>former 
        resident of Albany</b> - with a large family), was a convicted horse thief. 
        "Destitute," he <a href="../../doc/petwmrogers.html">petitioned</a> the 
        governor for mercy and relief. Three days earlier, his wife, Mary, presented 
        a similar petition. In November 1779, he still was incarcerated. His teen-aged 
        son, <a href="benrogers.html">Benjamin</a>, was similarly charged. 
      <p>A surprising number of individuals of this name (representing a number 
        of distinct family lines) seem to be at risk at this time and in this 
        region. This William Rogers, Jr. would have been seventy in 1779! <br>
      <dd>Perhaps a second William Rogers, Jr. was named third ward constable 
        in 1762 and married "Geertruy Reily" at the Albany Dutch church in June 
        1764.</p>
