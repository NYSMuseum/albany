<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick M. Roseboom</b></a> was born in September 1707. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="myroseboom1950.html">Myndert</a> and <a href="../v/mavinhagen3425.html">Maria Vinhagen</a> Roseboom. He was widely known as "Hendrick M. Roseboom." His father died in 1722 but this individual enjoyed a long life.</p>


<p>In October 1734, he married Albany native <a href="../t/mate4899.html">Maria Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1746, their five children had been christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Like other members of both of their families, these Rosebooms were prominent residents of Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and mainline members of the Albany business community. He served as firemaster, assistant, and alderman (1762). Community-based <a href="../../census1756.html#15">documents</a> identified him as a freeholder, <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#1659">merchant</a>, and householder with city property <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> comparably to that of other Albany businessmen. In 1767, he also captained an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.</p>

<p>In 1772, he was named overseer of the powder house. Three years later, he still was referenced in connection with the powderhouse.</p>

<p>After that, the name of Hendrick M. Roseboom may have dropped from Albany rolls. However, he may have lived for several more decades as survey information for "Hendrick Roseboom" appears in a number of places. The <a href="../../wills/willheroseboom1659.html">will</a> of Hendrick M. Roseboom of Albany was filed on July 7, 1790. It named no wife but did provide for his three living sons.</p>
