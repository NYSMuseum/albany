<strong>Albert Ryckman, Jr.</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was an older son in the large family of <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Conelia Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. He grew up around his father's <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewery</a> on the Albany riverfront. 

<p>He probably did not marry but occasionally witnessed a baptism at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He probably <a href="../../census1697.html#048">lived</a> with his father and brothers at the family brewery.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">1701</a>, he signed a petition addressed to the provincial governor. He was identifed as "Albert Ryckman, Jr."

<p>His name was not included with those of his <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1905">father</a> and brothers in any of the jurisdictions on the <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">list</a> of Albany County freeholders taken in 1720.

<p>Albert Ryckman, Jr. died in 1722 and was buried on October 10. No mention of him or of any of his heirs was made in the <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1736.</p>
