<strong>Robert Roseboom</strong></a> was born in May 1693. He was the eldest son of Albany mainstays <a href="geroseboom1609.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../s/masanders1434.html">Maria Sanders</a> Roseboom. He was named for his mother's prominent <a href="../s/rosanders.html">father</a>. He grew up in a merchant's home in Albany's second ward.

<p>In December 1743, he was fifty when he married his forty-three-year-old cousin, <a href="ryroseboom1953.html">Ryckie Roseboom</a>, at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Probably due to the ages of the marriage partners, no children have appeared on Albany church rolls. Both partners, however, were church members and baptism sponsors.

<p>In 1715, he served in his father's <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. As early as 1723, his name appeared on lists of Albany merchants interested in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1733">1733</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1952">1742</a> and again in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1952">1763</a>, he was counted among Albany's freeholders. In 1753, he was paid for wood his "negro" helped bring to the city in 1745. The <a href="../../census1756.html#285">census</a> of Albany householders taken in 1756 identified him as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchant</a>.

<p>In 1723, Robert Roseboom was <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/16.html">referenced</a> in an action involving the fur trade out of Schenectady.

<p>We <a href="../../inprog.html">have not</a> investigated his real estate <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~acastleman/castleman/cas2_joh_dietrich_grp/cas3_andreas_ludwig_grp/cas3_andreas_ludwig_story.htm">enterprises</a> beyond Albany.

<p>Robert Roseboom filed a <a href="../../wills/willroroseboom.html">will</a> in August 1746. It named his wife but not children as his heirs. Also recognized were his five living siblings. He was buried in February 1764 and the will passed probate in April.</p>
