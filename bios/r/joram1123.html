<P>Spelled variously,

<strong>John Ram</strong></a> (also Johan Otto Rham) probably was born about 1740. We suspect that he was a native of Germany.

<p>In March 1765, he married "Catherine Barbara Hoogstrettein" (<a href="../h/cahog8493.html">Catharina Hogstrasser</a>) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1779, at least four children had been christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. He does not appear to have been associated with the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. In December of 1765, he was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> - meaning he had not been born in a part of the British Empire.

<p>Ram may have been the "Johns Baker" listed in the house of Bogardus on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> roll in 1766. By <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1123">1779</a>, he was identified as the owner of a house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> and of a <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1123jr">lot</a> along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. He maintained that <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1123">property</a> on what became lower <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a> for the remainder of his life.

<p>In August 1775, the <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;rgn=full%20text;idno=ABP1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000239">Albany committee</a> noted that his child had smallpox. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. Otherwise, except for a small contribution for relief in 1775, his name has not yet been encountered on the records of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> Albany. In his thirties for most of that time, we <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> to account for John Ram's wartime activities.

<p>Even though he had been living in Albany for more than a decade, in <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#1123">1781</a>, he was identified as a baker and was among those <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> who purchased the freedom of the city.  

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1123">1790</a>, Ram's household included Catherine and three other females. A <a href="../../census1800.html#1123">decade later</a>, they were joined by a younger man and a young girl for a total of seven household members.
 
<p>In July 1803, John Ram was one of three leading members of the apparently defunct German Reformed Church who successfully <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/9615437/Annals-of-Albany-Vol-I">petitioned</a> the Dutch church leaders to permit their deceased kin to be re-interred in the Dutch church plot. "Johannis Ram" was buried from the Dutch church on January 1, 1805. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in June. His widow lived on in the home at 31 Columbia Street until her death in February 1826.</p>
