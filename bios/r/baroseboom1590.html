      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent Roseboom</strong></a> was born in 
        October 1736. He was the son of <a href="heroseboom1659.html">Hendrick 
        M.</a> and <a href="../t/mate4899.html">Maria Ten Eyck</a> Roseboom. He 
        grew up in businessman's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a>. 
<p>In October 1759, a Barent Roseboom (perhaps he was the sole individual at-risk) was <a href="http://papertrails.us/colonial_wars">serving</a> in the British supply corps under <a href="../g/wmgamble.html">William Gamble</a> at Fort Herkimer. 
      <p>He was a bachelor but a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>Barent also was a homeowner in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>. He was known as a skipper and also called a mariner - implying 
        that he <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sailed</a> beyond the river. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a>, he was appointed firemaster. 
        He served in that capacity again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1779">1779</a> 
        - but then for the first ward. In 1782, he was appointed chimney viewer. 
        He also was reimbursed for services by the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#1590">1766</a>, he joined with his neighbors 
        in protest of the Stamp Act when he signed the constitution of the Albany 
        Sons of Liberty. At the outbreak of the war in 1775, he was offered a 
        commission as lieutenant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. He declined stating that he was too old. Afterwards, he received 
        a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the 
        Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>After the war, he seems to have <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1590">lived</a> 
        with his brother, Hendrick. In <a href="../../census1790.html#first">1790</a>, 
        he was accounted for in Hendrick's first ward household. 
      <p>Barent Roseboom <a href="#will">filed</a> a <a href="../../wills/willbaroseboom1590.html">will</a> 
        in December 1795. He stated that he was a bachelor, weak of body but "sound 
        of mind." By that time, he was living in Canajoharie in Montgomery County. 
        His estate was to be divided among his nieces and nephews - children of 
        his brothers. Included in his holdings was a lot on the hill in Albany 
        then held by <a href="../b/sabromley5963.html">Sam Bromley</a>. Barent 
        Roseboom died in February 1796 - months shy of his sixtieth birthday. 
        He was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=43163430">buried</a> 
        in Canahoharie.</p>
