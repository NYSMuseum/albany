      <P><a href="../../or/or-3r.html">W</a>artime prisoner <a href="#sources"><strong>Benjamin 
        Rogers</strong></a> was born during the early 1760s. He may have been 
        the son of Albany hatter <a href="wmrogersjr.html">William Rogers, Jr.</a> 
        At this time, we are <a href="../qqqq.html">uncertain</a> regarding his 
        <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 
      <p>By the 1770s, this Rogers family had become residents of Hoosick. 
      <p>In 1778, seventeen-year-old Benjamin was in trouble. In May, a <a href="../../doc/petbenrogers.html">petition</a> 
        on his behalf, was sent to Governor George Clinton. It was signed by fifty-two 
        prominent, mostly city-based residents. It stated that he had spent six 
        months in prison for stealing a horse and currently was facing a death 
        sentence. 
      <p>Perhaps this individual became a <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/rogers/messages/10251.html">resident</a> 
        of the <a href="../../na/sarapat.html">Saratoga Patent</a> a few years 
        later. He is said to have died intestate in Saratoga in 1806.</p>

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Benjamin Rogers 
        has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
        This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. So many important Albany personages testifying on his behalf 
        in 1778 leads us to guess that he perhaps was the son (or another kinsman) 
        of the long-time <a href="wmrogersjr.html">Albany hatter</a> who also 
        was charged with rustling cattle at that time! </div>
