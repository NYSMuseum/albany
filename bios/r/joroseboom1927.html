 <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes M. Roseboom</strong></a> was born 
        in January 1716. He was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="myroseboom1950.html">Myndert</a> 
        and <a href="../v/mavinhagen3425.html">Maria Vinhagen</a> Roseboom. To 
        prevent confusion, he was known pretty consistently as "Johannes M. Roseboom." 
        He grew up in a modest home near "Roseboom's Gate" in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> but lost his father in 
        1722. His mother <a href="../../census1756.html#3">survived</a> until 1760 
        when Johannes arranged for her <a href="../../dead.html">burial</a>. Several 
        of his siblings also became prominent Albany residents. 

<p>His wife was Albany native <a href="../m/evmarselis699.html">Eva Marselis</a> - daughter 
        of an alderman. Their marriage appears to have been childless. They 
        occasionally witnessed baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1743">1743</a>, he was appointed constable 
        for the second ward. Following his mother's death in 1760, he appears 
        to have become head of an Albany household. Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> 
        for the 1760s and 1770s taxed his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> 
        holdings substantially. In 1763, his name appeared on a <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1927">list</a> 
        of Albany freeholders. 

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1927">1779</a>, John R. Roseboom's <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> house and personal property were valued substantially.  Other city parcels for "John Roseboom" were also assessed but several same-named individuals appear at risk at that time.

<p>Calling him "my friend," <a href="../w/ewesterlo.html">Domine Westerlo</a> 
        was moved to <a href="../../books.html#rn">note</a> that, in April 1783, 
        "Johannes M. Roseboom died of the stone, in the Lord, I hope." Westerlo 
        then prayed for Roseboom's widow. In 1786, Eva's name appeared on a list 
        of subscribers for the Dutch church. In <a   href="../../census1790.html#699">1790</a>, 
        she was identified as the head of a third ward household. </p>
