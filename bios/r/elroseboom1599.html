<strong>Elizabeth Roseboom</strong></a> was born in June 1697. She was the daughter of Albany mainstays <a href="heroseboom1655.html">Hendrick Roseboom, Jr.</a> and <a href="../s/destaats4565.html">Debora Staats</a> Roseboom. She grew up and lived for a long time in her father's house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In December 1735, she married fifty-two-year-old widower <a href="../vs/divschell6434.html">Dirck Van Schelluyne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. That marriage produced only one child who became a prominent and long-lived Albany <a href="../vs/covschell5647.html">resident</a>.

<p>Although Dirck Van Schelluyne died in 1759, in <a href="../../census1756.html#124">1756</a>, "Mrs. Scurlion" (Elizabeth was <a href="../../res/guess.html">per</a>haps the only Mrs. at risk) was acknowledged as the head of their household until Cornelis reached adulthood.

<p>In 1765, she was identified as sixty-eight years old when she was questioned by the court about an <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html#will">incident</a> that occurred when she was fifteen. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, she was named on the city assessment roll with her son as the owner of one of the more valuable pieces of property in the city. Elizabeth Roseboom Van Schelluyne died sometime thereafter.</p>
