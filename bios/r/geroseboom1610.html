<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit J. Roseboom</b></a> was born in February 1697. He was a younger child from the marriage of Albany natives <a href="joroseboom1671.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../c/gecoster.html">Gerritje Coster</a> Roseboom. His father was a onetime frontier trader who, by the time Gerrit was born, had settled into a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.</p>

<p>In 1727, he followed in his father's footsteps when he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a> for the second ward. He was re-elected in 1728. In 1733, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. His father lived until 1745. As a young adult, Gerrit may lived with his parents! 

<p>In November 1737, he was among those named in the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> filed by his father. 
 
<p>Perhaps he did not marry as no children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a pewholder. However, he seems to have been an Albany mainstay during the middle quarters of the eighteenth century as his name appeared on a list of qualified voters (freeholders) in  <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1742fl">1742</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#122">1756</a>, he was identifed on the census as a merchant and householder. His second ward properties were listed on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> from the 1760s.</p>

<p>Gerrit J. Roseboom filed a <a href="#will">will</a> in October 1774. It noted that he died "about the 26th day of Oct. 1777." It listed his heirs - none of whom seem to be his direct descendants. The will passed probate in March 1788. The subsequent inventory described monies, book debts, and personal property.</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Gerrit J. Roseboom is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1610. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="roseboom.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. He typically was known as Gerrit J., or Gerrit Joh., or as Gerrit Jr. to prevent confusion with an older <a href="geroseboom1609.html">uncle</a> of the same name.</p>

<p><a name=will>The <b>will</b> is noted in <a href="../../sources.html#en"><i>Abstract of the Wills . . . </i></a>, pp. 114, 116. An inventory <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="inventory to be transformed and added"></a> of his remaining estate consists of sums of currency, debts owed his estate, and some personal items. It was made at the request of his executors in December 1788.</p>
