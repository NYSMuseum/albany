<P>Born about 1654, <A href="#biography"><B>Jan Rosie</B></A> was a prominent <a href="../french.html">French-ancestry</a> resident of colonial Albany. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.</p>

          <p> By 1671, he was identified as a "Frenchman" living in Albany when he was called 
            before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> to answer 
            questions about the Mohawks and the French. During that time, he appears 
            to have been moving between New York, New France, and the <a href="../indians.html">Indian</a> 
            country. Because of his perceived nationality, he occasioned more 
            scrutiny than most other <a href="../../newcomers.html">new</a>comers 
            - thus creating another set of records absent from the lives of people of similar means. In 1679, he <a href="#french">swore</a> allegiance 
            to the King of England and applied to the Albany magistrates for a 
            cartman's license.</P>

<p>During the 1680s, he acquired a houselot on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">southside</a>. He also "owned" Albany pasture land. Later in the decade, he purchased two farm parcels on the Mohawk at <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a>. By 1683, he had joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and was considered one of its principal members. With his wife, <a href="#elizabeth">Elizabeth</a>, he witnessed a number of church baptisms.</p>

          <p>Jan Rosie was known more widely as an interpreter who frequently traveled to 
            New France on Albany's behalf. Those travels were a risky business! 
            In 1687, he was imprisoned in Canada for five weeks. As war with the 
            French became more imminent, he was examined by New York authorities 
            but found to be a "very honest man."</p>

<p>Over the next decade, he often was called on to carry dispatches to Canada while building a successful life in Albany's first ward. In <a href="../../census1697.html#019">1697</a>, Jan and Elizabeth were alone in their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home. He served the community as a juror, <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, surveyor, constable, and high constable. By the early 1700s, his holdings were <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6456">valued</a> in the top quarter of the community's wealth.</p>

<p>In June 1718, the <a href="../../wills/willkvr5054.html">will</a> of the Patroon noted that Rosie was in possession of a plot of pasture land in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, his name did appear on a list of freeholders living in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. That should mean that he was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> as a British subject. We still <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> documentation of that proceedure. 

<p>Elizabeth Rosie died in 1726. Jan lived on in his Albany home for more than a decade. Sick and alone, he filed a <a href="../../wills/willjrosie.html">will</a> in June 1737 that left his diversified estate to various friends and neighbors. This long-time Albany resident was buried beneath the Dutch church on November 1, 1737.</p>

            <A name=biography></a>The life of <B>Jan Rosie</B> is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 6456. This profile is derived 
            chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. 
            He was sometimes referred to as "Jean de la Rose."</p>

          <p><a name=french></a><b>Origins:</b> Rosie may not have been a Roman Catholic as he 
            swore several oaths (which Catholics avoided) and was a member of 
            and contributor to the Albany Dutch (Calvinist) church. An affidavit 
            dated September 25, 1688 stated that he was about thirty-four-years-old, 
            understood French, and had accompanied <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck 
            Wesselse</a> to Canada three times that year. <a href="../../sources.html#nycd"><i>NYCD</i></a>, 
            3:563-64. Curiously, he was not identified as of French ancestry on 
            the <a href="../../census1697.html">census of 1697</a>.</p> 

<p><a name=elizabeth></a><b>Elizabeth Rosie:</b> Rosie's wife died in 1726. <a href="../qqqq.html#one">She</a> witnessed several baptisms with her husband in the Albany Dutch church. We seek information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and on childbearing! <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a></p>
