<strong>Conrad Ruby</strong></a> probably was born about 1730 and probably was of German ancestry. He was <a href="../../res/sp.html">some</a>times referred to as "John Conrad Ruby."


<p>In July 1761, he married <a href="../h/sahawke8371.html">Sarah Hawke</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. The marriage may have produced a number of children. During the 1760s and 70s, the Rubys were listed as sponsors of baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Later, he was a member, pewholder, and officer of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.

<p>Initially, he made his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where his property was accorded modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>. In 1785, he signed a fifteen year <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM00393.html">lease</a> for some property with <a href="../g/magerr6009.html">Maria Van Schaick</a>. At that time, he was identified as "of Rensselaerswyck." In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1056">1788</a>, his home was in Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1056">1790</a>, his <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> household included eight people. Just before his death, he also owned an additional second ward lot. 

<p>A developer's <a href="../../im/im1794.html#top">map</a> dated 1794, first showed "Ruby's Alley" as an L-shaped back street that straddled the northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a> and opened on the logical extensions of Barrack and Quackenbush Streets.  In 1785, he <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM00393.html">agreed</a> to property in Rensselaerswyck from "<a href="../vs/mavschaick3974.html">Mar</a>ia Van Schaick" at fifteen shillings a year for fifteen years.

<p>We seek defining information on Ruby's occupation. In 1788 and '89, he charged <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> for several days of work on Schuyler's grape vines. Perhaps he was a gardener.

<p>Ruby served in the colonial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia<a/> but appears to have not played an active part in the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">struggle</a> for Independence - probably because of <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#1056">age</a>. 


<p>Conrad Ruby was dead by 1800 when his wife was named as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">head</a> of their household. His will passed probate in February 1812. His widow lived on in their second ward home which in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1814</a> was located at 24 <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick</a> Street.</p>
