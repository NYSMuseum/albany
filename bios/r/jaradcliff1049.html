<strong>Jacobus Radcliff</strong></a> was born in September 1703. He was the son of <a href="joradcliff1060.html">John</a> and <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">Rachel Van Valkenburgh</a> Radcliff. This younger son grew up as part of a large family in the modest home of a one-time soldier on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany.

<p>In 1715, he would have been about thirteen when he was listed on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>About 1728, he married <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady area native <a href="../b/cabovie7384.html">Catharina Bovie</a>. Between 1729 and 1747, ten children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a frequent baptism sponsor and the church <a href="../../drc.html#sexton">sexton</a> as well. He may well have served as church sexton from 1729 until his death in 1766. From the frequent entries in the church burial records, it appears that a number of their children did not survive to adulthood.


<p>In  May 1730, Jacobus purchased a lot at the foot <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> from the city of "Albany. The lot measured thirty by one hundred twenty feet (the size of many Albany lots today).These Radcliffs made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Jacobus was a <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1049">free</a> <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1049">holder</a> and the bell ringer for more than three decades beginning in 1731 - following in the footsteps (no pun intended) of his parents. He also was <a href="../../corporation.html#retainers">paid</a> by the city and by the Dutch church for performing other tasks as well. During those years, he received periodic bequests from the Dutch church and from the city treasury.

<p>In 1756, he may have been the "Raliff" man who was identified as a <a href="#census">carman</a> on the census of householders.

<p>During the 1760s, his first ward house was accorded a modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a>. His son also was noted on the property but not by name. 

<p>Jacobus Radcliff probably died early in November 1766 as <a href="phriley1512.html">Philip Ryley</a> was paid twelve shillings on November 25 "for burying cobus Redley." In July 1767, "Catherine, the widow of Jacobus Radcliff," was involved in a real estate transaction. Puzzling information on an individual(s) named "Jacobus Radcliff" from the late 1760s on recommends <a href="../../inprog.html">caution</a> in the further development of this profile.
