      <P>The story of the <a href="#sources"><b>Roseboom</b></a> family in early 
        Albany begins with the appearance of <a href="heroseboom1622.html">Hendrick 
        Janse</a> in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> before 1660. 
        His marriage to <a href="../l/gylansing3332.html">Gysbertje Lansing</a> 
        established the family in the city and beyond. </p>
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a> the households of Hendrick 
        Sr. and four sons appeared on the Albany census. All five of these Rosebooms 
        were primarily <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a>. The portal 
        on the north side of the city stockade following Pearl Street was known 
        as "Roseboom's Gate."</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, five Roseboom men were 
        included on a list of city freeholders. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, 
        the number of Roseboom freeholders had grown to nine men. Unlike many 
        other <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>-era families, the Rosebooms 
        appear to have been almost exclusively <a href="../../criteria.html">resident</a> 
        in the city of Albany. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, eleven Roseboom-named households 
        appeared on the city census of householders including the home of "apothecary" 
        <a href="jaroseboom1665.html">Jacob Roseboom</a>. Three others were headed 
        by widows. At that time, the Rosebooms were among the most well-established 
        families in the city of Albany.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#names">1764</a>, a petition signed 
        by Albany merchants included the names of five family members including 
        <a href="myroseboom1951.html">Myndert H. Roseboom</a> - a prominent merchant 
        and Revolutionary war army officer.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, four Roseboom named households 
        remained in the city.</p>
      <p>In 1815, only the Hudson Avenue home of widow Hester Roseboom was listed 
        in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>. <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyotsego/ros.htm"><img src="../../images/jpg/maps/roseboom.jpg" align=right border=2 alt="town and village of Roseboom, Otsego County, NY" width=100 height=70 vspace=4 hspace=4></a> 
      <p>Since then, descendants of the Albany Rosebooms have spread across New 
        York and across the <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Roseboom-family-history.ashx">country</a> 
        as well. Over the years, Roseboom family members have <a href="http://www.threerivershms.com/roseboom.htm">recalled</a> 
        the family's earlier days in a number of interesting <a href="#sources">ways</a>.</p>
