<P><a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a>, one-time Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Roosevelt</strong></a> was born in New York in 1758. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fivegateways/alphabetical-index-r/roosevelt/rvlt0027">Thus</a>, he would have been the son (fifth child) of Nicholas and his second wife, Elizabeth Thurman Roosevelt of New York City. His father was a silver and goldsmith of <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections?ft=Roosevelt,+Nicholas+(American,+1715-1769)">some note</a>. He seems to have been confused with his <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/fivegateways/alphabetical-index-r/roosevelt/rvlt0017">father</a>, who is said to have died in 1769, and with a number of same-named individuals who were his contemporaries. This individual also was known as "Nicholas Roosevelt <a href="http://ourberryfamily.com/berry/43240.htm">IV</a>."

<p>By at least November 1758, his wife <a href="../../res/ts.html">may</a> have been Betsey English, the mother of at least six of their children - none of whom seem to have been <a href="../../drc.html">ch</a>ristened in Albany. Perhaps he married Dutchess County native Margaret Cramer in <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~ghosthunter/fam02344.html">1793</a>. She was the mother of six more of his children.

<p>Coming of age at the end of the 1770s, this Nicholas Roosevelt found himself in Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">American Revolution</a>. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information his <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">path</a> to Albany and on his wartime activities. 

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3913">1779</a>, his personal property was valued under the first ward home of <a href="../s/wmshep1155.html">William Shepherd</a>. That <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October</a>, his Albany property was assessed substantially.

<p>Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3913">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>By the late 1780s, the name of Nicholas Roosevelt had dropped from Albany rolls.

<p>He is said to have moved on to Stillwater and then to Warren County. Like his <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/47.70">father</a>, he is said to have been a goldsmith.

<p>Nicholas Roosevelt is said to have died in June 1838 at the age of seventy-nine. That individual was buried in the Methodist <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=22502504">churchyard</a> in Johnsburg, Warren County.</p>
