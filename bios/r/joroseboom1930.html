<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes H. Roseboom</strong></a> was born in October 1739. He was the son of <a href="heroseboom1659.html">Hendrick M.</a> and <a href="../t/mate4899.html">Maria Ten Eyck</a> Roseboom. As a number of same-named individuals (including the older Albany resident <a href="joroseboom1929.html">John H. Roseboom</a>) are at risk in greater Albany County, this sketch organizes information focused on the life of John H. Roseboom exclusively.

<p>This Johannes grew up a middle child in a moderate-size family of a second ward merchant. Both of his older brothers became Albany residents. However, John H. Roseboom found success elsewhere. 

<p>In May 1763, Johannes H. married Schenectady native Susanna Veeder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, he was identified as a silversmith of Albany County. By 1783, seven children had been christened at the Dutch church of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where these Rosebooms had taken up residence.

<p>For the next two decades, this Albany native was a <a href="http://archive.org/stream/16301897briefhis00rose#page/30/mode/2up">prominent</a> merchant and trader in Schenectady.  

<p>After a time in the colonial militia, John H. Roseboom <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">served</a> the Patriot cause as a militia officer and as an active member of the Schenectady <a href="../../coc.html">Committee </a>of Correspondence.

<p>By <a href="http://historicalscribany.org/1790%20Census/Canaj-k-r.htm">1790</a>, he seems to have re-located to Canajoharie where he operated a store with other family members. In that year, he was made executor and left bequests in the will filed by his <a href="../../wills/willheroseboom1659.html">father</a> and, by his bachelor <a href="../../wills/willbaroseboom1590.html">brother</a>, five years later.

<p>Johannes H. Roseboom died at his home in Canajohrie in April 1805 and later was re-buried in the Prospect Hill <a href=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=Roseboom&GSiman=1&GScty=99952&GRid=43159706&"">Cemetery</a>. His widow survived until 1812. His <a href="elroseboom.html">daughter</a> married her father's business associate and later became an Albany resident.</p>
