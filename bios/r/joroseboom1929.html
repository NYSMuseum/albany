<strong>John H. Roseboom</strong></a> was born in January 1726. He was the son of <a href="heroseboom1656.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../c/elscuyler522.html">Elsje Cuyler</a> Roseboom. He was the first-born son in the small family that made its home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>His father died in 1754 and John H. became head of their <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household.  During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>,  "John H. and mother," "John and sister," and Elsje Roseboom were listed as the owners of second ward properties that were accorded substantial assessments. 

<p>One of a number of same-named individuals, this John H. Roseboom does not seem to have married and cannot be connected definitively to existing church information for "John Roseboom."

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1750">1750</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1756">1756</a> and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>, he was named firemaster for the second ward. In December 1770, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> and was recommended to be "inspector of flour."


<p>He inherited and held a number of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">properties</a> in Albany and its environs which later were <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc16906.htm">transferred</a> to his sister, Gerritje, and to her heirs. </p>

<p>For much of the second half of the eighteenth century, imprecise references warn us away from developing this profile further.
