<strong>Johannes G. Roseboom</strong></a> was born in March 1702. He was the son of <a href="geroseboom1609.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../s/masanders1434.html">Maria Sanders</a> Roseboom. He grew up in a merchant's home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In November 1739, he was thirty-seven years old when he married Elsie Lansing at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Although they were married until Elsie died in October 1751, their marriage appears to have been childless.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1738">1738</a>, he was named firemaster for the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1746">1746</a>, he was elected alderman. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1751">1751</a>, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html#treas">chamberlain</a> or treasurer of Albany. Because he held (elected annually) that position for more than thirteen years - until his death after 1765, we might make some judgments regarding his competency in this position of trust. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1756">1756</a>, he also was commissioned as recorder of the city and county.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#129">1756</a>, he was identified as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchant</a> and was said to live in "a good house." During the 1760s, his name appeared on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1762">petitions</a> submitted by groups of Albany merchants. He was a contractor of the city and owned additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real  estate</a> as well. In 1746, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willroroseboom.html">will</a> filed by his brother. In March 1761, he was among those witnessing the <a href="../../wills/willhecuyler530.html">will</a> of Hendrick Cuyler, Jr.


<p>Johannes G. Roseboom was alive in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a> but deceased by the time his brother filed a <a href="../../wills/willahroseboom1533.html">will</a> in December 1770.</p>
