<P><a href="#sources"><b>Robert Ray</b></a> was a Manhattan-based businessman who came to Albany during the War for Independence.</p> 

<p>The son of Richard and Eleanor Sanders Ray, he was born in 1713 and baptized in the New York City Dutch Reformed Church. His maternal great-grandfather and namesake was Albany entrepreneur <a href="../s/rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a>. At age fifty-five, Ray may have married (widow?) Belleta Dickenson in May 1763. The marriage produced no heirs and she was dead by 1784.</p>

      <p><a href="#sig"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigroray.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=4 vspace=0 width=130 height=35 alt="signature of Robert Ray - 1775"></a>A one-time Revolutionary committee member in New York, he probably left Manhattan following the British invasion in July 1776. In August of that year, he was in Albany and among those <a href="../../coc.html">appointed and paid</a> for inventorying the effects of a dead Continental officer.</p>

<p>In 1779, he was listed on the city assessment rolls as the owner of two pieces of Albany property. Perhaps they came from the <a href="../../wills/willrosanders1443.html">Sanders estate</a>!</p>

<p>After the war, he was granted a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> as a member of the city regiment of the Albany County militia. </p>

<p>Robert Ray filed a will in March 1784. It stated that he was a resident of Albany. No wife or children were named but it did mention his nephew Cornelius Ray and niece, <a href="cray6944.html">Cornelia Lansing</a> - who were designated as heirs and co-executors. The will passed probate in October 1788.</p>
