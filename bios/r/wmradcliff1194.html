<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>William Radcliff</strong></a> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on November 3, 1700. He was the son of <a href="joradcliff1060.html">John</a> and <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">Rachel Van Valkenburgh</a> Radcliff. He grew up in a large family of modest means on the southside of Albany.

<p>During his early adulthood, William <a href="http://threerivershms.com/radcliffe.htm">provided</a> a variety of to Albany organizations. These accounts illustrate some of those services and what he would receive: In December 1723, the church paid "Willem 6s for services provided the minister on his visits to the colony." On July 26, 1727, "Willem and Jacobus Redlief were paid £6 8s 1p  for stone and paving stone according to their bill." In September 1732, he was paid four shillings "for the woodwork."

<p>In February 1725, he married <a href="../b/mabennewe.html">Martha Bennewe</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1732, four children reflecting the names of the grandparents had been christened at the church where he witnessed a number of family related baptisms between 1729 and 1732. 

<p>The March 18, 1734 issue of the <i>New York Weekly Journal</i> <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ftIhNIvRp3IC&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=new+york+weekly+journal+1733&source=bl&ots=AantznlxRR&sig=VoYC60EywC5Tjs42BAh4fqLU6fw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEgQ6AEwCDgKahUKEwi2lI2LwtDHAhVCWD4KHRbjDxc#v=onepage&q=ratcliff&f=false">reported</a> that "[William Ratcliff] late of Albany -- died from fracture of skull." "Willem Redlif" was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/chburmen.html#272">buried</a> from the church in Albany on February 12.

<p>Albany native William Radcliff had lived almost thirty-four years. Later that year, his widow remarried and bore more children.</p>
