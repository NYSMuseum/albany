<P>Based on subsequent information, Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>John Randall</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">some</a>times <a href="../../res/sp.html">Randel</a>) was born about 1754. Several same-named individuals were active in the Northeast during his lifetime. Perhaps (but probably not), he was the "John Randall" born in Stonington, Connecticut <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&r=an&dbid=1034&iid=VBMDUSACT1634_0043-0331&fn=John&ln=Randall&st=r&ssrc=&pid=419354">in</a> March 1754. We seek definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Perhaps, he was the "John Randel" who <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=brianrandall&id=I1563">served</a> in the second regiment of the New York Line during the War for Independence. His son's biographer <a href="jorandalljr.html#holl">notes</a> another senario for this individual's wartime <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">experience</a>. 
        However, we must <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> more <a href="../../guide/histres.html#military">direct</a> 
        corroborating evidence.

<p>The Albany John Randall was married to the Albany brass-founder's kinswoman <a href="../f/cafairchild.html">Catherine Fairchild</a>. Family resources date their marriage to 1780. The marriage produced many (maybe even eleven) children. Beginning in 1786, a number of them were christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. In those records, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/metal.html">brass</a> founder and/or brazier. He also has been <a href="jorandalljr.html#holl">called</a> a jeweller. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#joran">1788</a>, he probably 
        was a boarder in the third ward (rooming) house of <a href="../h/pahog8494.html">Paul 
        Hogstrasser</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#joran">1790</a>, and 
        for the <a href="../../census1800.html#jora">next</a> two censuses, the 
        households of "John Randall" of eleven and then nine people were configured 
        on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. His residence was on the river level road called <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. 

<p>From its earliest days, John Randall was a member and officer of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. As late as 1823, he was elected vice-president of the organization.

<p>Beginning in 1815, city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> identified him as a brass founder who was living at 107 North Market Street. During John Sr's. lifetime, his famous <a href="jorandalljr.html">son</a> maintained a residence at 168 North Market. <a href="jorandalljr.html">John Randall, 
        Jr.</a>, produced (among many others) a <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc19811.htm">map</a> 
        of Philip Schuyler's Albany property at the request of Schuyler's heirs 
        during 1808-09. In 1813, John Jr. commissioned <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra 
        Ames</a> to <a href="../../books.html#eaa">paint</a> his father's portrait. 
      <p>John Randall (the elder) died in October 1823 at the age of sixty-nine. 
        His widow lived another thirteen years. </p>
