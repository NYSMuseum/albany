<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Pieter Ryckman</strong></a> probably was born during the 1730s. He possibly was the son of Wilhelmus and Anna Wyngaert Ryckman of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. However, he seems to have spent his early adulthood in Albany and on the frontier where he was known as a merchant and trader.

<p>In November 1758, he married Albany native <a href="../vd/lyvdb5815.html">Lydia Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, he was identified as an Albany <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchant</a>. By 1769, six children had been christened at the Albany church where both parents were long-time members and pewholders.

<p>In 1764, he joined with other Albany merchants in a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html">petition</a> to the British regarding the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. Throughout the 1760s, he was known as a "Canada trader" who frequently traded to Niagara. At the same time, his Albany family continued to grow in their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home. 

<p>In 1763, he was appointed firemaster for the first ward. In 1765, he was appointed to fill a vacancy on the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a>. In 1768, he was elected assistant alderman.

<p>With the onset of hostilities, he was elected to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> and served until it was superceded by the resurrected municipal government in 1778. Maintaining his contacts with Native peoples in the west, he served Governor Clinton as a messenger and interpreter.

<p>With the end of the war, Ryckman continued in government service but also acquired extensive acreage in the western regions of New York State. With his <a href="wiryckman1996.html">son</a> and protege, he seems to have spent considerable time in the Finger Lakes region where the Cayugas thought of him as an adoptive son. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="There's much more to this story!"></a>

<p>He also retained his <a href="../../census1790.html#1985">Albany home</a> - although it was chiefly inhabited by his wife and sisters. In time, they were joined by Wilhelmus while their father stayed in the West. 

 <p>Pieter Ryckman died in January 1811 and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Dutch church cemetery plot. He had lived more than seventy-nine years. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in November 1813. His widow maintained an Albany home and lived on into the 1830s.
