<p><a href="#sources"> <strong>Edward Reims</strong></a> was a one-time <a href="../../garrison.html">soldier</a> in the garrison company under the command of Captain <a href="../w/jaweems.html">W</a>eems on duty at the Albany fort. Afterwards, he sought to <a href="../../criteria.html">live</a> in Albany and to participate in "trade" (<a href="../../econ/comec.html">business</a>). That ambition was cut short by his death in September 1702.
  
	  
<P>In June 1699, he was among those <a href="../../doc/cc/0627699.html">charged</a> by the Albany government for trading without being qualified as a freeman. In September 1701, he still had not qualified and was ordered to stop trading until he had secured a license to retail liquors.
 
<p>Edward Reims filed a <a href="../../wills/willedreims.html">will</a> in September 1702. He called himself a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victualler">victualler</a> of Albany. It named his wife Elizabeth as the heir of his personal estate. Soldiers and officers were also named in the document. The will passed probate twelve days later.

<p>Except for the references noted above, his <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> has not been found in the community-based record considered so far. Thus, his story awaits answers to major <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.</p>
