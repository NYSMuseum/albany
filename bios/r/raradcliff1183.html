<strong>Rachel Radcliff</strong></a> was born in February 1729. She was the daughter of <a href="jaradcliff1049.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../b/cabovie7384.html">Catharina Bovie</a> Radcliff. She grew up in a large family in the first ward home of a cartman and Dutch church retainer.

<p>By the end of the 1740s, she had married <a href="../w/thwill6920.html">Thomas Willis</a>. Between 1749 and 1769, nine <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA184-IA3&lpg=PA184-IA3&dq=%22rachel+radcliff%22+albany&source=bl&ots=-YxaC-HT8r&sig=7lvbhmJD0XJ2MuAhgUKycSxRgWI&hl=en&ei=pB18S8GJHIzZ8AaPqJS8BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#">children</a> had been christened in <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>.
<p><a href="../../res/sp.html">Willis</a> was a <a href="../../census1756.html#323">weaver</a> and the couple raised their family in a modest house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first</a> and also third wards where they were <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6920">mainstays</a> for much of the remainder of the century. 

<p>However, Rachel was a widow by <a href="../../census1790.html#1183">1790</a>, when her large first ward household was configured on the census. By <a href="../../poor.html#1183">1799</a>, her name was on a list of those "permanent poor" who were to receive payments from the city. Those bequests continued well into 1802.
<p>In January 1792, she witnessed an all-Radley family <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part8.html">christening</a>.
<p>Rachel Radcliff Willis probably died during the early 1800s.
