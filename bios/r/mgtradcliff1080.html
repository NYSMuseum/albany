<P><a href="#sources"><b>Margarita Radcliff</b></a> was born in 1706. She was the youngest daughter in the large family of former soldier <a href="joradcliff1060.html">John Radcliff</a> and his wife, <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">Rachel Van Valkenburgh</a> Radcliff.</p>

<p>Margarita lost her father at an early age. Rachel Radcliff never re-married and the girl grew up in a crowded <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home - helping out with her mother's numerous paying jobs.</p>


<p>In 1732, she married carpenter <a href="../vv/javvlk1306.html">Jacobus Van Valkenburgh</a>. By 1748, eight children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a <a href="#baptism">frequent</a> baptism sponsor. These Van Valkenburghs lived on Albany's Southside surrounded by kin and other working class families.</p>

<p>In 1766, she was named executor and heir in her husband's <a href="../../wills/willjavvlk.html">will</a>. He was dead in 1778 when she wrote <a href="../../wills/willmgtradcliff1080.html">her own will</a> - leaving her estate to her numerous children and grandchildren. She then moved in with one of her <a href="../../marriages.html#daughters">daughters</a>. Margarita Radcliff Van Valkenburgh died in September 1791. She had lived in Albany for most of the eighteenth century!</p>
