<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Margarita Ryckman</strong></a> is said to have been born in October 1681. She was the daughter of <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert Janse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Cornelia Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. She grew up an older child of a very large family in the riverside <a href="../../im/im1686.html">home</a> of Albany's most prominent brewer.

<p>In April 1696, she became a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In October 1705, the church sanctioned her marriage to  Samuel Kip of "Kipsberry" (family farm on Manhattan) at her father's Albany house. No children seem to have been christened in her Albany church.

<p>These Kips appear to have made their home <a href="../../na/na.html">beyond</a> the Albany magnet. Perhaps he was the Samuel Kip elected to the New York City Council during the 1730s. 

<p>In September 1736, Margarita was identified as a living daughter and heir in the <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">will</a> filed by her father.
<p>Margarita Ryckman Kip is said to have died in October 1740. Her husband passed away either a month <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=delamontagne&id=I00967">or</a> eight years later</p>
