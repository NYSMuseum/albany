<P> Spelled and referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <strong>Lambert 
        Radcliff</strong> was born in September 1691. He was a son in the large 
        family of <a href="joradcliff1060.html">John</a> and <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">Rachel 
        Van Valkenburgh</a> Radcliff. His twin sister soon died as another <a href="mgtradcliff1080.html">Margarita 
        Radcliff</a> was christened in 1706. Lambert survived and grew up in the 
        modest home of a former soldier located in a culturally diverse enclave 
        on Albany's <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a>. His 
        unique name honored the maternal <a href="../vv/lavvlk1363.html">grandfather</a>.</p>
      <p>He was thirty-two-years-old in January 1724 when he married Albany neighbor 
        <a href="../vz/anvzandt238.html">Anna Van Zandt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. By 1735, six children had been christened at the church where 
        he was a frequent baptism sponsor. 
      <p>Like both of their families, these Radcliffs also lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> where Lambert's name was included on <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1077">lists</a> 
        of qualified voters as late as <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1077">1763</a>. 
        In <a href="../../census1756.html#217">1756</a>, he was counted among 
        Albany's householders. He served as constable and firemaster for the first 
        ward and was a paid contractor of the city. He may have operated a brickyard 
        near or on what became <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>.	
      <p>Lambert Radcliff was last heard from in 1767 when his first ward home 
        was assessed at one pound.</p>
