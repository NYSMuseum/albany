<strong>Elizabeth Radcliff</strong></a> was born in November 1763. She was the daughter of <a href="joradcliff1067.html">John L.</a> and <a href="../w/elwilk6889.html">Elizabeth Wilkinson</a> <a href="../../res/sp.html">Rad</a>cliff. She grew up a member of a medium-sized family in a cordwainer's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>Probably during the late 1780s, she married one <a href="../n/sanorton.html">Samuel Norton</a>. Perhaps he was one of the sons and the namesake of a founder of Saratoga (who died in 1783) and was listed there as a head of family there on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census of 1790</a>. However, beginning in 1792, their four Norton children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Although we are uncertain as to the timing, by 1799 these Nortons were living with or next to her father at 48 Hudson Street. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">At that time</a>, Norton was listed as the owner of the personal property and the elder Radley in a subordinated position . However, the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#1067">1800</a> laid out two households (Radley and Norton) next to eachother in the first ward. Her father, John L. Radley, died in 1809.

<p>By the time of the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in 1813, Samuel and Elizabeth Norton were themselves Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA81&dq=%22norton%22">mainstays</a>.  As she aged through her fifties, sixties, and beyond her identity seems to have been entirely within the Norton household as they finally moved to a home at what became 218 South Pearl Street. 

<p>Elizabeth Radcliff Norton died in April 1841 at the age of seventy-seven. She was buried in the Dutch church cemetery plot. Her husband then removed to Lyme, Connecticut where he died in October 1842.</p>
