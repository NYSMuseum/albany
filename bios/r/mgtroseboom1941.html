<strong>Margarita Roseboom</strong></a> was born in April 1706. She was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="joroseboom1671.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../c/gecoster.html">Gerritje Coster</a> Roseboom. Both sides of her family represented early Albany's trading and business communities.  


<p>In April 1728, she married <a href="../b/nibleecker220.html">Nicholas Bleecker, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1728, seven children were christened in the Albany church where she was a member, pewholder, and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Bleeckers lived in Albany's second ward from where Nicholas found success following the Bleeckers and Rosebooms in the Indian <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a>.

<p>In November 1737, she was named along with her mother and five siblings in the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>Margarita Roseboom Bleecker was only forty-four when she lost her husband in 1751. She probably was one of the "Widow Blyker"s who were <a href="../../census1756.html#128">listed</a> on the <a href="../../census1756.html#4">census</a> of Albany householders taken in 1756. She lived on for several decades as the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1941">head</a> of her <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home. Perhaps she later lived with her son, <a href="../b/jnbleecker204.html">John N. Bleecker</a>.

<p>Widow Margarita died in August 1794, a few months past her eighty-eighth birthday.</p>
