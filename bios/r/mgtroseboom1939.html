<strong>Margarita Roseboom</strong></a> was born during the 1660s. She was the daughter of <a href="heroseboom1622.html">Hendrick Janse</a> and his first wife, <a href="../l/gylansing3332.html">Gysbertie Lansing</a> Roseboom. Her parents were Albany mainstays and Margarita grew up in their landmark home located on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> at "Roseboom's gate."

<P>By 1683, she had joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In November 1685, she married <a href="../m/pimingael6195.html">Pieter Thomase Mingael</a>. The marriage appears to have been childless as no children were christened in Albany. They were, however, Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#151">residents</a> who lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. She was an occasional baptism sponsor.


<p>Margarita Roseboom Mingael lost her husband in 1706. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1939">1709</a>, she was identified as the head of her second ward household. She died sometime thereafter.</p>
