<P>Known as <a href="#sources">
<strong>John L. Radley</strong></a>, this lifelong Albany resident was born in November 1730. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="laradcliff1077.html">Lambert</a> and <a href="../vz/anvzandt238.html">Anna Van Zandt</a> Radcliff. His parents both were children of <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> who married daughters of Albany's <a href="../../nnd.html">founders</a>.

<p>In December 1759, he married a somewhat younger <a href="../w/elwilk6889.html">Elizabeth Wilkinson</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At the time of the marriage, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cordwainer</a> and she as a spinster. By 1767, the marriage had produced four or five children who were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a>, John was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. These Radcliff/Radleys set up their home near both their families in a building - parts of which still <a href="http://www.albanyweblog.com/2007/08-Aug/08-04-07_Ref_02.html">survive</a> at number 48 Hudson Avenue. Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his holdings were valued modestly on city assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1067">rolls</a>. His property on the south side of Hudson is shown on a <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">map</a> of the street made in 1800.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1067">1790</a>  and  <a href="../../census1800.html#1067">1800</a>, his small family was shown on the censuses next door to his son-in-law and business partner <a href="../n/sanorton.html">Samuel Norton</a>. During those years, their store or shop was valued separately.

<p>During the 1760s, "John Lambert Radcliff" was an officer in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. At the outbreak of the war in 1775, he contributed for the relief of Ticonderoga. In 1778, he was among those older residents <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#1067">exempted</a> from military service. He does not appear to have been granted a land bounty right for service.

<p>During the 1780s, his account was paid from the city treasury. In 1788, he still owed more than eight pounds to the <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#1067">estate</a> of the late Dr. Henry Van Dyck.

<p>John L. Radley died in July 1809 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
