      <P>The <a href="#sources"> <strong>Radcliff - Radley</strong></a> family 
        of early Albany is descended from <a href="joradcliff1060.html">John Radcliffe</a> 
        who was a soldier at the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> 
        and who married the <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">daughter</a> of the 
        Albany watchman about 1680. By the time of his passing during the early 
        1700s, his large family was ready to establish the name (however <a href="../../res/sp.html">variably</a> 
        spelled) in Albany and its hinterland. 
      <p>In 1742, <a href="laradcliff1077.html">Lambert</a>, <a href="joradcliff1061.html">Johannes</a>, 
        and <a href="jaradcliff1049.html">Jacobus</a> "Rallif" were identified 
        in a list of Albany freeholders in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>With one or more named households on community <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">survey</a> 
        documents, particularly after 1760, the Radcliffs maintained a consistent 
        but modest <a href="../../census1756.html#217">pres</a>e<a href="../../census1756.html#191">nce</a> 
        in the eighteenth century city. The men mostly pursued service activities 
        in the <a href="../../econ/comec.html#sec">economy</a> and in community 
        service while Radcliff women married into Albany families of modest means. 
        Marriage partners often were found among the Radcliffs' first ward neighbors. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the Albany census listed 
        five Radcliff/Radley-named households residing in the first ward and another 
        in three families in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA84,M1">1813</a>, 
        six Radcliff households were listed in the first Albany directory. In 
        1830, the Radlcliff name still defined six Albany addresses. 
      <p>During the nineteenth century, the Radcliff/Radley family spread out 
        into eastern and northern New York State. Long-lived <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">Rachel 
        Van Valkenburgh</a>, the first Radcliffe wife and its matriarch, is perhaps 
        the family's most notable personage.</p>

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> 
        is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Chief among 
        the genealogical materials is a series of articles on the family by William 
        Laimbeer. Entitled "The Radcliffe Family of New York State," and published 
        in the <a href="../../sources.html#nygbr"><i>NYGBR</i></a>, they appeared 
        in four installments in volumes 80-81 (1949-50). Our work on the Radcliffs 
        has benefitted from a <a href="../../famrecon.html">family reconstitution</a> 
        completed by intern Glenn Griffith in 1988. We also acknowledge with thanks 
        the comprehensive, family-based material compiled and provided by the 
        late family genealogist <a href="http://boards.ancestry.myfamily.com/surnames.wands/50/mb.ashx">Larry 
        House</a>. We are thankful that he was able to put his extensive work 
        and notes on the family <a href="http://threerivershms.com/radcliffe.htm">online</a>. 
        Whenever I go to that resource (he left us so much), I remember Larry 
        fondly and am grateful for his diligence, dedication, and ever-questioning 
        need-to-know.
