<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Jacob Roseboom</strong></a> was born in July 1695. He was the first child born to the marriage of <a href="heroseboom1655.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../s/destaats4565.html">Debora Staats</a> Roseboom. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of an Albany mainstay. 

<p>He grew up in a merchant's home on Pearl Street where he probably got to know minister's daughter  <a href="../l/geerlydius4616.html">Geertruy Isabella Lydius</a> - who lived nearby.  They were married in August 1716 - five months before the birth of their first child. By 1726, the marriage had produced at least four children who were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, pewholder, and baptism sponsor.

<p>These Rosebooms lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Jacob was registered as a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1665">1720</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1665">1742</a>, and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1665">1763</a>. He was called "<a href="../../trades/medical.html">Doctor</a>" and identified on the census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html#95">1756</a> as an apothecary.

<p>His "medicine" centered on herbal remedies. He was called a "medicaster" and his practice was <a href="../../art/ham.html#med2">described</a> with disdain by the traveller Dr. Alexander Hamilton in 1744. Hamilton also noted that Roseboom's medical library included only one weighty tome.

 
<p>Jacob Roseboom lost his wife in 1757. His Albany home was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> during the mid-1760s. He died after 1767.
