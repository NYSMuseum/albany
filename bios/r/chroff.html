<P><a href="#sources"><b>Christina</b></a> was the wife then widow of skipper and merchant <a href="joroff1026.html">John Roff</a>. She was in Albany by November 1763 when, with her husband, she witnessed a baptism at the Albany Dutch church. A prominent member of Albany's German enclave, she was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran Church</a>.</p>


<p>Her names have been found in the <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a> in <a href="../../res/sp.html">variable forms</a>. She was the mother of several children and seemed to act as head of her household  perhaps instead of her husband the sailor. In 1789, she rented property on the hill from the Lutheran Church. </p>



<p>John Roff died in October 1800. Christina was identified as the head of her <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> household on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#2115">1800</a>. The widow Roff's home at the city line on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> was an early Albany landmark. It was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA84,M1">located</a> at 1 Market Street (corner of Patroon) where she ran a grocery. After 1814, the grocery was operated by her son, John.</p>

<p>Christina Roff died after 1814. Her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in February 1821.</p>
