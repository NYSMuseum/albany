<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelia Ray</b></a> was born about 1758. She was a daughter of the Ray family of New York City. She was the <a href="#niece">niece</a> of Manhattan businessman <a href="roray6947.html">Robert Ray</a> who fled to Albany during the War for Independence.</p>


<p>In April 1781, she married attorney and Revolutionary officer 
<a href="../l/jolansing3755.html">John Lansing, Jr.</a> at the Albany 
<a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1800, their ten children had been baptized there.</p>

      <p>After the war, their large, new home was a <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market 
        Street</a> landmark as Lansing rose through the political ranks to become 
        mayor of Albany in 1786. With a large and growing family and with her 
        husband in often away on business, Cornelia's household was attended by 
        several household servants.</p>

<p>Her long marriage ended when Chancellor Lansing disappeared in 1829. The following year, letters of administration were issued on his estate. "Widow" Cornelia Ray Lansing died on January 24, 1834. She had lived seventy-six years. </p>
