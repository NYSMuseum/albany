<strong>Stephen Richard</strong></a> was born in July 1732. He was the son of John Richard and his wife <a href="../vr/elvr5067.html">Elizabeth Van Rensselaer</a> Richard. He may have been an only child and grew up in New York and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.


<p>By 1765, he had married Albany native <a href="../t/mgttbroeck62.html">Margarita Ten Broeck</a>. Both partners were in their mid-thirties at the time of their wedding. The marriage appears to have been childless.

<p>He owned a house and lot in Albany and other <a href="../../res/realestate.html">properties</a> as well. In 1766, his mother appears to have been living with him. Perhaps he also lived in New York where he owned several houses.

<p>He filed a <a href="../../wills/willstrich916.html">will</a> in March 1773. It named his wife, mother, and other kin as his heirs. Stephen Richard died in May of that year and was buried by his mother in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. His widow re-married five years later.</p>
