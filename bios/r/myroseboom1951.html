<P><a href="#sources"><b>Myndert Roseboom</b></a> (or Myndert H.Roseboom) was born in May 1735. He was the son of Albany businessman <a href="heroseboom1659.html">Hendrick M.</a> and <a href="../t/mate4899.html">Maria Ten Eyck</a> Roseboom.</p>


<p>He was past his thirtieth birthday when he married skipper's daughter <a href="../s/geswitts5659.html">Geertruy Switts</a> in July 1765. The marriage may have only produced one daughter who was baptized in 1766 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Myndert was a member, pewholder, and occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Myndert Roseboom was a prominent <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#1951">merchant</a> and a resident of Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In 1766, he joined a group of Albany men in signing the <a href="../../solconst.html#1951">constitution</a> of the Sons of Liberty. In 1771, he was elected assistant alderman for the first ward.</p>

<p>Previously, he had been an officer in the provincial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In <a href="../../sources.html#jp">1759</a>, he was identified as a Major with the New York provincial regiment at the seige of Fort Niagara. In August 1775, he was nominated to be colonel of the second regiment of the  <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">New York Line</a>. He seems to have declined the commission "due to his age."  

<p> In 1776 and 1777, he was elected and served as a member of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> for the first ward.</p>

<p>Later, he served as a commissioner of sequestration for the middle district of New York and was awarded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany county militia.</p>


<p>Myndert Roseboom's personal property was valued on the Albany assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1951">1788</a>. In May 1790, he was left a monetary bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willheroseboom1659.html">will</a> filed by his father. His household was not configured on the Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#hr">census</a> although he may have been accounted for under the household of Hendrick Roseboom.</p>
