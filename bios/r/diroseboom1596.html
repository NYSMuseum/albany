<strong>Dirck Roseboom</strong></a> was born between 1727 and 1732. He was the son of <a href="ahroseboom1533.html">Ahasuerus</a> and <a href="../b/mabradt4357.html">Maria Bradt</a> Roseboom. Unlike their other children, his baptism was not recorded in the records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He grew up in a merchant's home located in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>His name first appeared in Albany records when he was summoned to appear in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">court</a> in April 1749. He was appointed constable for the third ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1753">1753</a> and firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1762">1762</a>. In 1764, his name was included on a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#1596">petition</a> signed by Albany merchants regarding the Indian trade.

<p>In 1766, he stood with other Albany men in signing a <a href="../../solconst.html#1596">document</a> protesting the Stamp Act. During that period, he seems to have lived with his father. His support of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> seems to have been financial although he was an Albany mainstay during the war years. In <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">1778</a>, he was among those older Albany men exempted from active duty. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 


<p>In May 1770, he was identified as the son and named the principal beneficiary of the <a href="../../wills/willahroseboom1533.html">estate</a> of his father. When the will was probated in 1774, Dirck received his father's dwelling, a share of another building in Albany, and also personal property and slaves.

<P>Because we can find no children born during the 1750s and 60s, perhaps this Dirck Roseboom did not marry. The wife of a Dirck Roseboom named Rhoda had a child baptized at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> in 1788. However, this Dirck would have been about sixty-years-old at that time. He was a member and pewholder at the Albany Dutch church.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, Dirck "A." Roseboom was identified as the head of a Roseboom houshold on Albany rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1596">1788</a>, his home was valued on the city assessment roll. Two years later, the <a href="../../census1790.html#1596">census</a> counted three people in his third ward household. 


<p>Dirck Roseboom was buried from the church in May 1796.</p>
