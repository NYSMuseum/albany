<strong>Henry Radcliff/Radley</strong></a> was born in November 1763. He was the second of five sons born to the marriage of Johannes and Margarita Passage <a href="../../res/sp.html">R</a>adcliff. By the time he reached adulthood, contemporary kin were being called "Radley."

<p>In May 1784, he married <a href="../j/eljacobs.html">Elizabeth Jacobs</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  Their daughter was born the following March.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1046">1788</a>, his modest <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home was configured on the first ward assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1046">1790</a>, his household totalled six members. By <a href="../../census1800.html#1046">1800</a>, an older woman had joined his family. 

<p>Beginning during the 1780s, his accounts were paid by the city treasurer. On some of those occasions, he was identified as the watchman. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA160&lpg">1787</a>, Albany's watchmen agreed to accept pay of three shillings a night.  In 1791 and 1796, he was identified as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fireman</a> in the first ward. In February 1826, a Henry Radcliff was appointed inspector of weights and measures. That was the latest reference to him. 

<p>Annual <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a>, which date from <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&q=radcliff#PPA84,M1">1813</a>, showed his address at a number of first ward locations on Union, <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson</a>, Liberty, and Green Streets over the next decade. It appears that he shared the Union Street address with his older <a href="jaradcliff1050.html">brother</a>.

<p>Henry Radley died sometime after 1826.
