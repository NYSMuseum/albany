<P>Spelled and referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, a Captain then Major <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Rutherford</strong></a> served in New York during the mid-eighteenth century. A printed compilation from British army rolls <a href="https://archive.org/stream/britishofficerss00ford#page/n177/mode/2up">identified</a> him as a captain in the <a href="#forces">New York</a> forces who was commissioned on December 31, 1741. <a href="../qqqq.html#one">A</a> John Rutherford was commissioned a major in the 62nd Regiment (under the Earl of Loudoun) in January 1756. 

      <p>While a prominent operative in the Albany area from the 1740s until his death 
        in 1758, we have yet to fix this officer's residence <a href="../../criteria.html">and/or</a> 
        ascertain his specific connection to the city of Albany. However, he was 
        <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/papersofsirwilli14johnuoft#page/500/mode/2up">associated/connected</a> 
        with/to regional magnate <a a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> 
        whose published <a href="../../sources.html#jp">papers</a> associate Rutherford 
        with a number of Albany notables including mayor <a href="../h/edholland.html">Ed</a>ward 
        Holland and <a href="../l/jhlydius4615.html">Jo</a>hn Henry Lydius. A 
        member of the governor's Council since the 1740s, he also was present 
        at Indian <a href="../../cia.html">conferences</a> held in Albany. 
      <p>Family-based <a href="http://www.clanrutherfurd.org/Genealogy.aspx">resources</a> tell us that he was born in April 1712 and was the eldest son of Sir John Rutherfurd - Lord Edgerston and his wife Elizabeth Cairncross. Thus, he represented Selkirkshire in 1730 and Roxburghshire (Teviotdale) 1734-41 in Parliament. Perhaps he married <a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Elliot-1608">Eleanora Elliot</a> in Edinburgh, Scotland in November 1737. That marriage produced at least three children. Perhaps it was daughter <a href="jarutherford.html">Janet</a> who became an Albany resident.


<p>He is said to have <a href="http://www.britishbattles.com/french-indian-war/general-braddocks-defeat-on-the-monongahela-in-1755-viii/">served</a> as captain of a "New York Independent Company" under Edward Braddock in western Pennsylvania in June 1755.

<p>John Rutherford is <a href="#killed">said</a> to have been killed at Ticonderoga in July 1758.

<p>Unlike many of those of his station, he does not seem to have <a href="../../sources.html#clp">patented land</a> in the province of New York.

<p>At this point, our comprehension of this John Rutherford's life beyond the military is sketchy at best. Please indulge our <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">intention</a> to learn more about him.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based resources</a>.

<p><a name=killed>
        Fellow officer <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/rutherford/5455/">Walter</a> 
        Rutherfurd (1723-1804) <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/RUTHERFORD/2000-03/0954554603">appears</a> 
        to have been John's younger brother and to have served at Ticonderoga 
        as well. Walter Rutherford was a trader in the firm of "Rutherford & Duncan," 
        recruited potential settlers, and later was the proprietor of an estate 
        in New Jersey. Perhaps he married the daughter of James Alexander. 
        <p>Overall, this feeble offering represents a first attempt to connect him to 
          the world of the <a href="../../criteria.html">people</a> of colonial 
          Albany - a place where he he did indeed spend time! Old friend and fellow 
          early New York enthusiast <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+waldron+albany&gws_rd=ssl#hl=en&q=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+albany+burke">Tom 
          Burke</a> first pointed me to consider this individual. Upon reflection, 
          his story bring up questions of who attended the so-called "Indian" 
          <a href="../../furtrade.html">conferences</a> in Albany and what was 
          the British army doing in the colony in peace time. More pointedly, 
          we have not yet comprehended the nature and extent of the royal presence 
          at places like the Albany <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>. 
 
        <p><a name=forces></a>The most often encountered <a href="https://archive.org/details/britishofficerss00ford">overview source</a> for "British officers serving in America" <a href="https://archive.org/stream/britishofficerss00ford#page/n4/mode/2up">likens</a> the designation "New York" to the Four <a href="../../garrison.html">Independent Companies</a> of New York - two of which sometimes were stationed at Albany.
