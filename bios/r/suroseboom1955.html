<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Susanna Roseboom</strong></a> was born in June 1733. She was the daughter of <a href="heroseboom1658.html">Hendrick</a> and 
<a href="../s/caschuyler1245.html">Cathalina Schuyler</a> Roseboom. She was one of their six children christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1729 and 1745.
 
<p>However, her father died in 1746 leaving Susanna's mother to carry on in their Albany home until her bachelor <a href="heroseboom1663.html">brother</a> came of age about 1760. In 1769, she was identified in the <a href="../../wills/willheroseboom1663.html">will</a> filed by Hendrick H. Roseboom.

<p>In April 1755, she had married Isaac I. <a href="../t/truax.html">Truax</a> at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. By 1773,eight children had been christened in Schenectady. As early as 1757, Susanna was identifed as a pewholder in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">D</a>utch church. 

<p>Susanna's Truax family may have made its home in Albany (perhaps in Roseboom's house) although her husband, "Isaac I." Truax, probably would not survive much beyond the start of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1955">1779</a>, the widow Truax and her son were assessed on the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> tax list. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1955">1788</a> "Susanna Truax:" was identified as the owner of the third ward home with the personal property of her sons, <a href="../t/isitruax1959.html">Isaac I. Truax</a> (1759-1812) and  <a href="../t/hetruax.html">Henry</a> (1761-1834) valued under her roof.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#ht">1790</a>, recently married Henry Truax was listed on the census as the head of that household with his mother accounted for along with his new wife. By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, Susanna had left for her own house on Pearl Street where the second ward assessment roll accounted for her personal property as well. The census in <a href="../../census1800.html#1955">1800</a> showed her alone in the house although it was served by four slaves. In 1811, Susanna freed her two female slaves. In April 1798, she had <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc18047.htm">deeded</a> an Albany lot to her son Isaac.

<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, her household had dropped from the Albany census. Perhaps she had moved in with her youngest son, Cornelis.

<p>Susanna Roseboom Truax died in July 1813 and appears to have been <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/cemeteries/luckhurst.html">buried</a> in Schenectady. She had lived eighty years.</p>
