          <P><A href="#biography"><B>John Radcliff</B></A> <a href="#parents">probably</a> 
            was born in England during the mid-seventeenth century. He probably 
            came to America as a young soldier. By the 1680s, he was a member 
            of the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> on duty at the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> at Albany.</P>

<P>About that time, he married <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">Rachel Van Valkenburgh</a>, 
            daughter of the Albany night watchman. Leaving the barracks, he moved 
            in with her parents on Albany's "<a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>." By 1706, the couple had 
            baptized eleven children in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> where both parents were members. In 1699, John Radcliff 
            was among the "Principal Members of the Church" who signed a petition 
            to the "Classis of Amsterdam."</P>

          <p>John Radcliff may have been a career garrison soldier. During the 1680s and 
            90s, his name appeared on muster rolls and pay lists as a soldier 
            and a corporal in the Albany garrison company. <a href="#sig"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/joradcliffsig.jpg" align=right hspace=4 vspace=4 border=0 width=275 alt="signature of John Radcliffe"></a> 
            However, existing records are incomplete and probably provide only 
            a part of his military service.</p>

<p>In 1697, he was appointed city porter - giving him the right to make deliveries within the Albany stockade. Later he served as watchman, gatekeeper, and cryer - salaried service positions often reserved for former soldiers. He derived additional income from maintaining the blockhouse and for digging graves. John Radcliff was an early Albany city retainer.</p>

<p>For a time, Radcliff leased space in the Dutch church poorhouse. In 1704, John and Rachel Radcliff purchased land from her family near their home at the intersection of <a href="../../streets.html#green">Green</a> and <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver</a> Streets. Living among other active and former garrison soldiers, his modest <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> holdings were listed on Albany assessment rolls.</p>
  
<p>John Radcliff's name disappeared from the community record following his appearance at an Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> meeting in November 1709. He probably died before 1720. By 1727, Rachel Radcliff was identified as a widow! One of early Albany's premier "<a href="../../garrison.html#resident">soldier families</a>," the descendants of John and Rachel also established the Radcliff and Radley name throughout the region.</p>
