<P>Known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent Ridder</strong></a> probably was born in the 1750s or 60s. He probably was not <a href="../qqqq.html#one">the</a> "Barent Ridder" who was <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XBTZ-3Z6">christened</a> on July 23, 1752 in Amsterdam, Holland? He does not appear to have been closely connected the "<a href="../d/evdridder7830.html">De Ridder</a>" family of early Albany. We have not yet ruled out <a href="../../res/sp.html">Rider/Ryder</a> family origins. Sources that follow may place his birth at prior to the mid-1760s. In any event, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>In July 1784, <a href="../qqqq.html#one">a</a> Barent Ridder  was in Albany when he married one "Nency Ryn" at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. No subsequent christenings have been encountered thus far in the records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, <a href="../../census.html">census</a> returns point to children in his household.

<p>In January <a href="#1785">1785</a>, the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> authorized payment of eleven pounds to one "Barent Fryder."  

<p>The city assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7832">1788</a> valued the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house and property of "Barent Rider" modestly. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7832">1790</a>, the household of "Barent Rider" was configured on the census of the second ward. Nine years later in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and personal property on Orange Street were valued modestly on the second ward assessment. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7832">1800</a>, his household was configured in the first ward. At that time it consisted of a man and woman aged 26-45, two young boys, a young girl, and two "other" <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free persons</a>. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, the couple still was in the 26-45 age bracket, but also enumerated were four boys under 16, and three young girls. No other individuals were accounted for in his household.

<p>In January 1797, an Albany newspaper <a href="../../doc/nn2.html#1797">reported</a> that the city council awarded "Barent De Rider, a carman," twenty shillings or $2.50 for being the first to arrive at the previous evening's <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> (probably not the more noteworthy <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">fire</a> in August of that year) with a hogshead of water.

<p>After 1810, the name of Barent Ridder has not been found in the community-based records examined. Past diminishing returns, and still missing defining demographic information, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of this early Albany resident.</p>
