<strong>Abraham Roseboom</strong></a> was born in January 1715. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany trader <a href="heroseboom1655.html">Hendrick</a> and surgeon's daughter <a href="../s/destaats4565.html">Debora Staats</a> Roseboom. He grew up in a comfortable home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> near the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">N</a>orth gate of the stockade.

<p>He does not appear to have married but was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>He was a mainline businessman, <a href="../../wills/williskip.html#wit">shopkeeper</a>, and contractor of the city. His substantial house was configured on the census of <a href="../../census1756.html#16">1756</a>. Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> valued his <a href="../../wards.html#2">property</a> as of more than moderate value. He also owned a lot in the first ward. Although he seems to have been directly involved in community business, he held no public offices. In <a  href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1532">1763</a>, he was identified as an Albany freeholder.


<p>Abraham Roseboom died in April 1785. A newspaper obituary called him a "very respectable citizen." At that time, he was seventy years old.</p>
