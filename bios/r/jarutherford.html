<P><a href="#sources">Jane/Janet Rutherford</a> was the wife of newcomer Albany shoemaker <a href="../../bios/e/joeaston7912.html">John Easton</a>. Perhaps she was the <a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Rutherford-2104">daughter</a> of Captain <a href="jorutherford.html">John Rutherford</a> - a royal operative in the Albany area during the 1740s and 50s. In any event, we seek defining information on her precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.</p>

<p>By January 1779, these Eastons had settled in Albany when her son James was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Several more children followed. In 1788, her son John was christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>.</p>

<P>Her growing family <a href="../../census1790.html#7912">lived</a> on <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">upper State Street</a> until John Easton's death in 1799. For a time afterwards, widow Janet resided in the house subsequently headed by her son. In 1802, she purchased   the lot behind their house extending south to <a href="../../streets.html#nail">Nail Street</a>. However, by 1814, she had relocated to 97 <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver Street</a>.</p>

<p>Janet Rutherford Easton was dead by August 16, 1816 when her will passed probate!</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Janet Rutherford Easton is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 7915.

Probably of Scottish origins, we seek defining information on her family and on the circumstances of her arrival in Albany!</font size></p>
