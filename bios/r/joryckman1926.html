<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Johannes Ryckman</strong></a>  was born in January 1673. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Cornelia Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. He grew up in a large family at his father's brewery and was a young adult when he was counted in Albert Janse's household on the Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#048">census</a> taken in June 1697. 

<p>A month later, he married New Yorker Catharina Kip at the New York Dutch church. Johannes was a member of the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany church</a>, and, after his marriage, of the Reformed church in New York City. The marriage produced seven children who were christened in New York.<p>

<p>This Ryckman family lived on Manhattan at <a href="http://www.turtlebay-nyc.org/history.html">Turtle Bay</a> where Johannes was a brickmaker. Being "very sick," he filed a <a href="../../sources.html#aw">will</a> in January 1733. It named Cornelia and three children as heirs. The will passed  probate in April 1734. 

<p>Johannes Ryckman was not alive but his children were provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">will</a> filed by his father in December 1736. His widow may have survived until 1761.</p>
