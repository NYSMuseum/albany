<strong>Ahasuerus Roseboom</strong></a> was born in April 1700. He was the son of <a href="geroseboom1609.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../s/masanders1434.html">Maria Sanders</a> Roseboom. He grew up in a trader's home located near "Roseboom's gate."

<p>In November 1725, he married <a href="../b/mabradt4357.html">Maria Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1734, three children had been christened in Albany where he received services and was a regular baptism sponsor. His marriage was not a long one as his wife died in November 1745.

<p>This Roseboom family lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Ahasuerus was known as a <a href="../../census1756.html#69">shoemaker</a>, <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchant</a>, and flour bolter. By the mid-1760s, substantial <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a> of his property included the holdings of his sons.

<p>He served the community as a municipal offficer. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1732">1732</a>, he first was elected assistant alderman. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1745">1745</a>, he was chosen alderman for the third ward. Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3">1742</a>, his name appeared on lists of Albany freeholders. In 1746, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willroroseboom.html">will</a> filed by his brother.


<p>Ahasuerus Roseboom filed a <a href="../../wills/willahroseboom1533.html">will</a> in December 1770. His real property holdings included three dwelling houses in Albany. He was dead by the time the will passed probate in March 1774.</p>
