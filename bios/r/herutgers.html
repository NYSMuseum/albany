<P>Wartime <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">ref</a>ugee <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick Rutgers</strong></a> was born in New York in February 1712. He was the second son of Harmanus Rutgers and his first wife, Catharina Meyer Rutgers. The <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/1999-04/0924041138">will</a> filed by his illustrious father in 1750 left a  large estate to his widow and then to his children. Harmanus Rutgers died in 1753.

<p>In June 1732, Hendrick married New York native Catharina De Peyster in the Dutch church at Esopus. Their first child was christened in New York that November. The <a href="http://www.onentofl.com/chbiblerutgers.html">marriage</a> may have produced ten children including fourth son "Henry" Rutgers (1745-1830) who became a prominent Revolutionary and then New York State official.

<p>Family-based <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V5kyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22hendrick+rutgers%22+1779&source=bl&ots=3zkKoXREu8&sig=Tcm_AFHWwc8g942RhaZoE4lAVio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m0MqUdaiCYiD0QHB6oH4DQ&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#">resources</a> tell us that, like his father, Hendrick was a brewer and Manhattan farmer of some note during the middle decades of the eighteenth century.

<p>Traditional <a href="../../res/ts.html">resources</a> reveal that after the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, <a href="http://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/rul/libs/scua/university_archives/henry_rutgers.shtml">he</a> was among those who found <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">refuge</a> in Albany. In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#heru">1779</a>, his third ward real property was assessed substantially. Perhaps that was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NZx3gehXILIC&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=will+%22harme+rutgers%22&source=bl&ots=DLH0Tr7IZt&sig=xMqvRqD9xR51WLrdL0X_9rB-Sjc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4NYpUaq_IuSQ0QHu4IGIBg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=will%20%22harme%20rutgers%22&f=false">property</a> once owned by his father.


<p>The notorious <i><a href="../../guide/histres.html#rg">New-York Gazetteer</a></i> for July 13, 1779 <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22hendrick+rutgers%22+1779&sig=Tcm_AFHWwc8g942RhaZoE4lAVio&ei=m0MqUdaiCYiD0QHB6oH4DQ&id=V5kyAQAAMAAJ&ots=3zkKoXREu8&output=text">announced</a> that “died at Albany, in his sixty-ninth year, Hendrick Rutgers, Esq., a member of the Dutch Reformed Church and a gentleman of very large estate in this (New York) city." That estate was divided among his widow and children. He had been living in Albany for fewer than five years.</p>
