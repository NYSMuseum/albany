<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Radley</strong></a> was born in October 1735. He was the sixth child born to the marriage of <a href="jaradcliff1049.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="../b/cabovie7384.html">Catharina Bovie</a> Radcliff. He grew up a member of a large mainline family on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. At this point, we have encountered only one "Philip" on the family rolls. 
      <p>We seek information on his first three decades of adulthood - a time 
        when, except for <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company 
        rosters from the 1760s for <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#1177">Albany</a> 
        and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck, variants 
        of the name "Philip Radcliff" have not been encountered in the community-based 
        record. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a> he was not in Albany 
        during the 1750s or 1770s. 
      <p>In February 1786. "Philip Redlif" married "Newman" <a href="../h/nahall1023.html">Naomi 
        Hall</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that 
        time, this individual would have been almost fifty-one and his bride thirty 
        years younger. However, by 1794, the marriage had produced four children. 
        Earlier, he had been a regular baptism sponsor at the Dutch church. 
      <p>Beginning during the late 1780s, he was an Albany mainliner. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1177">1788</a>, 
        the personal property of "Philip J. Radley" was valued under a first ward 
        householder. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1177">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html#1177">1800</a> 
        he was identified as the head of household at what became 68 <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver 
        Street</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his 
        real and personal property were valued most modestly. 
      <p>The first two city directories in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA84,M1">1813</a> 
        and 1814, identified the home of Philip Radley at 68 Beaver Street. He 
        was dead within a year. In 1815, and for a number of years afterwards, 
        his widow was listed in the city directory as the householder at 68 Beaver. 
        She died in 1855 at the age of ninety.</p>
