<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</A>aditional sources, <a href="../../nnd.html">New</a> Netherland pioneer <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Janse</strong></a> was the patriarch of the <a href="ryckman.html">Ryckman</a> family of early Albany. He probably was born in Holland and emigrated to America with his wife who appears to have been known as "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Tr</a>yntje Jans." <a href="../j/trynjans.html">Her story</a>, however, appears to have more <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=tryntie+jans+ryckman&source=bl&ots=9P7XBXjzXG&sig=Xv5szCfdjPDXaYMgu2K4GOodJtg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=93IVVdGnMIHcoASi9YLQDA&ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=tryntie%20jans%20ryckman&f=false">potential</a> for development.

<p>Future city father <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert Janse Ryckman</a> was their son and perhaps their only child. One <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/surnames/ryckman.shtml">Harman Janse Ryckman</a> may have been Jan Janse's brother or some other kinsman.
 
      <p>The name of this subject does not seem to have been included on the <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">lists</a> 
        of fur traders who petitioned the Court of Beverwyck in 1660 or among 
        those who received houselots in the village a half decade earlier. The 
        translators <a href="../../res/trans.html">and</a> editors of the community-based 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#court">court minutes</a> for the 1650s 
        and 60s believed that the "Jan Janse" whose name appears in those records 
        referenced someone else. Thus, we have added little new learning to his 
        story. 
      <p>Jan Janse Ryckman is said to have passed on by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=tryntie+jans+ryckman&source=bl&ots=9P7XBXjzXG&sig=Xv5szCfdjPDXaYMgu2K4GOodJtg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=93IVVdGnMIHcoASi9YLQDA&ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=tryntie%20jans%20ryckman&f=false">July 1663</a> when his widow already was remarried to <a href="http://www.registerstar.com/windham_journal/news/article_f55377ff-d7e7-5be3-ab0c-f4b206981bb3.html">Elbert Gerbertsen Cruyff</a> - the step father and benefactor of Albert Janse Ryckman.

<p>With little in the way of resources in our view, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> from the life of this Ryckman family patriarch.  </p>

        <p><b>working notes</b>: [3/25/15] If his death date (at least by 1663) is correct, we 
          are not surprised that the life of this first settler has not appeared 
          in the community-based resources encountered to date. A number of Beverwyck/Albany 
          contemporaries were known or at least referenced as "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Jan 
          Janse</a>." <Br>
