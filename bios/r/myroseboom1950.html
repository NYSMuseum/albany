<P><a href="#sources"><b>Myndert Roseboom</b></a> probably was born before 1680. He was the son of Albany settlers <a href="heroseboom1622.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../l/gylansing3332.html">Gysbetie Lansing</a> Roseboom.</p>


<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#162">1697</a>, the young man was living alone in an Albany house. Two years later, he signed an <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#1950">oath</a> pledging loyalty to the king of England. In November 1705, Myndert Roseboom  married Albany native <a href="../v/mavinhagen3425.html">Maria Vinhagen</a>. By 1716, five of their children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, a deacon, and occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>These Rosebooms lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where he served as firemaster, constable, and then high constable. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">Assessment rolls</a> for the early 1700s imposed low taxes on his Albany property. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1950">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of eligible freeholders in the second ward. He also belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. His father and three brothers were Albany residents who also lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> near "Roseboom's gate" during the early 1720s.</p> 

<p>However, Myndert's life was cut short when he died in October 1722 still in his early forties. Surrounded by her children and extended families, his widow survived in their second ward home until her death in 1760.</p>
