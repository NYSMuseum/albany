<strong>Magdalena Ryckman</strong></a> was born in March 1689. She was the daughter of Albany mainstays <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert Janse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Neeltie Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. She grew up a younger daughter of a large family in the <a href="../../im/im1686.html">riverside</a> home of a prominent brewer and civic leader.

<p>In November 1720, she married a somewhat younger <a href="../b/bebradt4213.html">Benjamin Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the next decade, five children were christened in the Albany church where she was a frequent baptism sponsor along with her husband who succeeded his father as the church sexton. 

<p>These Bradts raised their family in a modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Benjamin made a living as a <a href="../../census1756.html#37">mason</a> and by performing other city-based services.

<p>In December 1736, Magdalena was left household goods and a share of the estate in the <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">will</a> filed by her father. Her husband was named co-executor.

<p>Magdalena Ryckman Bradt was still alive in 1750 when she was one of two living sisters named in the <a href="../../wills/willharyckman1921.html">will</a> filed by her brother.

<p>After that, her name seems to be absent from the community record. Her husband survived into the 1770s and several of her <a href="../b/mabradt4266.html">children</a> became Albany residents.</p>
