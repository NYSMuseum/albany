<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelia Ryckman</b></a> was born in 1723. She was the daughter of <a href="wiryckman1995.html">Wilhelmus</a> and Anna Wyngaert Ryckman and was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/scdybap7.htm">christened</a> in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> at Schenectady on January 19. She was the grand-daughter of Albany resident <a href="piryckman1983.html">Pieter Ryckman</a> and was included in the will he <a href="../../wills/willpiryckman1983.html">filed</a> in 1747.</p>


<p>By the early 1750s, she had married Albany businessman <a href="../p/joprice6447.html">John Price</a>. Perhaps she had no children. She was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she witnessed a number of baptisms beginning in 1752.</p>

<p>These Prices lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where her husband acquired a number of additional lots, kept boarders, served in the Revolutionary movement, and later was elected an alderman.</p>
 

<p>John Price filed a <a href="../../wills/willjoprice6447.html">will</a> in December 1791. It named Cornelia as his wife and heir along with a number of nieces, nephews, and godsons. He died a few days later. Cornelia then became the <a href="../../census1800.html#cory">head</a> of their first ward home. She freed her slave, George, in 1804. 


<p>Cornelia Ryckman Price <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&dq=%22in+memory+of+cornelia+price%22&source=bl&ots=SqaxYPskzl&sig=TVZD3UEGAa0BDkWwIJCFk7PnvKY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LtYPUcXHCamB0QHbiIDYDA&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22in%20memory%20of%20cornelia%20price%22&f=false">died</a> in July 1813 a few months shy of her ninetieth birthday. She was buried in the Dutch church cemetery plot. Her will is <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">said</a> to have passed probate in Albany in September 1818.</p>
