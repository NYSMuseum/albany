<P>City father <A href="#biography"><B>Albert Janse</B></A> probably was born during the 1640s. He was the son of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> pioneers <a href="joryckman.html">Jan Janse</a> and <a href="../j/trynjans.html">Tryntje Jans</a>. Perhaps he was their only child. Their descendants are known by the surname "<a href="ryckman.html">Ryckman</a>."</P>

<P>By the mid-1660s, Albert had married <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Cornelia Quackenbush</a> - daughter of a Beverwyck brickmaker. These Ryckmans became prominent Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#ryckman">householders</a> with a large family of at least twelve children. Both parents were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and were active in church affairs.</P>

<p><a name=brew></a>Albert Janse was a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> - perhaps the most prominent Albany brewmaster of the late seventeenth century. <a href="#1686"><img src="../../images/1686brewery.jpg" align=left width = 250 height=104 border=1 vspace=2 hspace=4 alt="the Ryckman brewery in 1686"></a>Among his clients were the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> and the Dutch church where Deacon Ryckman frequently supplied beer for funerals and other occasions. His house and brewery were located riverside stretching along the east side of today's <a href="../../streets.html#market">Broadway</a>. As the premier producer of one of the most highly sought early American commodities, Albert Ryckman became quite wealthy - with a property <a href="#assessment">assessment</a> comparable to that of the most successful fur traders. In 1690, he also was identified as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#mer">merchant</a>  and was dealing in materials for repairing canoes. He also acquired a number of house and garden <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lots</a> close to the shoreline. Sometimes, he was referred to as "Captain" Ryckman. In <a href="../../census1697.html#048">1697</a>, 
            his household included three additional men - probably three of his 
            grown sons Johannes, <a href="piryckman1983.html">Pieter</a>, <a href="alryckman1906.html">Albert, 
            Jr.</a>, or <a href="haryckman1921.html">Harmanus</a>.</p>

          <p>His overall wealth and status were reflected in an appointment to the first 
            <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> as alderman and 
            assessor for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> in 1686. 
            He would be reelected annually the council seat until he was appointed 
            <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany in 1702. He served 
            for a year - the only member of his family to achieve such high distinction. 
            Approaching sixty, Albert Ryckman then retired from public life and seems to have been most involved in furthering the interests of his 
            sons.</p>
 
<p>Albert Ryckman filed his <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">will</a> in 1736. Probably into his nineties, at that time he still thought of himself as an "Albany county brewer." Although Cornelia was still alive, she was not mentioned when he divided his estate among his living children. He died in January 1737 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The long life of <B>Albert Janse Ryckman</B> 
            is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 1905. This profile is derived 
            chiefly from <a href="ryckman.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The most substantial 
            printed source on this family still may be "Albert Janse Ryckman and 
            his wife Neeltje Quackenbush and some of their descendants," compiled 
            by Mrs. Harry S. Fitz Randolph (Jackson Heights, 1956), typescript 
            copy in the local history holdings of the <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/">New 
            York State Library</a>.</P>

<p><a name=1686></a>Detail from the <a href="../../1686.html#image">Albany overview</a> depicting what the artist and cooperating historians believe was the location of the <b>Ryckman brewery</b> in 1686. <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">Jonathan Pearson</a> and other antiquarian writers have placed his home at the southwest corner of Broadway and Hudson streets. That would be wholly inconsistent with the community records which uniformly identified him as a resident of the <a href="../../wards.html">third ward</a>. In 1720, he still was identified as a resident of the third ward. Perhaps later in life he relocated to the Hudson Street corner - a place of residence for subsequent generations of Ryckmans.

<p><a name=assessment></a>In 1702, his third ward property was <b>assessed</b> at 80 pounds - placing his worth in the community's top five percent.</p></font size>
