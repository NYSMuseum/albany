<strong>Jacob J. Roseboom</strong></a> was born in November 1740. He was the only child born to the marriage of Albany natives <a href="joroseboom1928.html">Johannes Jac. Roseboom</a> and <a href="macryckman1974.html">Machtel Ryckman</a> Roseboom. His father probably died  before the boy reached adolescence as his mother was raising Jacob in her father's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> Albany house that was  <a href="../../wills/willtoryckman.html">left</a> to Machtel in 1768.

<p>In January 1763, he married Albany native <a href="../l/heslansing3399.html">Hester Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Seven months later, the first of their ten children was christened in the Albany church where both parents were members, pewholders, and baptism sponsors.

<p>In 1766, Jacob already had entered public life when he <a href="../../solconst.html#1667">signed</a> the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. From then on, he took his place on the Albany mainline. He belonged to a city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company, paid modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">taxes</a> on his first ward property, and held a number of public positions in his ward beginning with that of <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>. In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, he first was elected assistant alderman  for the first ward. Re-elected each year, he served until 1775 when the municipal government gave way to  the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, he began to contribute support for the Revolutionary cause. He was a captain in the first regiment of the Albany County militia. He seems to have held that post at least until 1781 when his company was on duty in Albany.  In 1776, he was elected to the Committee of Correspondence - representing the first ward. He was an active member for the next year. In September 1780, he was called a "gentleman" of the city of Albany when he <a href="../../cddc.html">posted</a> someone else's bond.

<p>After the war, his <a href="../../census1790.html#1667">residence</a> was in the third ward where he was known as a merchant. In April <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#1667">1788</a>, he signed a petition taking issue with the proposed constituion and  published by an Albany antifederal committee. That year, his house and lot received a modest <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1667">assessment</a>.  During the 1780s and 90s, he bought and sold parcels of land in Albany.  

<p>Jacob J. Roseboom died in April 1797 and was buried from his church. His will passed probate in January 1808.  His widow took up residence on <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a> and lived until 1826.</p>
