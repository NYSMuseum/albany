<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gysbert Roseboom</b></a> was baptized on December 15, 1697. He was the son of <a href="geroseboom1609.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../s/masanders1434.html">Maria Sanders</a> Roseboom. He grew up with several siblings who became Albany residents in a trader's home near "Roseboom's gate." </p>


<p>In December 1720, he married young <a href="../b/cabries6337.html">Catharina (or Christina) Bries</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1741, six children had been baptized in the Albany church where he was an occasional godparent. Each birth and passing was carefully noted on the endpages of his <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible28.htm">family bible</a>.</p>

<p>In 1723, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the second ward. He was elected assistant alderman in 1727 and again in 1728. At that time, he owned land near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. In 1733, he petitioned for land outside the stockade and north of the "Schenectady <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">highway</a>."</p>

<p>In 1742, his name appeared on a list of qualified <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1620">voters</a> in the third ward. In 1746, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willroroseboom.html">will</a> filed by his brother.</p>


<p>Gysbert Roseboom died in October 1749 and was buried from the Dutch church. His wife lived until 1760.</p>
