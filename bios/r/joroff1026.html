      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Roff</b></a> probably was born during the 
        1730s. He may have been the "John Raef" who was an enlisted man in the 
        <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company of John Winne in 
        August 1757.</p>
      <p>In October 1763, he obtained a lot along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a> from the Albany government. In 1776, he pruchased a land partly 
        in Rensselaerswyck and partly in Albany and along the highway that led 
        to the mills at <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. He 
        made his home there - on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> 
        near the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a> for the rest of 
        his life!</p>
      <p>He married <a href="chroff.html">Christina</a> - the mother of his children. 
        He was a member of the growing German-ancestry <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html#roff">enclave</a> 
        that emerged on Albany's north side following the end of the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven 
        Years War</a>.</p>
      <p>John Roff was a Hudson River skipper and a merchant of modest means. 
        His Albany home also included a shop which was rented to small vendors.</p>
      <P>The War for Independence caused him some discomfort! In 1775, he was 
        transporting people and cargoes for the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany 
        committee</a> and contributing money to the American cause. A year later, 
        he was denounced as a merchant who charged high prices and was confined 
        to the Tory jail. Promising good behavior, he was released. However, he 
        left Albany without a pass, was apprehended, and again was required to 
        sign the oath of allegiance. In 1777, his children were afflicted with 
        smallpox and were removed from Albany. In Canada, the Revolutionaries 
        reported that Roff was known as a "friend of the king." 
      <p>In February 1781, he was appointed to administer the estate of his deceased 
        <a href="wmregal1502.html">brother-in-law</a>. 
      <p>The end of the war restored Roff to business. But his sailing days were 
        over and he kept boarders. His modest home was listed valued in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1026">1788</a> 
        and his houseold was configured on the city <a href="../../census1790.html#1026">census 
        roll</a> in 1790.</p>
      <p>John Roff died in October 1800 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church. 
        His wife was noted as the head of the household on the second Federal 
        census in <a href="../../census1800.html#2115">1800</a>. She carried on 
        at #1 North Market Street for a number of years.</p>

        <a name=sources></a> <B>Sources:</B> The life of John Roff/Raaf/Raef/Ralph 
        is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1026. Sometimes he 
        was referred to as Johann Wilhelm Roff. This profile is derived chiefly 
        from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We believe 
        he was of German ancestry and seek defining information on his background 
        and origins! Care must be taken to not confuse him with Colonel John Roff 
        of the Mohawk Valley!</font></p>
