<P><A href="#sources"><B>Elsje Rutgers</B></A> was born in New York colony during the mid 1670s. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="harutger.html">Harmen</a> and <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Catharina De Hooges Rutgers. We <a href="../../res/ts.html">say</a> (but not definitively) that she was born in Albany where her parents had married a few years earlier.</P>

      <P>On January 1, 1694 she married Albany native <a href="../s/dadschuyler1263.html">David 
        D. Schuyler</a> - a son of Albany's premier <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew 
        Netherland ancestry <a href="../s/schuyler.html">family</a>. At least 
        six of her children would be christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> church between 1695 and 1715. Like her husband, she was a prominent 
        church member and a frequent baptism sponsor</P>

<p>In March 1711, she was named among the heirs in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=C1QOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22harmanus+rutgers+of+new+york+brewer%22&source=bl&ots=lefUw_sUnS&sig=lNca_Mbcb8chNIFWGS9nlODgWd0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjUiKnLxaDYAhWIRSYKHUJLCvQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&q=%22harmanus%20rutgers%20of%20new%20york%20brewer%22&f=false">will</a> of her father and identified as the wife of David Schuyler of Albany.

<p>These Schuylers began to raise their family in the Market Street <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1263">home</a> of an emerging businessman who would be appointed sheriff and then mayor of Albany in 1706. However, Elsie's marriage would not be a long one.
	
<p>David D. Schuyler died in 1715 at age forty-six - leaving her with several small children.<a href="#port"><image src="../../images/jpg/elsrutgers.jpg" align=right border=1 width=200 height=260"></a> </p>

      <p>Probably in her fifties In 1722, widow Elsie married the much older Reverend 
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=idQQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA872&lpg=PA872&dq=%22petrus+vas%22&source=bl&ots=jITcIHHVHS&sig=cyW-x29bMOltPyw4YPQM-YOVRyQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwins9-bv6DYAhWM7iYKHfsSCQs4FBDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&q=%22petrus%20vas%22&f=false">Petrus 
        Vas</a> in the New York City Dutch Church. <a href="https://www.ancestry.ca/genealogy/records/jannetjen-dorland_33341535">Perhaps</a> 
        she was his second wife. Gerardus Duyckinck <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/327007970/Portrait-Artists-Duyckinck-I">is 
        said to have painted</a> her portrait the next year. Her husband served 
        as Dominie of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Dutch_Church_(Kingston,_New_York)#17th_and_18th_centuries">Kingston 
        Dutch church</a> from 1710 to just before his death in 1756. Perhaps they 
        had met when Vas came to Albany to provide service for the temporarily 
        (<a href="../../drc.html#list">1710-12</a>) vacant Albany church. 
      <p>Vas served in Kingston for at least another decade - but <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ces4PxsVXjcC&pg=PA581&lpg=PA581&dq=vas+kingston&source=bl&ots=uy49lSs3bW&sig=nw63c7ZFHE6RZ6uSl9rER0Ligyw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi529fLxqDYAhXGNiYKHbE1BV8Q6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&q=vas%20kingston&f=false">apparently</a> much <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/42889960.pdf">longer</a>. After that, his whereabouts is less certain. He is said to have died in 1756. Elsje Rutgers Schuyler Vas <a href="../../res/ts.html">may</a> have been alive in 1752. We seek more definitive information on her <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.</p>
