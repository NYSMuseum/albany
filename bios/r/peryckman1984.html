<strong>Petrus Ryckman, Jr.</strong></a> was born in November 1708. He was the youngest child in the small family of <a href="piryckman1983.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../k/coketeltas.html">Cornelia Keteltas</a> Ryckman. He grew up in a tailor's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1730">1730</a>, he was appointed constable for the first ward. The next year, he was chosen high constable. In 1731, he was paid for services from the city treasury.
 
<p>In July 1734, he was almost twenty-six when he married Kingston native Catharina Kierstede at the Kingston Dutch church. Their daughter was born five months later. The marriage produced at least four children - christened in Kingston and <a href="../../drc.html">Albany</a>. However, more children might have been expected.

<p>Probably during the 1730s, Petrus relocated to Kingston and seems to have lived out his life in Ulster County. 

<p>In September 1747, he was named executor and a principal beneficiary in the <a href="../../wills/willpiryckman1983.html">will</a> filed by his Albany resident father. However, he died before Pieter Ryckman and Petrus's widow was named to replace him in 1750.

<p>Petrus Ryckman, Jr. filed a <a href="../../wills/willperyckman1984.html">will</a> in August 1749. At that point, he was living in Kingston and stated that he was sick and weak in body. The will named his wife and a son and daughter as heirs. He owned a house and lot in Albany and personal property. The will passed probate on October 3, 1749.</p>
