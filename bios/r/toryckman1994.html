<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Tobias Ryckman</strong></a> was born in October 1686. He was a younger son in the large family of Albany brewer and civic leader <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert Janse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Neeltie Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. He grew up at his father's riverside brewing complex.

<p>In August 1715, he married Albany native <a href="../b/helbeekman3887.html">Helena Beekman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1723, three children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>Like his father, Tobias became a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a>. He took up residence in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where he was an Albany mainstay for the next five decades. His name appeared on lists of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">freeholders</a>, assessment rolls, and the <a href="../../census1756.html#228">census of householders</a> taken by the British army in 1756. He represented the first ward on the <a href="../../corporation.html">common council</a> as an assistant (1725) and then as alderman - first in 1729. He was a contractor of the city and belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 

<p>By the mid-1760s, assessments valued his property near the top in terms of wealth. By that time, his son-in-law, <a href="../t/barte4845.html">Barent H. Ten Eyck</a>, had joined him in the brewing business. He owned additional houses, buildings, and lots in Albany as well as a house on the dock along the <a href="../../im/im1770.html">waterfront</a>.

<p>Tobias Ryckman filed a <a href="../../wills/willtoryckman.html">will</a> in April 1765. At that time he was almost eighty and living with his daughter, <a href="macryckman1974.html">Machtel Roseboom</a>. He died sometime thereafter. The will passed probate in March 1786.
