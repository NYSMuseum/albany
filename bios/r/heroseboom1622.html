<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Roseboom</b></a> (Hendrick Janse) was the patriarch of the <a href="roseboom.html">Roseboom family</a> of early Albany.</p> 

<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">t</a>raditional sources, he <a href="http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/17th/dny_22.shtml#roseboom">emigrated</a> to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> about 1660. He established a home at <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> which  became Albany in 1664. By that time, he was known as a fur <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#1622">trader</a> and then a property owner. His house and lot were located on what became the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> and incorporated the northern wall of the stockade. For many years, the Pearl Street passage out of town was known as "<a href="../../im/im1686.html">Roseboom's Gate</a>."</p> 


<p>His first wife was <a href="../l/gylansing3332.html">Gysbertie Lansing</a> - the mother of at least five Roseboom children. In December 1695, he was a widower when he married Widow Tryntje Jans at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he had been a member, undertaker, and sexton for many years.</p>

<p>Hendrick Janse served the community as a constable, contractor, and juror. In <a href="../../census1679.html#1622">1679</a>, his property was enumerated on the Albany assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1697.html#103">1697</a>, his household was configured on the city census. Two years later, he stood with his neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#1622">swearing</a> allegiance to the king of England.</p>
  
<p>Hendrick Roseboom, Sr. died in December 1703 and was buried from the Dutch church. His descendants spread out in <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> and beyond!</p>
