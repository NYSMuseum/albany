      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Pieter Ryckman</strong></a> probably was born 
        during the 1670s. He was the son of Albany founders <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert 
        Janse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Cornelia Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. 
        He grew up in a large Albany family whose lives revolved around his father's 
        riverside <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewery</a>. He probably 
        was one of the four adult males living in his father's house in <a href="../../census1697.html#048">1697</a>. 
      <p>In May 1696, he married <a href="../k/coketeltas.html">Cornelia Keteltas</a> 
        at the New York City Dutch church. By 1708, the mariage had produced at 
        least four children who were christened at the New York and then Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch churches</a> where he was an occasional 
        baptism sponsor. 
      <p>These Ryckmans lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
        where Pieter was a tailor and small scale merchant. His modest holdings 
        were <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1983">assessed</a> on municipal 
        tax lists. He also owned other parcels of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> 
        within the Albany borders. In June 1737, his lot was referenced in the 
        <a href="../../wills/willjrosie.html">will</a> filed by a neighbor. In 
        <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1983">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1983">1742</a>, 
        his name appeared on lists of first ward freeholders. He also belonged 
        to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 
      <p>After serving as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, in 
        1713, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a> 
        - for a year in the third ward, and for four subsequent terms in the first 
        ward. 
      <p>He filed a <a href="../../wills/willpiryckman1983.html">will</a> in September 
        1747. His wife was dead but he provided for his children and grandchildren. 
        Living into his seventies, Pieter Ryckman died in 1748 and was buried 
        in the Dutch church cemetery on September 4.
