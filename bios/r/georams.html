<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the name of <a href="#sources"><strong>George Ramsay</strong></a> was listed on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1800.html#gera">1800</a> as the head of a first ward household. His home consisted of a couple (both born prior to 1756) and two younger people. A decade <a href="../../census1790.html#gera">earlier</a>, a young couple under his name were identified on the census of surrounding <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. With more than one same-named contemporary at <a href="#second">risk</a> in the region, at this point we seek defining information on the <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> of the future city resident and his path to Albany. He <a href="#atan">appears</a> to have been of <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish ancestry.

<p>In 1776, <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> George Ramsay <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/hanson/10.html">ran afoul</a> of the Schenectady <a href="../../coc.html">Comm</a>ittee of Correspondence for allegedly espousing pro-royalist sentiments. A month <a href="http://www.secondalbany.org/2nd_albany_cos_page_feb76.html">later</a>, he was ordered to be sent to Albany for confinement. Reaching Albany, he was <a href="https://ia601601.us.archive.org/6/items/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1.pdf">fined</a>. No further notice of him appeared in the available Committee minutes. [We remain cautious here as more than one individual may be at-risk.]

<p>In September 1783, George Ramsey  <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22george+ramsey%2C+nency+stonert%22">and</a> one "Nency Stonert" witnessed a baptism at the Albany Dutch church. In November 1784, "George Remsay" married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Grisswell Coultrek" at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In July 1788, George Ramsay married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Christian Smith" by "certificate." No children appear to have been christened to him in that church. Perhaps these Ramsays were <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Pres</a>byterians.

<p>In August 1797, his name first appeared in a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">book of freeholders</a> living in the second ward. At that time and afterwards on that roll, he was identified as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html">merchant</a>.

      <p>In 1800 and '01, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">identified</a> 
        as a grocer and scheduled to pay ten dollars for a license. 
      <a name=atan></a>
<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GpUPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22george+ramsay%22+albany&source=bl&ots=EJhZb6y1zY&sig=2VqgX6TuzYlsqll5iGbNsZmVfsc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihpdXIpInMAhXDPD4KHT41CKoQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&q=%22george%20ramsay%22%20albany&f=false">1803</a>, he was identified as vice-president at the first meeting of the Albany <a href="../../org/standsoc.html">St. Andrew's Society</a>. He served as president from 1805 to 1807 and perhaps again in 1811. A namesake <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GpUPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22george+ramsay%22+albany+presbyterian&source=bl&ots=EJhZc4E2qT&sig=R1GT4xsNiVv7xmWzqOatF4RhcD0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwinlvr65IvMAhXGVj4KHQvCBZgQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20ramsay%22&f=false">son</a> later occupied a leadership position in this Scottish friendship organization.

<p>Perhaps this <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_a_l.htm">George Ramsey</a> leased a farm in Bethlehem from the Van Rensselaers in 1805.

   
      <p>In January 1808, George Ramsay was among the State Street notables who 
        were <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#state">invited</a> to the funeral 
        of Henry J. Bleecker. After that, no definitive references for his life 
        have yet been encountered in the community-based record nor in our most 
        resent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based resources</a>. 
        At this point, we do not believe that he was connected to one-time Albany 
        resident <a href="adram.html">Adam Ramser</a>. 
<p>Missing defining demographic information and knowing that more than one same-named contemporary/individual was at-risk in the region, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany grocer George Ramsay.
