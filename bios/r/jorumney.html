<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jonathan Rumney</strong></a> lived in Albany during the mid-1760s. Perhaps he was the descendant of English soldier <a href="jonrumney.html">Jonathan Rumney</a> who died in Albany in 1722. <a href="../../res/guess.html">W</a>as he <a href="http://www.yasni.com/ext.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Farchiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com%2Fth%2Fread%2Fquackenbush%2F2009-02%2F1233581837&name=Jonathan+Rumney&cat=heritage&showads=1">born</a> early in 1744 and christened in New Brunswick, New Jersey as the son of Benjamin and Maria Rumney?

<p>A number of same-named individuals are at risk during his lifetime.


<p>In 1766, this particular individual was among those city people who signed a <a href="../../solconst.html#joru">constitution</a> for the Albany Sons of Liberty. In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#joru">1767</a>, he was identified as an "enlisted man" in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. However, his name was not found on <a href="../../sources.html#uny">available lists</a> of assessment rolls and other surveys for the 1760s.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, his name appeared on the <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924027054570/cu31924027054570_djvu.txt">muster roll</a> of a New York Regiment of Levies. However, his name was absent from a list of those who afterwards qualified for a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22rachel+meinersse%22&source=bl&ots=I7qqcMB3Ky&sig=S9quvedQp2PyaBHBzRRBplPCXlo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nC0IUJS_EIHj0QGX0ITzAw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22rachel%20meinersse%22&f=false">Perhaps</a> this John Rumney married one "Rachel Meinersse" on August 28, 1784 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Children were christened by them in 1785 and 1787. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1786sl">1786</a>, "Jno. G Rumney" subscribed 8 shillings toward the salary of a second Dutch Reformed minister. Later, in the document the notation "remov'd" followed his name. 

<p>A "Mr. John Rumney" <a href="http://ontario.nygenweb.net/earlygenevanewsmarriagedeath.htm">died</a> in Geneva, New York in October 1808 at the age of sixty-three. That individual would have been born during the 1740s.

<p>This page most significantly organizes available information on the signer of the Sons of Liberty constitution of 1766. We seek defining information on the <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, life, and passing of one-time Albany area resident Jonathan Rumney. With many outstanding <a href="http://ontario.nygenweb.net/earlygenevanewsmarriagedeath.htm">questions</a>, we move on for now.</p>
