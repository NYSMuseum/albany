<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit Roseboom</b></a> was born in January 1732. He was the son of <a href="ahroseboom1533.html"> Ahasueras</a> and Maria Bradt Roseboom. He often was referred to as "Gerrit A. Roseboom."</p>

<p>The name of "Mrs. Geret Rosecomb" (<font size=-1>but shown as Gerret in the index</font size>) first appeared in the community record during the summer of 1756 when he was identified as a householder and an Indian <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> on a <a href="../../census1756.html#11">census</a> of Albany buildings made by the British army. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a>, he was appointed constable for the third ward. On a number of occasions, he was re-imbursed by the Albany city government. </p> 

<p>In November 1767, he married Elsje Roseboom at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage of the thirty-five-year-old man does not appear to have produced children. However, these Rosebooms occasionally served as baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>He seems to have lived with his father as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> from the 1760s taxed his property with his "father Ahwerus." In 1766, he joined Albany neighbors in signing the <a href="../../solconst.html#1611">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty as "Garret A. Roseboom." In 1770, he was left an Albany house and other property in the <a href="../../wills/willahroseboom1533.html">will</a> of his father. In 1772, he was left another house and lot in Albany in the estate of an uncle.</p>

<p>He appears to have spent some time beyond Albany . In July 1775, the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> sought information upon Roseboom's return from Canada. In 1777, he applied for permission to move his family. During the war years, he contributed resources and signed a number of petitions on behalf of Albany people. His Albany home was assessed on the city tax list in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>.



<p>Gerrit Roseboom died on July 7, 1787 at the age of fifty-four. He was buried five days later in the Dutch church cemetery plot. The home and property of his widow was valued on the third ward assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wgr">1788</a>.</p>
