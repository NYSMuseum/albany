<P>Referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Robert Rumney</strong></a> was born in 1709 and christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on October 30. He was the first son born to the marriage of <a href="jonrumney.html">Jonathan</a> and <a href="../vc/jovc.html">Johanna Van Corlear</a> Rumney. His English father, a former <a href="../../garrison.html">soldier</a>, died in 1722. A few years later, his Albany-born mother re-married and then re-located to New Jersey. Robert probably had siblings but current connections to other Albany "Rumneys" are tenuous and dictate caution.

<p>We have <a href="../qqqq.html">not</a> uncovered marriage or church affiliation information. Perhaps his sister married at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1730.

<p>Young Robert was an Albany resident. In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1734">1734</a>, he was appointed sole constable for the second ward. <a href="../../res/guess.html">P</a>erhaps he lived with an adult sibling at that time.

<p>In 1750, he was not among the grandchildren named in the <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a> filed by his mother's mother. At that time. Johanna Van Corlear Rumney Groesbeck was living in New Brunswick.  

<p>After 1734, the name of Robert <a href="../../res/sp.html">Rumney</a> has not yet been found in the community-based record. Perhaps, he did follow his mother to New Jersey. With unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> and loose connections, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
