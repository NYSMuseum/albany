<strong>Johannes Roseboom, Jr.</strong></a> was born in April 1694. He was the son of <a href="joroseboom1671.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../c/gecoster.html">Gerritje Coster</a> Roseboom. He grew up as part of a large family in the home of a prominent <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> businessman and city official. To prevent confusion with his prominent father and <a  href="joroseboom1673.html">cousin</a>, this individual was known as "Johannes Roseboom, Jr." 

<p>He does not appear to have married but may have witnessed some baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#1672">1715</a>, he may have been the "John Rose Boom" who was a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">troop</a> of horse. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1722">1722</a>, he was appointed constable in the second ward. The next year, he was named high constable. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1723">1723</a>, he was elected assistant alderman and subsequently served three more terms while his father was serving as alderman. Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1731">1731</a>,  he was elected alderman for the second ward and served for several years - although not consecutively.  

<p>During those years, his property on <a href="../../wards.html#2">Pearl Street</a> and along Foxes Creek was mentioned a number of times in the city records and in the <a href="../../wills/willjabeekman.html">wills</a> of his neighbors. He also was paid for services by the treasury.

<p>In November 1737, he was named along with his mother and five siblings in the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> filed by his father.
<p>In July 1748, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> of Dirck Ten Broeck.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1672">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1672">1763</a>, his name ("Jr.") appeared on lists of Albany freeholders.

<p>Johannes Roseboom, Jr. was dead by June 1765 when his heirs paid for a pall.</p>

The life of Johannes <a href="roseboom.html">Roseboom</a>, Jr. is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1672. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Although several individuals named Johannes Roseboom were active in Albany during the first half of the eighteenth century, the fairly consistent use of middle initials helps with the assignment of biographical information.
