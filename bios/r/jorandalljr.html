<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>John Randall (Randel), Jr.</strong></a> was born in December 1787 and christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church in January 1788. He was the son of <a href="jorandall.html">John Randall</a> (sometimes John  Jr. himself) and <a href="../f/cafairchild.html">Catherine Fairchild</a> Randall. Like his father, a prominent Albany brass founder, this "John Randall, Jr." had a surprising number of similarly named contemporaries. This sketch attempts to focus on the Albany life of the much more widely widely known <a href="../../trades/sur.html">surveyor</a> and innovator who mostly identified himself as "John Randel, Jr."

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#joran">1790</a>, he would have been one of two boys enumerated under his father's <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> home. In <a href="../../census1800.html#jora">1800</a>, he was about thirteen and would have been one of the eleven family members accounted for in his father's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> household.

<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/jorandalljr.jpg" align=right border=1 width=150 height=190 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="John Randall, Jr."></a>We seek information on his formal training. However, Surveyor General <a href="../d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a> appears to have been his mentor. De Witt later <a href="http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/24414?c=read&page=7">stated</a> that this Albany native had been with him in his office since "his minority" and that he had employed Randel on a number of projects. 

<p> In 1808, young John became a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.   

<p>By that <a href="http://www.crookedlakereview.com/articles/101_135/118winter2001/118minor.html">time</a>, he had begun to practice the trade/profession/art of the surveyor. In his own right, Randel conducted surveys and made a number of street <a href="../../guide/histres.html#map19">maps</a> of Albany and  beyond. His <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2gwOAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA720&lpg=PA720&dq=%22john+randall+jr%22+albany+survey&source=bl&ots=pCRirpnTRj&sig=TaazGRWr_0DIrq7IePDG4YsvsrU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9I8qULCILYOK6QGtt4CIDg&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20randall%20jr%22%20albany%20survey&f=false">client</a> was the city of Albany although we cannot say that he held the tile of city surveyor or city engineer. In 1810, he produced a <a href="http://www.albanycounty.com/achor/pdf/newsletter/Tivoli-Times-01_01.pdf">map</a> of the "post road" (today's Route 9) from Albany to New York City. That work measures twenty-three feet in length and resides at the Albany County Hall of Records.

<p>However, his fame lay far beyond the limits of his home town. In 1808, a distinguished commission awarded this young man a contract to survey and produce a street grid for the island of Manhattan. The first fruits of that incredible undertaking were published in 1811. That story and the long and varied career that followed is <a href="#holl">sufficiently chroniciled only by his modern biographer</a>. 

<p>On a number of occasions afterwards, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wAkyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA303&lpg=PA303&dq=%22john+randall+jr%22+albany+survey&source=bl&ots=H0GZ-i9rlB&sig=MsL0pRclJ3EQGfP_NkwQfz-_T5g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=w5EqUNeOBM7G6AGkn4HYAQ&ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22john%20randall%20jr%22%20albany%20survey&f=false">engaged</a> by the State of New York under the auspices of Surveyor General De Witt.

<p>He probably stood second only to State Surveyor General <a href="../d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a> among early Albany's  <a href="../../guide/histres.html#map19">map</a>makers.

<p>John Randel, Jr. married twice. His first wife was his cousin, Matilda Harrison, who was his assistant as well. After her death in 1823, he wed college-educated Letitia Massey of Philadelphia in 1827. The details of those unions are chronicled in his excellent new <a href="#holl">biography</a>.

<P>Although he had a number of primary residences in New York and New Jersey, he seems to have maintained a  property in Albany as well. By 1820, he was listed in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> as a surveyor at 168 North Market Street. He was at that address in 1830.

<p>Other (different) John Randall Jr's. were alive during his lifetime. One was a settler of Norwich in 1800 and held land there in 1798. He was a trustee of the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nychenan/1880-23b.htm"><i>Bank of Chenango</i></a>. In <a href="http://home.roadrunner.com/~nrw/history/railways/rgazette1.html">1833</a>, he was identified as the "chief engineer" of the <i>Ithaca & Owego Railroad</i>. At that time, he was a resident of Ithaca.
 
<p>John Randel, Jr. died in Albany in August 1865. Cause of <a href="../../res/death.html">de</a>ath is said to have been a "brain inflammation." We seek information on the particulars of his passing.

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. With publication of the exhustive biography noted below, this brief profile will serve best by focusing on his early career as a <a href="../../trades/sur.html">mapmaker</a> for Albany.

<p><a name=holl></a>A comprehensive biography by Margeurite Holloway entitled <a href="http://measureofmanhattan.com/"><i>The Measure of Manhattan: The Tulmultuous Career and Surprising Legacy of John Randel, Jr., Cartographer, Surveyor, Inventor</i></a> (New York: <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/The-Measure-of-Manhattan/">Norton</a>, 2013), has just appeared to become a prime resource for family and personal material on the Randalls/Randels. It certainly <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">merits</a> a much closer examination. <dd>Additionally: MCNY <a href="http://www.mcny.org/sidebars/randel-farm-maps-online.html">exhibition</a>; more <a href="https://www.google.com/#sclient=psy-ab&hl=en&q=%22john+randel%2C+jr%22&oq=%22john+randel%2C+jr%22&gs_l=hp.3..0j0i22i30.3136.13152.0.14265.19.19.0.0.0.0.183.1756.16j3.19.0...0.0...1c.1.9.psy-ab.3JhzunqsS3Y&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.&bvm=bv.45175338,d.dmg&fp=2a7bf35a575914cb&biw=1549&bih=603">online</a>.</dd>
