<P>Subsequent <a href="../../lutheran.html#sources">resources</a> tell us that Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Christopher Ruby</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Johan Christopher "Roube") was <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Christopher-Ruby/6000000011187956357">ch</a>ristened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> in October 1771. Thus, he was the son of <a href="coruby1056.html">Conrad</a> and <a href="../h/sahawke8371.html">Sara Hawke</a> Ruby. He grew up in his father's house which stood near the northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a> of today's <a href="../../streets.html#patroon">Clinton Avenue.</a> Conrad Ruby was dead by <a href="../../census1800.html#8371">1800</a> when the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household of widow "Sarah Ruby" was configured on the city census.
 
<p>In December 1794, he married <a href="../c/cacadog.html">Catharina Cadogen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> where he was a member, pewholder, <a href="https://archive.org/stream/manualfirstluth00lloygoog/manualfirstluth00lloygoog_djvu.txt">and</a> trustee. The Rubys were prominent Lutherans. The marriage may have <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Christopher-Ruby/6000000011187956357">produced</a> seven children.

<p>Like his father, Christopher <a href="#re">invested</a> in real estate. "Ruby Alley" which straddled the city line near their home recognized the locale's outstanding personages. Beginning in 1794, he moved to purchase <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lots</a> on the south side of Lumber Street which then was in Watervliet. At that time, he was identified as a cooper.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#chru">1800</a>, the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> counted the Christopher, his wife, and three children under ten.  

<p>Beginning in 1815, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> first listed him as a grocer at 128 North Market Street. In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=n1Y4AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA48&lpg=RA2-PA48&dq=%22christopher+ruby%22+albany&source=bl&ots=UYAC0HJriC&sig=xNmmQt_OBUQ9v1ap7DiXqevdtCc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwibv4e0nu_QAhWCaRQKHdtED0Q4ChDoAQgfMAE#v=onepage&q=%22christopher%20ruby%22%20albany&f=false">1815</a>, he was identified as an assistant alderman in the fifth ward.  In 1820, the directory identified Christopher Ruby as a justice and grocer located at 117 North Market Street. As late as 1830, Christopher Ruby was listed in the city directory as a grocer at corner of North Market and Lumber Streets.

<p>At various times during those years, he seems to have stood for a number of local offices and in <a href="http://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/RC0018">1824</a> was an unsuccessful candidate (he received one vote) "from Colonie" for the New York State Assembly.

<p>Christopher Ruby was dead by December 1833 when his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a>.</p>
