<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources">
<strong>James Radcliff</strong></a> was born in August 1761. Christened "Jacobus," he was the son of <a href="../../albanycounty.html">A</a>lbany-area residents Johannes and Margarita Passage Radcliff.

<p>In November 1783, he married Maria Ottman at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1792, the marriage had produced at least three children who were christened in the church. It seems that only their daughter survied to adulthood.

<p>These Radcliffs/Radleys made their <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1050">home</a> on what became <a href="../../streets.html#cow">Union Street</a> on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1050">1790</a>, his household included five members. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, only his modest personal property was valued on the first ward assessment. Subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#1050">census</a> returns charted the progression of that family over the next four decades. Beginning in 1813 and sporadically afterwards, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=%22cow+lane%22+radcliff&source=web&ots=2hJqK_-z8y&sig=XcAyZPHnqmQ5oc6NJ7hw6GRZWqo&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA84,M1">city directories</a> listed brothers James and <a href="heradcliff1046.html">Henry</a> Radcliff as the residents of 45 Union Street. Other James Radcliffs were listed in directories as well!

<p>Although appearing occasionally on community-based rosters and <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#1050">r</a>olls including a list of watchmen in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA160&lpg">1787</a>, he seems to have earned his livlihood as a laborer.

<p>The existence of a number of similarly named individuals in Albany after 1815 complicates assignment of qualitative information. 

<p>James Radcliff lost his wife when Maria died in May 1829. He passed on in May 1831 in his seventy-second year. He was buried from the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lu</a>theran Ebenezer Church. </p>
