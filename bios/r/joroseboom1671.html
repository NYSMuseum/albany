<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Roseboom</b></a> was born during the mid-seventeenth century. He was the eldest son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and Albany  pioneers <a href="heroseboom1622.html">Hendrick Janse</a> and <a href="../l/gylansing3332.html">Gysbertje Lansing</a> Roseboom.</p>

<p>As early as <a href="../../census1679.html#1671">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. He seems to have spent considerable time as a young man in pursuit of furs in the French and Indian territories to the north and west. He led one of the Albany trading groups that was captured and interred in <a href="../m/pamcgreg.html">1687</a>. In this and other trading ventures he was associated with <a href="../b/jjbleecker199.html">Johannes Bleecker, Jr.</a>, another Albany native,  who would marry the sister of Roseboom's bride-to-be!</p> 

<p>In November 1688, he was approaching middle age when he married <a href="../c/gecoster.html">Gerritje Coster</a> at that Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1706, nine children had been christened in Albany where he was a member, church officer, and baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>But like other family members, Johannes eventually settled down in Albany to become a mainline <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a>.  His home near "Roseboom's gate" was a Pearl Street <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#1671">landmark</a>. In <a href="../../census1697.html#125">1697</a>, his home was configured on the Albany census. Two years later, he signed a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#1671">petition</a> swearing allegiance to the king of England. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a> valued his Albany holdings comparable to those of other prominent merchants.</p>

<p>After serving as assistant alderman for the second ward, he was elected alderman in 1700 - beginning a tenure on the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> of more than twenty years. During that time, he was particularly active as one of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>.<p>   

<p><a name=jr>Johannes was in his seventies or eighties when he filed a "Dutch" language <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> in November 1737. It named his wife and six living children as heirs to property in Albany, Schenectady, and "along the Mohawk." 
 As late as <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1671">1742</a>, his name (or that of his <a href="joroseboom1928.html">two</a> younger <a href="joroseboom1673.html">nephews</a> - his same-named <a href="joroseboom1672.html">son</a> was listed separately) was still on the list of Albany freeholders. 

<p>Johannes Roseboom died in January 1745 and was buried beneath the Albany church. His estate still received <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc10431.htm">inquiries</a> as late as 1765.</p>
