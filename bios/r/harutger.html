<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Harme Rutgers</strong></a> was an Albany brewer and property owner during the last quarter of the seventeenth century. He appears to have been <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Harmen-Rutgers/6000000000240036348">born</a> during the 1640s. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a> he emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New</a> Netherland with his parents <a href="../vw/rjvwoert2637.html">Rutger Jacobse</a> and Catharina Van Schoendewort. At this point, we are unwilling to articulate a precise connection to the <a href="../vw/vwoert.html">Van Woert</a> family of early Albany. <a href="../qqqq.html">However</a>, going forward, his descendants were part of the prominent <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/scua/henry-rutgers">Rutgers</a> family of New York, New Jersey, and to some <a href="https://www.libraries.rutgers.edu/scua/henry-rutgers#cite_02">extent</a> Albany.


<p>In 1668, he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Catharina de Hooges - the mother of future Albany residents but not the same-named <a href="../d/cadhooges.html">wife</a> of another Albany resident. A <a href="elsrutgers.html">daughter</a> married future Albany mayor David D. Schuyler. We believe his <a href="../vw/mgtvwoert2613.html">sister</a> married Albany city father Jan Janse Bleecker. During the 1680s and 90s, both parents and their children were members of the Albany <a href="https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part1.html">Dutch church</a>.
		
<p>Harme Rutgers was the owner or part owner of a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewery</a>, house, and lot located east of what became <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> and extending to the river. In November <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IisWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA387&lpg=PA387&dq=harmen+rutgers&source=bl&ots=mIzF83e6eH&sig=A89V0wFj9l_-C2gD2U1kxXoKV9M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjE8ruF4qrZAhXOq1MKHe6KC9YQ6AEIXzAJ#v=onepage&q=harmen%20rutgers&f=false">1671</a>, he sold that property to <a href="../l/pilassing.html">Peter Lassing</a>.

<p>In April <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1PLXTZk1eUC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22harme+rutgers%22&source=bl&ots=m5e51VpS36&sig=6sx8DD75Ip3NM_Ni5xAMynUVnIM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiytruigq3ZAhWRoFMKHahUB9IQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=%22harme%20rutgers%22&f=false">1678</a>, he was charged by the sheriff with selling strong beer to the Indians - perhaps with the intention to enjoin him from the Albany <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1PLXTZk1eUC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22harme+rutgers%22&source=bl&ots=m5e51VpS36&sig=6sx8DD75Ip3NM_Ni5xAMynUVnIM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiytruigq3ZAhWRoFMKHahUB9IQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=%22harme%20rutgers%22&f=false">fur trade</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#102">1679</a>, his holdings were valued 
        substantially on an assessment of Albany property owners. He may have 
        been an absentee owner. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#1">1689</a>, 
        he was among the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> subscribers 
        to a fund for community defense. However, his name was absent from the 
        Albany <a href="../../census1697.html">census</a> taken in 1697. 
      <p>During the 1680s and 90s, he witnessed baptisms in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. He was listed with the church members in 1683.

<p>Stating that he was "ancient and weak" and that he was a brewer of New York, "Harmanus Rutgers" filed a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iIiJHEJVxh8C&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=37+%22harmanus+rutgers%22&source=bl&ots=vNxuNJ_b35&sig=fTLwr6qvc9xYWczdse34VUNtOdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiy1YrSr63ZAhWStlMKHShJCXUQ6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&q=37%20%22harmanus%20rutgers%22&f=false">will</a> in March 1710. It provided for his wife, two sons, and a daughter. The will passed probate in New York in April 1711. His heirs were mentioned in the Albany city records in August 1712. 

<p>Although he probably removed to New York City prior to 1700, as late as 1720, his Albany property "near the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> almshouse" was referenced.</p>
