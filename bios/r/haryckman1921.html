<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Harmanus Ryckman</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the son of Albany leader <a href="ajryckman1905.html">Albert Janse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2031.html">Cornelia Quackenbush</a> Ryckman. He grew up learning the brewer's art from his father. He joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1690. Over the years, he sponsored a number of baptisms.
 
<p>Harmanus Ryckman does not appear to have married. He seems to have lived in the <a href="../../census1697.html#048">house</a> of his father while also carrying on at the family <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewery</a>. Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#1921">1699</a>, his name appeared on community-based documents. In <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#1921">1715</a>, he was identified as a trooper in an Albany militia company. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1921">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1921">1742</a>, he was counted among the freeholders living near other Ryckman families in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In 1714, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the first ward. In 1722 and 1723, he was <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">elected</a> assistant alderman.

<p>In December 1736, he was named heir and co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willabjryckman.html">will</a> of his father.
  
<p>He filed a <a href="../../wills/willharyckman1921.html">will</a> in August 1750. It left his real and personal property to his living siblings. "Harm Ryckman" was buried from the Albany Dutch church on November 11, 1755.
