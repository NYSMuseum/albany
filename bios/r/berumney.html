<P>Spelled and referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Benjamin Rumney</strong></a> lived in Albany during the second half of the eighteenth century. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to <a href="../../res/origins.html">Albany</a>. However, he may have been a son of the first <a href="jonrumney.html">Jonathan</a> and <a href="../vc/jovc.html">Johanna</a> of Albany or the son of one of their children.

<p>From 1744 thru 1759, six children were <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2009-01/1231718976">christened</a> to Benjamin and Maria "Rumley" at the church in New Brunswick, New Jersey. One of the boys was baptized "Jonathan."

<p>In June 1745, his name appeared in the <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc10442.htm">accounts</a> of an Albany area merchant.
<p>In 1766 and '67, the house and property of Benjamin "Rumney/Romley in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> modestly. At that time, his house and lot in the West <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> also received a similar valuation. In May of 1767, "Ben Rumley" was identified as a private in a Rensselarswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In 1770, the pew at the Dutch church, formerly "owned" by the then deceased Bata <a href="../q/woq2325.html">Quackenbush</a>, was transferred to "Benjamen Romblye." 

<p>After that, the name of Benjamin Rumney has not been found during our sweeps of community-based records or of Intenet-based resources. With so many outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> still unresolved, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
