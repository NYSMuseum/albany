<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Wilhelmus Ryckman</strong></a> was born in June 1699 and christened at the church in New York. He was the first son <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/r_sh.html">born</a> to future Albany residents <a href="piryckman1983.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../k/coketeltas.html">Cornelia Keteltas</a> Ryckman.
 
<p>About 1720, he married Albany native Anna Wyngaert at the Schenectady Dutch church. By the time their second child was born in 1723, they were living in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> as the rest of their large family were baptized at the Schenectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>

<p>Although he appears to have been a resident of Schenectady, at least six of his children <a href="ryckman.html#several">lived</a> their adult lives in Albany. In 1747, he was mentioned in his father's will [<a href="../../wills/willpiryckman1983.html">?</a>] and was cut off with only six shillings as an inheritance.
 
<p>This Wilhelmus Ryckman was dead by 1750 when his widow was mentioned in the papers associated with the will noted above.
