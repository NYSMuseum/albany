<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Radcliff</strong></a> was born in October 1765. He was the son of John Jr. and Margarita Passage <a href="rad.html">Radcliff</a>. He grew up a middle child in a moderate sized Albany-<a href="../../albanycounty.html">area</a> family. He seems to have been the only man named Nicholas in the <a href="../../criteria.html">rel</a>evant Radcliff family group. He was known under a number of <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iant spellings of his surname.

<p>Probably during the late 1780s, he married <a href="../g/cagibson.html">Catherine Gibson</a>. Some of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch</a> (1800) and <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran churches</a>.

<p>In 1786 and '87, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">accounts</a> were paid from the city treasury.

<p>In December 1794, he was identified as one of the city watchmen - continuing a tradition of <a href="../../corporation.html#retainers">service</a> that began a century earlier with the Albany family <a href="joradcliff1060.html">patriarch</a> and <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">matriarch</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#1140">1800</a>, his household consisted of three young children, Radcliff, and his wife. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, nine young people joined the parents in this Radcliff household. Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=%22radcliff+nicholas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22radcliff%20nicholas%22&f=false">1813</a>, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> gave his address as 6 Union Street. As late as 1830, the directory listed him at the same address. However, none of the listings specified any occupation. 

<p>Sixty-five in 1830, Nicholas Radcliff probably <a href="../../dead.html">died</a> sometime thereafter. We seek information on his later life and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.</p>
