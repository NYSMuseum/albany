<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Charlotte Roff</strong></a> probably was born during the 1740s. She probably was the sister of the German-ancestry baker <a href="joroff1026.html">John Roff</a> who settled in Albany during the 1760s.

<P>"Charlotta Phaff" married <a href="wmregal1502.html">William Regal</a> in December 1765 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At this point, no children appear in the available records of Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. The couple do not seem to have been known at any of the local churches. 

<p>These Regals made their <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">home</a> near the <a href="../../im/im1770.html">barracks</a> in the second ward. William seems to have been a baker. However, he was dead by <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1501">1779</a> when the "Charlotte Regal's" house and lot were listed on the tax list. 

<p>References to Charlotte Roff Regal have not been found in the <a href="../../cbr.html">comm</a>unity-based record after 1779.

<p>Her husband had died intestate. In February 1781, "John Raff" was empowered to administer his estate. Census documents show that she was <a href="../../census1790.html#1026">not</a> living with the Roffs.

<p>We seek <a href="../qqqq.html">information</a> regarding her background, later life, and passing.</p>
