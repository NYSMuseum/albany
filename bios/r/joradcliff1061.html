<strong>Johannes Radcliff</strong></a> (aka "Johannes Radliff, Jr.") was born in August 1694. He was the son of <a href="joradcliff1060.html">John</a> and <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html">Rachel Van Valkenburgh</a> Radcliff. He grew up in a modest Southside home where his mother frequently was <a href="../../census1697.html#175">left</a> to manage their demanding household. 


<p>In March 1717, he married former soldier's daughter <a href="../y/ceyates4410.html">Celia Yates</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1730, seven children had been christened in Albany where he was a frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>His home was located on a lot west of Pearl and south of Beaver Street - probably at the foot of <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> where his father owned additional acreage. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1061">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1061">1742</a>, his name appeared on lists of freeholders in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the first ward in 1729. Following both parents, he served as bellman and was paid by the city a number of times for performing services.
  


<p>Johannes lost his wife in 1741. Perhaps his home was configured on a <a href="../../census1756.html#191">census</a> of householders taken in June 1756. If so, at that time he was known as a "carrman." Johannes Radcliff died in January 1757 and was buried from his church.</p>
