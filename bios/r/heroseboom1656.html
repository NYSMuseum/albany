<strong>Hendrick Roseboom</strong></a> was born in August 1689. He was the first son born to the marriage of <a href="joroseboom1671.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../c/gecoster.html">Gerritje Coster</a> Roseboom.  He grew up as part of a large family in the home of a prominent fur trader in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. He was among the five children named as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1737. He sometimes was known as "Hendrick Jo. Roseboom."

<p>In October 1724, he was thirty-five when he married a younger <a href="../c/elscuyler522.html">Elsie Cuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1738, five children had been christened in Albany.

<p>The couple raised their family on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> near other Rosebooms and Cuylers. Hendrick J. was included among the second ward freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1656">1742</a>.

<p>Additional qualitative information on the life of Albany resident "Hendrick Roseboom" exists for this time period. At this point, we <a href="../../inprog.html">resist</a> assigning <a href="../bioindex.html#roseboom">non-specific</a> information on "Hendrick Roseboom."

<p>Hendrick J. Roseboom died in October 1754 at the age of sixty-five. His <a href="joroseboom1929.html">survivors</a> lived in their family <a href="../../census1756.html#8">home</a> for many years.</p>
