<strong>David Van Horne</strong></a> (sometimes called David Van Horne, Jr.) <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=mila2&id=I01230">seems</a> to have been born in 1744 or 1755. Perhaps he was the only surviving son of David and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cFIOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA13&lpg=PA13&dq=%22david+van+horne%22&source=bl&ots=aA5_-RBRq4&sig=p5agtIu0ha3v2D1jvMq5GCA4q5A&hl=en&ei=LFodSqWOEYisM8L32JwP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8">Ann French</a> Van Horne of New York who filed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cUEGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA324&lpg=PA324&dq=%22david+van+horne%22&source=bl&ots=vUZ5Z0AarX&sig=b42DNX5USBbSFWr_Ag0nW4hhqcU&hl=en&ei=MlkdSpqmKIPOMteftMUF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8">will</a> in June 1774. His seven <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=AHN&db=mila2&id=I04860">sisters</a> all married within the upper ranks of New York society. 

<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3X8FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA46&lpg=PA46&dq=%22david+van+horne%22&source=bl&ots=_ch23Z2THc&sig=F4MCAwDLnChnooruD8iZSc73AaQ&hl=en&ei=630dSsiRLoukNYrngcMF&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#PPA46,M1">counted</a> among those who emerged as leaders of the opposition to the British.

<p>A "David Van Horne" was an officer in the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">army</a>. Van Horne of New York was a captain in a Continental regiment.  He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=david+lee's&printsec=frontcover&source#PPA556,M1">retired</a> April 23, 1779. Perhaps more than one David Van Horne served. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of "David Van Horne" (one white man, two females, a slave, and a free person of color) was configured on the census for the town of Brooklyn - the only DVH so identified in New York State.
 
<p>His wife was <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=mila2&id=I01231">Sarah Van Blarcom</a>. The marriage produced four children but only daughter "Augusta" was alive in 1801. Curiously, Albany resident <a href="../m/chmiller.html">Christopher Miller</a> was <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA438&dq=horne+albany&lr=#PPA438,M1">said</a> to have been his father-in-law. 

<p>In 1793, he was one of the <a href="http://www.nysoclib.org/trustees/index.html">trustees</a> of the New York Society Library.

<p>By the end of the century, he had taken up residence in Albany. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> was valued on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6423">1800</a>, his third ward household included only an aged man and woman, a slightly younger woman, and a slave.

<p>In January 1801, he was replaced as adjutant general because he had been <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=icI1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA553&lpg=PA553&dq=%22david+van+horne%22&source=bl&ots=jRC6-5nSHY&sig=YMNMcPq7fGgrj9-xkwiqUJplag8&hl=en&ei=WFsdStPBHZ-yMM6euZ4P&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8#PPA553,M1">incapacitated</a> with a paralytic condition. 
<p>David Van Horne filed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA438&dq=horne+albany&lr=#PPA438,M1">will</a> in January 1801. It passed probate on May 18.
