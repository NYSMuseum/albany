<strong>Casper Van Hoesen</strong></a> probably was born before 1680. He was the son of <a href="juvh6053.html">Jurrian Janse</a> and Catharina Hallenbeck Van Hoesen. He grew up in an Albany trader-tradesman's home and at Claverack where the Van Hoesens had a farm.

<p>In January 1701, Casper married <a href="../s/rasling.html">Rachel Slingerland</a> in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1719, seven children had been christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1698">1698</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Later, he would serve as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and juror. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#750">1699</a>, he swore and oath of allegiance to the king of England.  In 1702 and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#750">1709</a>, his first ward home was accorded moderate assessments. In 1715, he petitioned the council for a lot next to his house.

<p>In 1715, he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. 

<p>In 1720, he is said to have been living in Coxsackie. Casper Van Hoesen was last heard from in April 1731 when he paid for the grave of his former militia commander, Captain <a href="../m/jtmingael6193.html">John Mingael</a>.</p>
