<strong>Maria Van Hoesen</strong></a> probably was born about 1720. She may have been the daughter of any of a number of <a href="vh.html">Van Hoesen</a> families living in the Albany area.

<p>In March 1742, she married innkeeper's son <a href="../w/thwilliams6326.html">Thomas Williams, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1753, three children had been christened at the church where she had witnessed a number of baptisms.

<p>This Williams family also was in the hospitality business although Maria's husband served a year as sheriff and was known at <a href="../../furtrade.html#peace">trading</a> posts far into the Indian country. Their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home and inn were early Albany landmarks.

<p>Thomas Williams, Jr. filed a <a href="../../wills/willthwilliams6326.html">will</a> in July 1771. Maria was named executor and principal heir during her widowhood. Widow Maria Van Hoesen Williams was alive in January 1775 when her land in Albany was referenced in a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transaction.</p>
