<strong>Hendrick Van Hoesen</strong></a> was born in November 1748. He was the son of <a href="hevh772.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vd/cavdb1707.html">Catharina Vandenbergh</a> Van Hoesen. His father is <a href="../../wills/willwyvdb5872.html">said</a> to have died shortly after Hendrick's birth. We seek information on his childhood home life although his widowed mother would share a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home with her unmarried <a href="../vd/vovdb5857.html">sister</a> for the next <a href="../../census1790.html#vdbsis">fifty years</a>.

<p>Perhaps this Hendrick Van Hoesen was a member of a <a href="../../na/khook.html">K<a>inderhook-based <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company in 1767. However, he was living in Albany (possibly at least part time with his mother) in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a> when he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Two years later, his was called as a witness in an election <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA2496&lpg#PPA254,M1">eligibility dispute</a> and  stated that he came to Albany from the country late in the afternoon but that the polls were not open. Thus, he had missed his chance to vote. 

<p>In October 1773, he married Albany native <a href="../e/elevertsen7981.html">Elizabeth Evertsen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1785, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5737">1779</a>, his second ward lot was valued on the assessment roll. At different times during the 1780s, his account was paid from the city treasury. 

<p>In 1787, he began the process that led to a lease for land at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a>. After that, his name dropped from the community-based resources thus far encountered. Beyond that, his name does not seem to have been  included on the statewide Federal census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. 

<p>We seek further information on the life of Hendrick Van Hoesen and his family.</p>
