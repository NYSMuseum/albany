<strong>Jurrian Janse Van Hoesen</strong></a> probably was born during early 1640s. He was the eldest surviving son born to <a href="jfvh776.html">Jan Franse</a> and Volkie Van Hoesen. They all <a href="../../nnd.html">emigrated</a> to New Netherland about 1645. They may have immediately taken up residence in the vicinity of <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>. They later settled near Claverack where Jan Franse is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have died in 1667.

<p>By the mid-1650s, Jurrian Janse was appearing before the <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">Beverwyck court</a>. He was identified in the records as a glazier and as the renter of a house. He also was involved in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>.

<p>Jurrian Janse married Catharina Caspers Hallenbeck. The marriage produced at least two sons.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6053">1679</a>, his name appeared on a census of Albany householders. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">1684</a>, he owed back taxes. In 1687, his name appeared on a list of Albany merchants. In <a href="../../census1697.html#041">1697</a>, his home was configured on the Albany census.

<p>Although Jan France had been dead for a half century, letters of administration on his estate were not issued to Jurrian until 1703. After that, his name no longer appeared on albany rolls.

<p>Jurrian Janse Van Hoesen appears to have died at Claverack about 1711.</p>
