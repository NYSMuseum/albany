      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit G. Lansing</strong></a> was born 
        in July 1719. He was the eldest of three sons born to Albany residents 
        <a href="geglansing3700.html">Gerrit Jr.</a> and <a href="../vd/envdu5523.html">Engletie 
        Van Deusen</a> Lansing. He grew up in a small family in a businessman's 
        home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. 
      <p>In December 1744, he married Albany native <a href="../y/anyates4403.html">Anna 
        Yates</a>. She died after two children and about 1750, he wed Wyntie Vandenbergh. 
        By 1760, that marriage added three more children - all of whom were christened 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
      <p>This Gerrit Lansing was a <a href="../../census1756.html#65">carpenter</a> 
        who lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1748, 
        he also was identified as a <a href="../../makers.html#wood">cooper</a> 
        when he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willbevvechten.html">will</a> 
        of his friend, Benjamin Van Vechten. Gerrit was a qualified voter whose 
        property was accorded substantial <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a> 
        during the mid-1760s. 
      <p>His name was found on city government accounts. In 1757, he was paid 
        for repairing the <a href="../../fireengine.html">fire engine</a>. 
      <p>After the 1760s, the name of Gerrit G. Lansing, the middle-aged Albany <a href="../../trades/wood.html">wood</a>worker, dropped from 
        Albany rolls. We must table this sketch as the existence of other same-named 
        individuals raises many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.</p>
