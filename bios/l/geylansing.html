Gerrit Yates Lansing</a></strong> was born in August 1783. He was the eldest surviving son of Albany mainliners <a href="abglansing3695.html">Abraham G.</a> and <a href="../y/susyates4437.html">Susanna Yates</a> Lansing. He grew up in a very large family in the second and third ward <a href="../../census1800.html#3695">homes</a> of a prominent office holder and civil servant. His large and nearby extended family included grandfather <a href="../y/ayjr.html">Ab</a>raham Yates, Jr. and uncle <a href="jolansing3755.html">Jo</a>hn Lansing Jr.

<p>He was enrolled at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_College#History">Union College</a>, pursued classical studies, and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tSEbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA460&lpg=PA460&dq=union+college+%22gerrit+y+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=aKNFq4SDjV&sig=FvyDbyBY0kT-nwKnQrDaYKGvifE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1PEBT_OSOOLe0QGOsY2OAg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=union%20college%20%22gerrit%20y%20lansing%22&f=false">graduated</a> from Union in 1800. Admitted to the bar in 1804, he opened a <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a> practice in Albany. Previously, he is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been the personal secretary to future governor <a href="morlewis.html">Morgan Lewis</a>. 

<p>He served as a legislative clerk and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">pro</a>bate court judge. In 1829, he was selected to the New York State <a href="http://www.regents.nysed.gov/about/history-nysed.html">Board of Regents</a>, served as chancellor in 1842, and remained on the board until he died. 

<p>In 1831, he was elected to represent an Albany district in the United States Congress. Re-elected twice, he served until 1837 and then declined to run again. He later served as an officer of a number of Albany-based corporate enterprises.

<p>In March 1808, he married Albany native <a href="../t/lete4817.html">Lena Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced at least four children. Helena died in 1838.

<p>Over more than five decades, Gerrit Y. Lansing was among the city's more prominent personages. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22lansing+gerrit%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22lansing%20gerrit%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was listed as a counsellor in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> with a residence at 18 Columbia Street and his office at 92 Market Street. He later <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZM4NAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=%22lansing,+hon+g+y%22&source=bl&ots=t4Z6q7eux4&sig=fm5qQTCM5caFC4W0K0HATxktcQQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WrMQT5H-O6bg0QHN9rWuDA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22lansing%2C%20hon%20g%20y%22&f=false">lived</a> on North Pearl Street.

<p>In 1828, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fTUbAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA3-PA8&dq=gerrit+y+lansing&hl=en&ei=55wRT6qEBKTx0gHnk_nDAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=book-thumbnail&resnum=2&ved=0CD8Q6wEwAQ#v=onepage&q=gerrit%20y%20lansing&f=false">testified</a> that he was living in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> and claimed $200 in "damages" from the proposed building of a road through his property.   
 
<p>Gerrit Yates Lansing died in January 1862. He had lived almost eighty years. He was buried with his wife. Their <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7640742">monument</a> can be seen today at the <a href="../../dead.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.

<p>Gerrit Yates Lansing is best known historically for the manuscripts and documents collections that bear his name. <a name=sources></a>He left a number of papers collections in several repositories that are central to core <a href="../../guide/intro.html">initiatives</a> of the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i>.
