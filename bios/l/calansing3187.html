<P>Catharina was almost twenty-eight years old when she married her cousin, merchant <a href="ablansing3064.html">Abraham Lansing</a>, at the Schenectady Dutch church in 1746. This "spinster" was several years older than most early <a href="../../marriages.html">Albany brides</a> but fourteen years younger than her widower husband. However, their four children were baptized in the Albany Dutch church before Abraham's death in 1759.</P>

          <p>Widowed at forty-one, she married Albany widower <a href="../d/abdouw2052.html">Abraham 
            Douw</a> in 1761. Their combination family, now living in Douw's <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
            Street</a> home, included children from both previous marriages.</p>


<p>Abraham Douw died at the end of 1787 - but not before providing for Catharina in his will. She continued to <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3187">live</a> in their home (as her son had become <a href="../../census1790.html#3694">head</a> of that household) until her death in February 1798 at age seventy-nine. Her son, <a href="ablansing3694.html">Abraham A. Lansing</a>, had her buried from the Albany Dutch church.</p>
