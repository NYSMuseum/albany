<strong>Gerrit Lansing</strong></a> was born in August of 1693. He was the son of Gerrit G. and Catharina Sanders Glen Lansing. He was called Gerrit G. Lansing, Jr. to prevent confusion with his father, <a href="gelansing3706.html">son</a>, and a number of other Gerrit Lansings who lived in greater Albany County over the years of his long lifetime.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In October 1718, he married <a href="../vd/envdu5523.html">Engeltie Van Deusen</a> of Rensselaerswyck at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1726, three sons had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Lansings made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. This Gerrit Lansing was a businessman who <a href="../../org/cc.html#1726">served</a> in city government as firemaster, <a href="../../org/cc.html#1727">assistant</a>, and then <a href="../../org/cc.html#1741">alderman</a> for many years. He also performed contract work for the Albany government.

<p>Gerrit G. Lansing, Jr. lost his wife in 1745. He is said to have died at the age of ninety in about 1783. We seek more information on his life after 1750.</p>
