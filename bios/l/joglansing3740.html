<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes G. Lansing</b></a> was born in March 1695. He was the eldest son of Gerrit and Catharina Glen Lansing. He grew up in a large Albany family whose head was a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> and trader. However, Gerrit Lansing died in 1708 when the boy was only thirteen.</p>


<p>Johannes G. Lansing was thirty-one-years-old when he married <a href="../h/cahun4787.html">Catharina Hun</a> in December 1726. She died following the birth of their first child in September 1727. In May 1729, he married thirty-one-year-old <a href="../vv/javvechten2526.html">Jannetie Van Vechten</a> - the mother of four Lansing children, the last one being born when Johannes was forty-two.</p>

<p>He served as a first ward constable in 1719 and as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the second ward in 1729. In 1730, he purchased a lot on the Plain on which he still owed the Albany government money three years later. In 1742, he was identifed as a freeholder living in the first ward.</p>
