<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Lansing</strong></a> was christened <a href="http://www.altlaw.com/edball/dutchbap.htm#1697">in</a> New York in March of 1697. She was the daughter of the union of widower and baker's son <a href="gelansing3461.html">Gerrit Lansing</a> and the widow Catharina <a href="../g/glen.html">Glen</a> "Van Ditmers" Lansing. She grew up as a middle child in the large (possibly combined) family of an Albany businessman who lived in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">S</a>chenectady and New York City as well.

<p>In October 1716, Anna, married the considerably older <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck native <a href="../e/jaegmont7919.html">Jacob Egmont</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1732, ten children had been christened in Albany.

<p>This Egmont family made its home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> of Albany from where Jacob served as city bellman.

<p>However, the marriage was cut short by Jacob Egmont's death in 1734 just before the birth of their last child. Burial <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/chbur_af.html">records</a> also show that at least four of their children had died before 1750.

<p>After that, we have only <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding the fate of Anna and her surviving offspring. Perhaps, they moved in with the Lansings. 

<p>The widow Anna Lansing Egmont was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#deathinfo">buried</a> by her brother <a href="evlansing3245.html">Evert</a> in February 1760.</p>
