<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Jeremiah Lansing</strong></a> was born in April 1754. He was the son of <a href="pelansing3642.html">Peter</a> and <a href="../w/elwendell2857.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> Lansing. He was raised in a merchant's <a href="../../census1756.html#250">house</a> in the <a href="../../im/imecourt.html">heart</a> of Albany's downtown business district.

<p>His entry into business was delayed by the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> as he reached his twenty-first birthday. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek information</a>   on the extent of his wartime service - although he does <a href="http://www.fold3.com/image/424811/">seem</a> to have been involved some with operations of the Loan Office.  Later, he was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany County militia.

<p>In March of <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3438">1779</a>, his personal property was assessed under the first ward house of his father. A <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3438">decade later</a>, his house and property were valued separately.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1779">1779</a>, he entered the Albany mainstream when he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the first ward. He later served as an election inspector. In 1793, he was elected alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1798, he was elected to represent Albany in the New York State Assembly.
  
<p>In October 1780, he married the younger Albany native <a href="../w/helwendell2684.html">Helena Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a lifelong member. By 1800, five children had been christened there.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dIY3AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=%22jeremiah+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=wDei2kibXu&sig=iwnZPx6gk3amB4NOshXSml75kQk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gJy0UabDJ6WTiQLvtYC4Dg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=%22jeremiah%20lansing%22&f=false">1789</a>, he "sold" the farm of 125 acres he had acquired from the <a href="../vr/svr3.html">patroon</a> a year earlier that was located in the East Manor along the Wynantskill [Creek].  

<p>These Lansings <a href="../../census1790.html#3438">lived</a> for a time on <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">Market Street</a>. However, by <a href="../../census1800.html#3438">1800</a>, they had relocated to a comfortable home on North Pearl Street.

<p>In June 1812, he was identified as "my dear friend" and named as executor of the <a href="../../wills/willmgttbroeck68.html">will</a> of <a href="../t/mgttbroeck68.html">Margaret Ten Broeck</a> of "the Colonie."
 
<p>Jeremiah Lansing died in October 1817 at the age of sixty-three. He was <a href="../../dead.html#park">buried</a> in the church plot of the Washington Park cemetery. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">Letters</a> of administration were issued on his estate in November. His widow, Helena, lived at what became their 80 North Pearl Street address until her passing in October 1829.
