<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Lansing</b></a> was born in December 1755. She was the daughter of Albany mainstays Jacob J. and Maria Egberts Lansing.</p>


<p>In May 1779, she married <a href="../w/hunwood.html">Dr. Hunloke Woodruff</a>, a surgeon in the Revolutionary army. Sometimes known as "Polly," her wedding was characterized as "very  private softly and [of an] unexpected manner." Before long, she was raising a family in Albany. By 1799, eight of their children had been baptized in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. </p>

<p>These Woodruffs were Pearl Street <a href="../../homes.html#ewpearl">mainstays</a> and their large home was attended by <a href="../../census1790.html#second">servants</a>.</p>

<p>In November 1810, Mary Woodruff was named primary beneficiary in her husband's will "as long as she remains my widow." Consumed by tuberculosis, Hunloke Woodruff died the following summer. She was not listed among the Albany householders in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> published in 1813.</p>
