<strong>Helena Low</strong></a> probably was born about 1760. She was the daughter of Manhattan merchant and whig-turned-tory <a href="http://www.famousamericans.net/isaaclow/">Isaac Low</a> and his wife, Albany native <a href="../c/mgtcuyler592.html">Margarita Cuyler</a> Low. Her mother was the daughter and sister of one-time mayors of Albany. She probably joined Low family members in Albany while her father was branded a traitor and finally quit New York for England where he died in 1791. She was sometime known as "Lysie" or "Lena."

<p>In July 1781, she married Albany native <a href="../h/dihansen4970.html">Dirck Hansen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1796, the marriage had produced at least five children.

<p>With her husband recently retired as an officer in the Continental army, these Hansens set up their home in the Greenbush part of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. During the 1780s, he held a share of the license for the cross-river <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, their Rensselaerswyck home was served by eight slaves. 

<p>Dirck Hansen made his will in June 1799. It named Helena as his heir to real and personal property. He died a couple months later. Afterwards, Helena <a href="../../inprog.html">married</a> the Reverend Linn.

<p>Helena Low Hansen was seventy-nine in 1837 when she applied for a widow's <a href="../../inprog.html">pension</a> based on her first husband's wartime service. She died sometime thereafter.</p>
