<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rutger Lansing</strong></a> was born in March 1722. He was the second of three sons of <a href="geglansing3700.html">Gerrit G.</a> and <a href="../vd/envdu5523.html">Engeltie Van Deusen</a> Lansing. He grew up with a smallish family in the third ward home of a businessman and city official. His mother died in 1745 but his father lived much longer. Named for a Van Deusen <a href="http://www.newyorkhistoryblog.com/2011/11/shirley-dunn-early-dutch-house.html">patriarch</a>, perhaps, he was the only "Rutger Lansing" living in the region during his lifetime.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1747">1747</a>, he was named constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.  

<p>In October 1764, he married <a href="../vs/suvschoon.html">Susanna Van Schoonhoven</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At the time of their marriage, the partners both were identified as single people of Albany County. The marriage is said to have produced but one child born in 1765. Rutger was an occasional baptism sponsor there before and after his marriage.

<p>These Lansings made their home north of Albany, beyond the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>, at the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. In <a href="../../sources.html#uny">1766</a>, his Halfmoon property was assessed moderately and was located near the holdings of his father and other kin whose mills were taxed nearby.

<p>In his fifties at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, Rutger Lansing supported the crusade for American liberties on the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">homefront</a>. In February 1776, he was among the Albany area residents who signed the <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html#3664">General Association</a>. he previously had signed an oath of secrecy before being elected as a <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> member from Halfmoon. He appears to have served over the life of that wartime body. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href=http://archive.org/stream/newyorkrevolution01statrich#page/234/mode/2up"">land bounty right</a> as an enlisted man under the Twelfth Regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>.

<p>Family-based  <a href="lansing.html#sources">resources</a> reveal that his father died in 1783 and that Rutger succeeded to ownership of the family mill at today's Cohoes. Additionally, his son, Gerrit, is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have lived to raise a family - all beyond the boundaries of the city of Albany.  

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#3664">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. At that time, his family of six was served by seven slaves. No subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">surveys</a> thus far encountered addressed his household or holdings.
   
<p>Rutger Lansing probably died in 1797 as letters of administration were issued on his estate in October. </p>
