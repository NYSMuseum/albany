<strong>Jannetje Lansing</strong></a> was born in January 1747. She was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="gelansing3703.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../b/arbeekman3881.html">Ariaantie Beekman</a> Lansing. She grew up in a small family in the first ward but lost her father when Gerrit Lansing died in October 1748. Her mother did not re-marry but could count on her son who helped her maintain their family home.  

<p>In May 1767, Jannetje was only twenty when she married a somewhat older <a href="../vw/wmvwie8568.html">Willem Van Wie</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A few months later, the first of their six children was christened in Albany.

<p>This Van Wie family made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> near <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3881">that</a> of her widowed mother. For almost fifty years, her husband was known as a carpenter.

<p>Willem Van Wie died in 1816. After that, Jannetje probably lived out her days in family households as her name did not appear on Albany rolls.  Jannetje Lansing Van Wie died  in July 1821 and was buried from her church. She had lived seventy-six years.
