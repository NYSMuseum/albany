<strong>John Ja. Lansing</strong></a> was born in December 1715. He was the son of <a href="jalansing3477.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../g/heglen4922.html">Lena Glen</a> Lansing. <a href="lansing.html#name">Fo</a>rtunately, he mostly was known as "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Jo</a>hannes Jacobse Lansing." He grew up an older son in the <a href="http://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/lansing/jacobgerritlansing.htm">large family</a> of a prominent <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> silversmith and businessman.

<p><a href="#img"><img src="../../images/jpg/jolansing3744.jpg" width=200 height=255 align=left vspace=4 hspace=4 border=2 alt="John J. Lansing at age 90"></a>This individual appears to have <a href="../../marriages.html">m</a>arried three times. In August 1741, he wed Rachel Lieverse (LIevens) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. That marriage may not have produced any children before she died the following May. In October 1744, he married <a href="../vs/cavschaick4011.html">Catharina Van Schaick</a>. A year later, their son, Goosen, was christened in Albany and died a few weeks afterwards. Second wife Catharina died in August 1745.  In December 1747, he married Schenectady native <a href="../s/caschuyler1246.html">Catharina Schuyler</a>. From 1748 to 1759, their marriage produced at least five children. Johannes's third marriage would last for fifty years. He was a lifelong member and supporter of the Dutch church .

<p>Like too many others, this John Lansing <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yTveN16gs2wC&pg=PA406&lpg=PA406&dq=%22john+jacob+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=pZBE5Yyczr&sig=MVktAXV7W6c8dYC0mXngK5y8b7E&hl=en&ei=kaGySYPYH4OftwfkksjEBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result">lived<a/> in eighteenth century Albany. This individual set up his home on the west side of </a></a><a/><a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market Street</a>  - four doors north of Maiden Lane. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a> and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1740">1740</a>, he was appointed constable for the third ward. In 1758 and 1751, he was appointed third ward firemaster. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1752">1752</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the third ward.

<p>John Ja. Lansing was a <a href="../../econ/comec.html">merchant</a> who took <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#3744">part</a> in a number of community-based initiatives to protect Albany's interest in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3744">1763</a>, he was one of two "John J. Lansings" named on a list of Albany freeholders. Beginning during the 1760s - and over three decades, he was re-imbursed for services from the city treasury.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#314">1756</a>, his name may have been included on a census of Albany householders made by the British army. Beginning during the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a> and continuing into the next century, his third ward <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3744">residence</a>, additional properties, and personal holdings were <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3744">valued</a> on city assessment rolls. He owned a number of lots in the second ward (Barrack and Lion Streets). Earlier, he was involved in petitions for <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lands</a> beyond Albany.

<p>In January 1764, he was identified as "Esq." when he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BlQOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=%22lansingh+esq.%22web&ots=4SnAY-0mzf&sig=ujgJ4__mW_JuGQYjp1jCZw9CKE0#PPA200,M1">commissioned</a> a captain in the Albany battalion of the provincial militia.

<p>Almost sixty years old at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, he would not be expected to have played an active part in the fighting. However, this Albany mainliner did contribute financially, take <a href="../../doc/petvd1779.html">part</a> in community-based activities, and also performed services for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a>.

<p>His recently widowed <a href="lelansing3462.html">daughter</a> lived with him for a time during the 1780s. However, by <a href="../../census1790.html#3744">1790</a>, Lena had re-married, her family was gone to Schenectady, and her aging parents' household was configured on the census.

<p>Catherine Schuyler Lansing died in March 1797 at the age of seventy-three. In <a href="../../census1800.html#3744">1800</a>, his household consisted only of a couple of young adults, himself, and three slaves. John Ja. Lansing died in April 1808. He was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yTveN16gs2wC&pg=PA406&lpg=PA406&dq=%22john+jacob+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=pZBE5Yyczr&sig=MVktAXV7W6c8dYC0mXngK5y8b7E&hl=en&ei=kaGySYPYH4OftwfkksjEBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result">remembered</a> by the Schuyler family historian who also mentioned the existence of a portrait of him. This extremely long-lived Albanian had lived for more than ninety-two years.
