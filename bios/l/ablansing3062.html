<P><a href="#sources"><b>Abraham Lansing</b></a> was born about 1663. He was the son of baker and farmer <a href="geglansing3698.html">Gerrit G. Lansing</a> and his wife, Elsie Van Den Uythoff Lansing.</p>


<p>In November 1703, he was about forty-years-old when he married a much younger <a href="../vt/magvtricht6601.html">Magdalena Van Tricht</a> at her mother's Albany house. By 1728, nine children had been christened at that Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member. His <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible23.htm">bible</a> contains family information spanning more than a century.</p>

<p>Even before his marriage, Abraham was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#116">householder</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3062">1699</a>, he signed an oath swearing allegiance to the king of England. Community <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a> taxed his second ward property modestly. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3062">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3062">1742</a>, he was counted among the freeholders of the second ward. In 1715, he was identified as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. For almost a half century, his home on the corner of <a href="../../streets.html#steuben">Steuben</a> and Chapel was an Albany landmark. He also held lots along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.</p>


<p>Abraham G. Lansing died in June 1745 and was buried from the Albany church.</p>
