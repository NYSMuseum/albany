<P>Future Albany leader <A  href="#sources"><B>Philip Livingston</B></A> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in July 1686. He was the fourth child and second son born to the marriage of <a href="rlivingston94.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../s/alschuyler95.html">Alida Schuyler</a> Van Rensselaer Livingston. He grew up learning the intricacies of business, trade, and the marriage of opportunity and public service from the most successful entrepreneur in the Hudson Valley. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/phlivingston150.jpg" width=200 height=269 border=2 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Philip Livingston"></a> From an early age, Philip Livingston acted as his father's assistant, deputy, and then surrogate. By the time he reached adulthood, the pupil was well on his way to becoming a master himself.</p>

<p>In 1708, he married <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8628.html">Catharina Van Brugh</a> - the nineteen-year-old daughter and only heir of a former mayor of Albany. The new couple set up housekeeping in 
              Albany at the <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm Tree Corner</a>. Like their father, the <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8628.html#family">twelve Livingston children</a> were born in that landmark home. From there, they would go forth to further elevate the family name and enhance its status throughout the province and beyond.</P>

      <p>After Robert and Alida Livingston <a href="#relocated">relocated</a> to Livingston 
        Manor, Philip took over his father's Albany enterprises. He also succeeded 
        to the key positions of city and county clerk and Secretary to the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners 
        of Indian Affairs</a>. As a young man, Philip Livingston <a href="../../trades/sur.html">sur</a>veyed 
        land titles. Although appearing in court for many years previous, in 1719 
        he was licensed to practice <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>. But 
        it was his long-time hold on the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">clerk</a>'s 
        office that connected him to potentially profitable public activities 
        at several levels and placed him first in line to take advantage of business, 
        real estate, and other opportunities. Clerk in practice under his father 
        for many years, Philip Livingston was officially appointed in 1721 and 
        held that position until his death. 
      <p>At the same time, Lvingston expanded his Albany holdings, owned a house in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, held property at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>,          was a partner in other countryside patents, and concealed still other properties with deeds in the names of his children. He also ventured into real estate in Massachusetts under the patronage of childhood cohort <a href="../w/jawendell2696.html">Jacob Wendell</a> - one of the wealthiest men in New England.</p>

      <p>In 1725, he was appointed to the provincial <a href="../s/pischuyler61.html#council">Council</a>. 
        He served on this influential board until his death. As his older brother 
        had died in 1720, Philip became lord of Livingston Manor on the passing 
        of his father in 1728. However, he was entrenched in business and public 
        positions in Albany - preferring to live at the yellow brick house on 
        the Elm Tree Corner while often traveling to New York. Still, he found 
        time to further develop the Livingston estate adding new tenants and establishing 
        the colony's first iron works at Ancrum by the 1740s.</p>
			  
<p>Over a long career, Philip Livingston cemented and even added to the extensive holdings first garnered by his more famous father. Well-schooled in the politics of opportunism, he was able to take advantage of several key positions during a long period of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> to develop the manor and increase the family's real estate holdings. He laid the groundwork for the success of the next generation by sending the sons away for training and his daughters to be married into the most advantaged families in the region.</p>

      <p>Philip Livingston filed a <a href="../../wills/willphlivingston86.html">will</a> 
        in July 1748. At that time, he was in "perfect health" and living in New 
        York. After his wife's passing, his substantial estate was to be parceled 
        out to his nine living children. He died on February 11, 1749. His body 
        was transported upriver for burial on Livingston Manor.</p>
