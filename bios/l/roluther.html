<P>Based on subsequent <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22robert+lowther%22+albany&source=bl&ots=cOmW-FedNO&sig=ci3Ps4RzZBETxSagbAOOjqTWL4Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r6YFVdqXEbe1sQTVqoCYAQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20lowther%22&f=false">info</a>rmation, Albany resident <strong><a href="#sources">Robert Lowther</a> or <a href="../../res/sp.html">Luther</a></strong> was born in <a href="../irish.html">Ireland</a> about 1774. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. A number of Lowther families are at-risk in North America during his lifetime.

<p>Census records for this individual point to a family. However, his name or that of a spouse have not been encountered in the available records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, family-based <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/luther/593/">info</a>rmation noted Lucinda, daughter of Robert Luther and Mercy South, was born in Albany County in November 1810.  

<p>In November <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, two Albany jury lists identified him as a "vitler" (probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victualler">victualler</a>). In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the assessment roll for the first ward valued his house, lot, and holdings modestly. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#rolu">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household was configured on the census. It included three children and a couple aged 26-45. A decade later, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> entry accounted for the aging of those family members. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22lawthor+robert%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=lawthor&f=false">1813</a> and afterwards, city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> identified him as a carpenter with addresses at 49 Fox Street and in the rear of 51 Liberty. 

  
<p>"Robert Lowther" died at "Swart's Ferry" on July 1, 1822. He was 48-years old. A newspaper <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22robert+lowther%22+albany&source=bl&ots=cOmW-FedNO&sig=ci3Ps4RzZBETxSagbAOOjqTWL4Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r6YFVdqXEbe1sQTVqoCYAQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20lowther%22&f=false">obituary stated</a> that "He was returning to his home in Albany from a visit to Sharon, which place he left in apparent good health. He availed himself of the new mode of conveyance which the canal afforded, and is supposed to have died of apoplexy. He was a native of Ireland, whose love of liberty induced him to engage in the cause of his country with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Emmet">Emmet</a> and others."

<p>Past diminishing returns, with significant unanswered questions, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!
