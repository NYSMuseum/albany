              was born in Albany in January 1716. He was the fourth son born to 
              <a href="phlivingston86.html">Philip Livingston</a> and <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8628.html">Catharina 
              Van Brugh</a> Livingston. He grew up in a very <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8628.html#family">large 
              family</a> his father's Albany townhouse on the <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm 
              Tree Corner</a> in Albany and at the family estate called Clermont 
              down in the Hudson Valley.</P>
            <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/phlivyng.jpg" align=right width=200 border=0 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="young Philip Livingston"></a> 
              He graduated from Yale College in 1737. He began a business career 
              in New York City and soon was involved in a number of Manhattan-based 
              civic organizations.</p>
            <p>He was named among the heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willphlivingston86.html">will</a> 
              filed by his father in July 1748. This son was left the house he 
              lived in and his father's store in New York. 
            <P>He married <a href="../t/chtbroeck25.html">Christina Ten Broeck</a> 
              in 1740. The marriage produced three children between 1741 and 1745. 
              The couple resided in Manhattan and had a farm in Brooklyn. However, 
              he maintained an Albany presence and was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant 
              alderman</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
              in 1743, 1744, and 1745. He also added to his Albany real estate 
              holdings with his first ward house still on the city assessment 
              rolls in 1767.</p>
            <p>He was a New York City alderman during the 1750s and a member of 
              the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> for Manhattan 
              from 1759 to 1768. On the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">eve</a> 
              of the Revolution, he was a prominent member of the conservative 
              colonial opposition to new British restrictions and taxes!</p>
            <p><A href="#portrait"><IMG align=left alt="Philip Livingston - the signer" border=1 hspace=6 img src="../../images/jpg/phlivingston.jpg" vspace=4 width=150></a>After 
              serving on a number of New York City-based resistance committees, 
              he was elected to the Continental Congress in 1774. As a delegate 
              to the Second Continental Congress in 1776, he signed the Declaration 
              of Independence.</p>
            <p>Suffering from dropsy, his health declined. In the Spring of 1778, 
              he visited friends in Albany for the last time. Although he took 
              his seat in Congress in May, his condition worsened. Philip Livingston 
              died in York, Pennsylvania on June 12, 1778.</P>
            <p>His name still is legendary in Albany today. Livingston Avenue 
              and <a href="http://www.albany.k12.ny.us/district/Livingston.htm">Philip 
              Livingston Magnet Academy</a> are named for him!</p>

            signed the Declaration of Independence, this <a name="livingston"></a>Philip

            portraits</a>. Several <a href="http://www.colonialhall.com/livingston/livingston.asp">Livingston
