<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled inconsistently, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Robert Lottridge</strong></a> was a resident and <a href="../../census1756.html#220">innkeeper</a> in Albany during the middle decades of the eighteenth century. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. We have not discounted a connection to the <a href="wmlov1045.html">William Loveridge</a> family of greater Albany County. Occasionally, this mainline innkeeper and businessman was referred to as "Richard" Lottridge.

<p>He probably was born during about 1720 and was of English ancestry. He was a member and "staunch supporter" of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>At least by <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/HOPKINS/2008-05/1210223396">1745</a>, he was married to <a href="../h/elhopk.html">Elizabeth Hopkins</a>. At 
        least three of their children were christened at St. Peter's between 1749 
        and 1757. 
      <p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_aQ6AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA279&lpg=PA279&dq=%22robert+lottridge%22+albany&source=bl&ots=pZ7oO5lbxT&sig=B93NY5IndYHgmexO45Eb2my23b8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oLzLVJeQFqLesAT8lYL4CA&ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20lottridge%22%20albany&f=false">1748</a> and during the 1750s, his inn was the site of a number of dinners and meetings 
        for official functions including hosting the <a href="../../albanycongress.html">Albany 
        Congress</a> in 1754. Earlier, he had been involved in business at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> 
        and beyond. During the 1750s, he (or a younger Robert) had <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uNgTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA631&lpg=PA631&dq=%22robert+lottridge%22+albany&source=bl&ots=pv4pG1g9MB&sig=DUaIeSgn8PXyj36HK5BLnaNif_k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=b7nLVKiTKuXIsASshoKYBw&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20lottridge%22%20albany&f=false">Indian business</a> with <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>.
      <p>In July 1758, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> 
        of administration on his estate were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=2T8GAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA434&lpg=PA434&dq=%22robert+lotridge,+albany%22&source=bl&ots=yg4T_Ke0gd&sig=Gw2LiqAlrMHFy2u7sYrufYrgt3Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=x_vMVKbELrDgsATKuoH4BA&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20lotridge%2C%20albany%22&f=false">issued</a> to his neighbor, <a href="../vs/stvsvoort6730.html">Staats Van Santvoort</a>. His widow remarried in 1760. He probably was the father of Albany trader and Patriot <a href="thlottridge414.html">Thomas Lottridge</a>, a loyalist namesake, and other offspring as well.</p>
