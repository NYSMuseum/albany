<strong>Gerardus Lansing</strong></a> was born in September 1723. He was the son of <a href="jolansing3739.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/geerschuyler1729.html">Geertruy Schuyler</a> Lansing.

<p>His first wife was <a href="../w/mawendell3048.html">Maria Wendell</a> - with whom he had at least two children. She died. In August 1778, Gerardus was almost fifty-five when he married widow <a href="../t/mgttbroeck62.html">Margarita Ten Broeck</a> Richard at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. His second marriage appears to have been childless as no children were christened at the Albany church where he was a member and elder.

<p>He was a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#3323">merchant</a> who lived on the high side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> for many years. His comfortable <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3323">home</a> was attended by as many as <a href="../../census1790.html#3323">five slaves</a>. This Albany mainstay was a freeholder, belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>, and participated in many community-based activities.

<p>In 1751, he served as a firemaster and later as assistant alderman. He was actively involved in Albany government activities. During the Revolutionary War, he served on the supply-side <a href="../../or/or-as.html">homefront</a> and was called an Indian interpreter. After the war, he was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3323">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In March 1792, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjorbleecker201.html">will</a> of a Pearl Street neighbor.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#3323">1800</a>, his household was childless but included his wife and three slaves. Gerardus Lansing died in March 1808 at the age of eighty-five. His will passed probate in May.</p>
