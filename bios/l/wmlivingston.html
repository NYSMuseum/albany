        <a href="#sources"><b>William Livingston</b></a> was born in Albany in 
        1723. He was the eighth of the thirteen children born to <a href="phlivingston86.html">Philip 
        Livingston</a> and his wife <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8628.html">Catharina 
        Van Brugh</a> Livingston. He grew up in his father's <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">landmark</a> 
        Albany house and at the family estate called Livingston Manor - which 
        his father inherited in 1728.</p>

      <p>William spent much of his youth in the care of his grandmother, Albany resident 
        <a href="../c/sacuyler609.html">Sara Cuyler Van Brugh</a>. A younger son 
        of one of the wealthiest men in colonial Albany, this young teen also 
        spent a year as a missionary among the Mohawks at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort 
        Hunter</a> under the tutelage of one-time Albany neighbor Reverend <a href="../../bios/b/hebarclay.html">Henry 
        Barclay</a>.</p>

<p>At age thirteen, William followed his brothers to New Haven and graduated from Yale University in 1741. Livingston maintained his Yale connection for many years.</p>

<p>But after graduation, he went home to Albany. A brief commercial apprenticeship ruled out business as a career path. Philip Livingston then chose a legal career for his youngest son. Over the next years, he studied law under eminent Manhattan jurist James Alexander. The clerkship was a failure. Experiencing great difficulty applying himself in the New York City setting, William Livingston again returned home. Sent back to New York to clerk under William Smith, after two years, he was admitted to the New York bar.</p>

      <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/wmlivingstoneng.jpg" width=150 align=right border=0 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="William Livingston during the 1720s"></a>By 
        that time, he had begun to gain some repute as a political essayist. He 
        established a legal practice in New York City. During the 1750s and 60s, 
        he represented Albany's legal interests in New York. In 1745, he married 
        Susannah French and lived on Manhattan.</p>
  

<p>After 1770, he moved his legal practice to New Jersey and built a large home at Elizabeth. He served in the Second Continental Congress, commanded the New Jersey militia, and was elected governor of New Jersey in 1776. He held that office for the remainder of his life.</p>  

<p>William Livingston died at his estate in Elizabethtown, New Jersey in 1790 and was buried there.</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of William Livingston focusing on his childhood 
        and on his relationship with the city of Albany is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 5033. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="rlivingston94.html#sources">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The most outstanding 
        source on his life is Milton M. Klein, <i>The American Whig: William Livingston 
        of New York</i> (New York, 1993), a revised edition of the author's 1954 
        doctoral dissertation. A chapter entitled "The Early Years" provides an 
        unparalleled, personal look at his youth! See pages 31-56. A large number 
        of Internet <a href="http://odur.let.rug.nl/usanew/B/livingst/livingst.htm">biographies</a> 
        present a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/livvyboy/William-Livingston.html">variety</a> 
        of perspectives.</p>
