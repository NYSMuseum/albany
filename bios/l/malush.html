<strong>Mary Lush</strong></a> was born in January 1787. She was the daughter of <a href="stlush416.html">Stephen</a> and <a href="../s/lystringer5049.html">Lydia Stringer</a> Lush. She grew up in a large family in the grand <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market Street</a> home of an Albany newcomer who was closely connected to the post-war government of New York State. Her maternal grandparents lived next door on the other size of the double Lush-Stringer house. 

<p>By 1808, she had married the Reverend <a href="../b/jombradford7407.html">John M. Bradford</a>. By 1819, six children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where her husband served as pastor for twenty years.

<p>These Bradfords raised their children in a home located across the street from those of her kin and were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22bradford+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22bradford%20john%22&f=false">Market Street</a> mainstays for two decades.

<p>By the early 1820s, her husband had become incapacitated and soon would be forced from his pulpit. Her extensive and affluent family network helped her through an otherwise troubling decade.

<p>In April 1825, Mary was named  in the <a href="../../wills/willstlush.html">will</a> filed by her father who died later that month. Her two sons were provided for from her father's substantial estate. 

<p>Reverend John M. Bradford died in March 1826. He had lived only forty-six years. Mary was to live for almost forty more years without him. Her mother survived until 1841. Mary Lush Bradford died in November 1861 at the age of eighty-three.
