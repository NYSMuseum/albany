          <P><B><a href="#blydius">Balthazar (Baltus) Lydius</a></B> was born 
            in Albany in 1740, the youngest son of <A href="jhlydius4615.html">John 
            H.</A> and <A href="../m/gmlydius1473.html">Genevieve Masse</A> Lydius. 
            Unlike his older brother, <A href="martinus.html">Martinus</A>, he 
            grew up in Albany more than at the family trading post at Fort Edward. 
            Also, unlike Martinus, his life was more reticent than active.</P>

          <P>For still unknown reasons, he never married. For much of his adult 
            life, he lived with his charming and able mother. <A href="#ebaltus"><IMG align=right alt="Baltus Lydius - terror of all the boys" border=1 hspace=4 src="../../images/jpg/ebalthus.jpg" vspace=4 width=200></A>Also 
            puzzling is the absence of a service record for him during the last 
            of the colonial wars. Although he lived most of his life in the family 
            home at <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">State and Pearl</a>, 
            he did not assume the family business when his father went to England 
            and never returned.</P>

<P>At age 27, he was listed on the Albany militia rolls, was paid small sums as a contractor of the city, and later served as a <A href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</A> in his home <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a>. During the War for Independence, the only record of any activity came in May 1777 when he was denounced by the Albany Committee as one of the leaders of a suspected conspiracy to attack and destroy the city. However, no further mention of the incident has been uncovered. The next year, he may have been one of a number of Albany people who wrote the governor on behalf of William Rogers, a suspected horse thief. The absence of involvement for a native son of his age and station may point to some physical or emotional deficency.</P>

<P>The end of the war and the death of his mother and brother made middle-aged Baltus Lydius's life more and more reclusive. The first Federal <A href="../../census1790.html#ledius">Census of  1790</A> identified him as the sole occupant of the old Lydius house. A decade later, the <a href="../../census1800.html#4620">census</a> showed a slave living in his house as well. Although appearing on tax assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4620">rolls</a>, his name has not been found in the records of Albany government or in those of the city's businesses and organizations.</P>

<P>However, he was the subject of a surprizing number of anecedotes. Local lore tells us that he lived alone except for a "pale faced, melancholy looking cat," rarely using lights, never let anyone in his home, and was called an <b>"</b>eccentric old bachelor and the terror of all the boys . . . a tall, thin Dutchman with bullet head, fond of his pipe and bottle, gloried in celebacy until [late in life when he] . . . gave a pint of gin for a squaw calling her his wife and lived with her until his death.<b>"</b> Another account referred to Old Mr. Lydius as <b>"</b>. . .something of a lion in his day, unusually tall, raw boned, singular in his habits, eccentric in his character, independent, honest, and gruff as a bear.<b>"</b></P>

          <P>Balthazar Lydius died "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA417&lpg=PA417&dq">suddenly</a>" in November 1815 at age 78. This grandson of 
            a revered <a href="jlydius4614.html">Dutch Reformed minister</a> was 
            buried from <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> Episcopal 
            Church. His obituary noted that he was "a very eccentric character 
            and last male descendant." Short on accomplishments, Balthazar Lydius 
            was remembered by a number of historical chroniclers. One of the cityscapes 
            painted by <A href="../../victorian.html#Eights">James Eights</A> 
            featured the Lydius house and was dated 1814. In an upper window, 
            sat an older man smoking his pipe. The <a href="lydius.html">Lydius 
            family name</a> passed from Albany rolls with his death.</P>
