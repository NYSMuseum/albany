<strong>Pieter Lassing</strong></a> was a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> and businessman who lived in Albany during the second half of the seventeenth century. According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, he was <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/r/y/Janice-E-Bryant/ODT11-0001.html">born</a> about 1635 in Denmark and emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> about 1659.</p>

<p>His wife may have been Catharina Hoffmeyer. Their children were born during the 1680s and perhaps before and after as well.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#76">1679</a>, his name was listed on a census of Albany householders. He may have been a partner (with the <a href="../vs/vschaick.html">Van Schaicks</a>) in an Albany brewery which he sold to his partner's son in 1681. After that, he seems to have left Albany and the name dropped from city rolls until the nineteenth century.

<p>Lassing later lived at what became Poughkeepsie in Dutchess County where his family became prominent.

<p>Pieter Lassing probably died in Dutchess County in February 1709.</p>

<strong>Sources:</strong> 
The life of Pieter Lassing has not yet been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This admittedly premature, baseline  <a href="../../res/bios.html#sketch">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. His surname has been spelled in a variety of ways - most often as "Lossing." He was an ancestor of favorite New York historian, artist, and iconographer <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc19618.htm">Benson John Lossing</a> (1813-91). The Lassing name does not appear to have been connected to the Albany <a href="lansing.html">Lansing</a> family.
