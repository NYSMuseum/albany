<P>German-born <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland &eacute;migr&eacute;<a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Leisler</b></a> (1640-91) took charge of affairs in New York in 1689. 
        He established a government to act in place of the existing provincial 
        structure. Its activities included appointing local officials in Albany. 
        Leisler's regime ended when he was arrested and then executed in 1691.</p>

<p>Led by <a href="../s/pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a>, Albany's established leaders were unmoved by Leisler's claim to <i>de facto</i> power. At that time, a number of Leisler's opponents in Manhattan had taken refuge in Albany among what was considered a majority of kindred spirits. Leisler sought acceptance in Albany and countered by appointing a slate of municipal officers to govern the new city. He also <a href="../../sources.html#sh">commissioned</a> a number of militia officers. Under the pretense of rushing to Albany's defense against an impending French invasion, he sent his brother-in-law, Jacob Milbourne, upriver to foster Albany's compliance. 

<p>Leisler's appointees were: <a href="../w/jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a> as mayor; <a href="../c/jocuyler546.html">Johannes Cuyler</a> - clerk; aldermen - <a href="../b/jobecker6031.html">Johannes Becker, Jr.</a> and <a href="../e/egteunise4500.html">Egbert Teunise</a>. Leisler's appointees were mostly young and aspiring. Some were sons of Albany's more established leaders.</p>

<p>The Leisler-identified government structure occupied city hall while the locally elected "city fathers" met at the fort. The Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a> moved its operations back to city hall immediately after Leisler's fall from power.</p>

      <p>Seeking advancement, German-born Jacob Leisler had <a href="../../newcomers.html">emigrated</a> 
        to New Netherland in 1660. A few years later, he married <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MZurlZfg1fAC&pg=PR14&lpg=PR14&dq=Elsie+Tymens&source=bl&ots=z9qrllRkQz&sig=aUGPbuiRmE358z1Znq8MkEcGU-M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiNhNKboYLYAhVhkeAKHR-dD8gQ6AEISzAJ#v=onepage&q=Elsie%20Tymens&f=false">Elsji Tymens</a>, a widow with several children. Their union may have produced seven offspring including a <a href="frleisler.html">daughter</a> who married a one time Albany resident. Taking advantage of New York connections and opportunities, 
        he found success in business and trade. Although based primarily in Manhattan, 
        in 1676, Leisler spent some time upriver and had appeared before the Albany 
        court concerning the perching of Dominie <a href="../vr/nvr.html">Nicholas 
        Van Rensselaer</a>.</p>

<p>This exposition is <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> a comprehensive biography but intends to provide access to Leisler's <a href="../../res/context.html">connection</a> to Albany in the fifteen years that followed.</p>
