<P><A href="#sources"><B>Hilletie Lansing</B></A> was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland pioneers</a> Gerrit Frederickse and Elizabeth Hendrix Lansing. She was born in Holland before her parents left for America.</P>

      <P>By the mid-1660s, she had married Albany tavernkeeper/trader <a href="../../bios/vd/svdz.html">Storm 
        Vanderzee</a>. The marriage produced several children who established 
        the Vanderzee family with an important <a href="lansing.html">Lansing</a> 
        connection in Albany and in the region.</P>

<p>Vanderzee died in 1679. A joint will left everything to his wife with provision that half the estate be divided among their children when they reached adulthood. At the same time, she stood to inherit a share of her father's estate in Holland.</p>

<p>Within a year, Hilletie had remarried. Her second husband was <a href="../../bios/k/wmketel4652.html">Willem Ketelhuyn</a> - who took over her husband's tavern. As she was still in her twenties, Hilletie gave birth to at least three Ketelhuyn children over the next deade - with two sons being christened "Storm" in honor of her first husband.   </p>

<p>The tavern was located beyond Albany's north gate. In 1697, she is included on the <a href="../../census1697.html#015">city census</a> in the household of her husband.

<p>Hilletie Lansing Vanderzee Ketelhuyn died before March 1715 when Ketelhuyn re-married.</p>
