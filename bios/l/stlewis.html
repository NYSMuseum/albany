<strong>Stewart Lewis</strong></a> was born about 1765. He was the son of Albany tavernkeeper <a href="rolewis.html">Robert Lewis</a>. The widow <a href="silewis1190.html">Sidney Crawford Lewis</a> was his mother or step-mother.

<p>Stewart took over management of the popular <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html#lewis">Lewis's Tavern</a> at the corner of State and South Pearl following the death of his father in 1798.

<p>In June 1804, he married Susan Austin at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal Church. He had been confirmed there in 1791. He had a number of children as shown on subsequent censuses.   

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#stl">1800</a>, he was identified as the head of a large first ward household that included five slaves. Assessment rolls valued his <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> holdings substantially. He also owned lots in the less settled parts of the city.

<p>Beginning in 1813, he was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as an innkeeper at 76 State Street and/or 8 South Pearl Street. By that time, he had become an officer in a number of community-based organizations.

<p>In June 1819, he advertized that his former "City Tavern" located at 76 State would open as a boardinghouse.

<p>Stewart Lewis died in June 1829 and was buried from his residence at 76 State Street. He had lived fifty-four years.</p>
