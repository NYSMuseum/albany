<strong>Jannetje (Janet) Livingston</strong></a> was born in July 1751 and christened in New York City. She was the daughter of <a href="jolivingston5017.html">John</a> and <a href="../t/catbroeck13.html">Catharina Ten Broeck</a> Livingston. Despite strong family ties in Albany and New York, her father established himself as a merchant in Montreal. His family lived in Canada until about 1774 when they returned to New York to work a farm on family property at today's Stillwater.


<p>During the 1770s, she met and married <a href="../vd/javdh5691.html">Jacob Vanderheyden</a> - an Albany merchant who was a decade-and-a-half older. They settled in Albany. By 1789, their family included three children who were baptized in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, Jannetje was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>After <a href="../../census1790.html#5691">passing</a> more than a decade in the third ward, these Vanderheydens moved into a landmark house on North Pearl Street that has become known as the "<a href="../../loc/vdhpalace.html">Vanderheyden Palace</a>."

<p>Jacob Vanderheyden enjoyed success and respect over the balance of his life. He died in September 1820.  Jannetje Livingston Vanderheyden died in December 1823 and was buried from her residence at 85 North Pearl Street.</p>
