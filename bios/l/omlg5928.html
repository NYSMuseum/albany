<P><a href="#sources"><b>Omie La Grange, Jr.</b></a> was born about 1672. He was the third son of <a href="lagrange.html">family</a> patriarch <a href="omlg5927.html">Omie</a> and <a href="../d/andevries7859.html">Anna De Vries</a> La Grange. He grew up in a large family that knew homes in Albany and along the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#nrmskl">Normanskill</a>.</p>


<p>In March 1697, he married <a href="../vkl/elvloon6705.html">Elsie Van Loon</a> - the daughter of a recently arrived Lutheran <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nygreen2/van_loon_family.htm">family</a> that settled in southern Albany County. The marriage may not have produced children.</p>

<p>In June of that year, the household of Omie La Grange, Jr. with only a man and woman in residence was configured on the <a href="../../census1697.html#050">census</a> for the city of Albany.</p>

<p>He may have owned a boat as he was re-imbursed by the province of New York in 1717 for carrying soldiers and freight to Albany. However, that service may have been performed many years earlier!</p>

<p>In 1723, he was named to inherit a share of his father's interest in the family sawmill. By that time, Omie Jr. was paying taxes in Ulster County.</p>

<p>Omie La Grange, Jr. field a will in January 1725. He identified himself as a resident of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> colony. It named his wife, Elsie, and his brothers as heirs. He died later in the month of January. His widow remarried in 1727 and lived until 1742.</p>
