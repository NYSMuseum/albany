<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac G. Lansing</b></a> was born in May 1677. He was the son of Albany pioneers <a href="geglansing3698.html">Gerrit G.</a> and <a href="../vd/elvdu2333.html">Elsie Van Den Uythoff</a> Lansing. He grew up in a baker's house on the hill in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. At age twenty-one, he probably was accounted for in the household of his father on the census of <a href="../../census1697.html#154">1697</a>.</p>

<p>In June 1703, he married <a href="../b/jabeekman3918.html">Jannetje Beekman</a> at her <a href="../b/jombeekman3858.html">father's</a> Albany house. By 1723, the marriage had produced <a href="#child">seven</a> children.</p>

<p>These Lansings raised their family in a <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">modest</a> home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> supported by Isaac's work as a shoemaker. He served as a juror and constable in the first ward. In 1723, he was elected assistant alderman in the ward and <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">served</a> at least four more annual terms through 1731. Isaac was a member of Johannes Schuyler's <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">troop</a> of horse in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#204">1756</a>, his home was one of sixteen Lansing named households appearing on the Albany census. 


<p>
<p>Isaac G. Lansing died in January 1772. His passing had occasioned notice in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> and in the New York papers as he had lived 93 years and seven months.</p>
