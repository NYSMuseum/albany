<strong>Anthony Lispenard</strong></a> was born in Rochelle, France about 1640. He emigrated to New York in 1669. He was among the most prominent <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> residents of early Albany and greater New York.

<p>During the ensuing years, he settled in Albany where he was known as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> and <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a>. Beginning in 1670, he was identified as a licensed baker in Albany. In <a href="../../census1679.html#8081">1679</a>, his house was included on a census of Albany homeowners. In November 1681, his house was partly destroyed by fire and was torn down. He built at least another house in Albany and owned other pieces of property within the <a href="../../map/map1676.html">stockade</a> as well.

<p>During the 1670s and 80s, he appeared regularly before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> on a variety of matters and was an active participant in the Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market. 

<p>He had married Abeltie (Abigail) Forge/Frese about 1671. Their children established the Lispenard family in colonial New York. He was an officer of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> as early as 1680. In 1674, he was among the notables <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html">invited</a> to the funeral of Rensselaerswyck director Jeremias Van Rensselaer.

<p>During the 1680s, he served as a courier between New York and the French. By that time, he seems to have left Albany - perhaps for New York or New Rochelle.

<p>In  January 1689, the Albany government <a href="#com">commissioned</a> him to serve as "Viewer of the Corn." 


<p>Anthony Lispenard first filed a will in Albany in April 1685. He filed a second will in July 1696. He died in New Rochelle later that year. His widow may have survived for several decades.</p>
