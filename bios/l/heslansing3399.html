      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hester Lansing</strong></a> was born in 
        July 1743. She was the daughter of <a href="gelansing3703.html">Gerrit</a> 
        and <a href="../b/arbeekman3881.html">Ariaantie Beekman</a> Lansing. She 
        grew up in a small family whose growth was cut short by the untimely death 
        of her father in 1748. Her mother survived - living with her sons in the 
        <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> for several <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3881">de</a>cades. 
      <p>In January 1763, Hester was not yet twenty when she married <a href="../r/jaroseboom1667.html">Jacob 
        Roseboom, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1783, ten children had been christened in the church where both parents 
        were members, pewholders, and baptism sponsors. 
      <p>This Roseboom family made its <a href="../../census1790.html#1667">home</a> 
        in the third and first wards where Jacob Roseboom, Jr. was a successful 
        merchant, patriot, and community leader who died pre-maturely in April 
        1797 at the age of forty-six.

<p>On a number of occasions before and after Jacob's death, Hester was involved in the buying and selling of Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a>. 
      <p>Widow Hester then took over as head of their household. For the next 
        three decades, the <a href="../../census1800.html#3399">census</a> and 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">other</a> community enumerations 
        showed her living in a modest home at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA85,M1">59 
        Hudson Street</a>. 
      <p>Hester Lansing Roseboom died in November 1826 at the age of eighty-four.</p>
