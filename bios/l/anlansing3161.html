<strong>Anna Lansing</strong></a> was born in October 1750. She was the first child born to <a href="gelansing3706.html">Gerrit Lansing</a> and his second wife, Wyntie Vandenbergh Lansing. She grew up as part of a combined family in a woodworker's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.  

<p>She was barely twenty in January 1769 when she married <a href="../w/cowendell2766.html">Cornelis Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The first of their six children was born that October. The last was christened in January 1785.

<p>This Wendell family made its home in the third ward where Cornelis helped run the family store. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2766">1790</a>, her household was configured on the Albany census. However, by 1800, they no longer were listed on Albany rolls.

<p>Her husband died in 1814. Her fate at that time has not been determined.</p>
