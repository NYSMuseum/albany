<P><a href="#sources"><b>Engeltie Livingston</b></a> was born in July 1698. She was the first child born to of <a href="rlivingstonjr.html">Robert Livingston, Jr.</a> and his wife <a href="../s/mgtschuyler1486.html">Margarita Schuyler</a> - daughter of Albany's first mayor. </p>


<p>Engeltie grew up in a wealthy Albany household and enjoyed the landed affluence of <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Schuyler Flats</a> and Livingston Manor. As the eldest granddaughter of two of Albany's premier families, it could be expected that her husband would be drawn from the New York elite. However, Engeltie was thirty-four years old when she married twenty-six-year-old <a href="../vr/jovr5127.html">John Van Rensselaer</a> in January 1734. The marriage produced six children who were baptized in the Albany Dutch church from 1734 to 1747.</p>

<p>These Van Rensselaers lived at Crailo - a Van Rensselaer country seat located across the Hudson in Greenbush.</p> 

<p>Shy of her fiftieth birthday, Engeltie Livingston Van Rensselaer died in February 1747. Van Rensselaer re-married and lived until 1783.</p>
