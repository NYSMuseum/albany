<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Lennington</strong></a> appears to have been born in 1751. Then he <a href="http://stceolfrid.byethost13.com/Windmuller/#Ensign Thomas Lenington">would have been</a> the son of Thomas Lennington - a descendant of the first Puritan settlers of Long Island.

<p>He <a href="http://www.fort-plank.com/Non_Mohawk_Val_Pens_A_M.html">married</a> Sarah "Sickleton" at "Scotch Plains" in 1775. Their children arrived beginning at least in 1779 and <a href="http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Manhattan/1stPresbyterianBapNYC.html">later</a> (1790s) were christened at the First Presbyterian church in New York City. During the early 1800s, Sarah was a member of the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a> in Albany.

<p>He is said to have signed the Association in Orange County prior to enlisting in the Continental army. His wife is said to have <a href="http://www.fort-plank.com/Non_Mohawk_Val_Pens_A_M.html">lived</a> in New Jersey while Thomas was away.

<p>His name was <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_3d_reg.htm">included</a> as an enlisted man on the roster of the Third Regiment of the New York Line. He served in the expedition against Canada. He was identified as a sergeant and an ensign and was captured by the British on the St. Lawrence River. He was exchanged in December 1776. An <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/10067903/Early-American-Orderly-Books-1748-1817-Author-Index">orderly book</a> from this period (including Albany) is said to have been kept by Ensign Lennington. His heirs later <a href="http://www.fort-plank.com/Non_Mohawk_Val_Pens_A_M.html">applied</a> for a <a href="#ar">service</a> pension.

<p>We seek information on his life during the 1780s and 90s. His name does not seem to have been included on the first Federal Census of <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> anywhere in New York State. [<font size=-1>We seem to have missed something here!</font size>]

<p>But, in <a href="../../census1800.html#thlenn">1800</a>, the households of <a href="../../census1800.html#thlen">two</a> "Thomas Lenningtons" were enumerated on the Albany city census. His son, future Albany attorney Thomas Lennington, would have been too young to have lived separately in 1800.

<p>Thomas Sr. is <a href="http://stceolfrid.byethost13.com/Windmuller/#Ensign Thomas Lenington">said</a> to have held the Federal appointment as collector of the port of Albany from 1806 to 1813. 

<p>In June <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Y48EAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA563&lpg=PA563&dq=%22thomas+lennington%22&source=bl&ots=Zcp0O6REfq&sig=K3i4DXERYc_JPWIiUzVqMf-I_Dk&hl=en&ei=apgbTKn0LYWdlgeR4MjdCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20lennington%22&f=false">1812</a>, he was among those who were elected directors of the Mechanics & Farmers Bank. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22lennington+thomas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22lennington%20thomas%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory fixed his residence at 237 Court Street. The next two directories included his residence on what had become South Market Street and noted that he was the Collector of "U. S. Revenue."

<p> After 1815, he apparently removed to New York City.

<p>Thomas Lennington died in New York in April 1827 (<a href="http://www.fort-plank.com/Non_Mohawk_Val_Pens_A_M.html">or</a> 1829). The notice stated that he was age 80 and formerly of Albany. His widow died in Brooklyn in 1851 at the age of 106.</p>

<p><a name=ar></a><a href="http://secondat.blogspot.com/2010/01/love-peace-and-liberty-condemn-hatred.html">DAR</a> record book information: Thomas Lenington, (1755-1829), served as sergeant under Capt. John Nicholson in the Canadian campaign; was promoted ensign 1776; was taken prisoner and confined fourteen months at Quebec and Halifax. After his exchange he was employed in the quartermaster's department and had command of a vessel on the North River. The widow was one hundred and four years old in 1848 and a pension was allowed her for over two years actual service as sergeant and ensign in the New York line. She was married in New Providence, New Jersey and received her pension in Brooklyn, N. Y.
