      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob H. Lansing</strong></a> probably was <a href="#born">born</a> 
        within a few years of 1680. Perhaps he was the first son born to the marriage 
        of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="hglansing3350.html">Hendrick</a> 
        and Elizabeth Caspers Lansing. His mother died in <a href="../h/hallenbeck.html">1685</a> 
        after giving birth to perhaps five children. His father was a <a href="../../census1697.html#029">prom</a>inent 
        Albany trader who lived until 1709. This individual probably was the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=%22Lansing,+Jacob+%28son+of+Hendrick%29%22&source=bl&ots=I8nw9TD6ID&sig=b_AoIioGg3ct1etZ6KK6yzyWbzw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GV-MVP37C62asQSLloBY&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Lansing%2C%20Jacob%20(son%20of%20Hendrick)%22&f=false">first 
        of many</a> Jacob Lansings to live in colonial Albany. This sketch <a href="../qqqq.html">seeks</a> 
        to differentiate and distinguish this Albany native sometimes known as 
        "Jacob H. Lansing" from the others. 
      <p>He may have been <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#jal1">one</a> of the <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#jal2">two</a> Jacob Lansings who signed a loyalty oath to the King of England in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html">1699</a>. If so, he <a href="../../res/guess.html">prob</a>ably had been born in Albany during the 1670s. However, two <a href="lansing.html#name">same-named</a> adults gives us pause in the assignment of qualitative information.

<p>In October 1701, Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> records note his marriage to Albany native <a href="../p/hepruyn3544.html">Helena Pruyn</a> at her father's house. By 1725, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=%22Lansing,+Jacob+%28son+of+Hendrick%29%22&source=bl&ots=I8nw9TD6ID&sig=b_AoIioGg3ct1etZ6KK6yzyWbzw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GV-MVP37C62asQSLloBY&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Lansing%2C%20Jacob%20(son%20of%20Hendrick)%22&f=false">ten children</a> reflecting the names of both sets of grandparents had been christened at the Albany church.

<p>Known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, this Jacob H. Lansing was an Albany mainstay for the remainder of his life. He served the community, first as high constable in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1704">1704</a> and as an appointed <a href="../../trades/sur.html">sur</a>veyor - also in that year. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">1729</a>, he ascended to the <a href="../../cityfathers.html">leadership</a> position of alderman for the third ward and was <a href="../../org/cc.html#1730">re-elected</a> the next two years.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3720">1709</a>, perhaps it was his property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> was valued on the city assessment roll. His house and property were on Brewer's Street - the predecessor of North <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>.

<p>In <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=WqApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA178&lpg=PA178&dq=%22effie+hansen+vs.+melgaert+v.+d.+poell%22+lansingh&source=bl&ots=3_vEjXWtCQ&sig=8chq7joiMLtB5ap9LpX80N82ELA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Qb-NVJ_CJIbbsASO-YGoAg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22effie%20hansen%20vs.%20melgaert%20v.%20d.%20poell%22%20lansingh&f=false"">May 1703</a>, he was among those juror in a civil suit before the Albany <a href="../../org/mayorct.html">Mayor's Court</a>. 

<p>Perhaps he was the "Jacob Lansingh" listed on the <a href="../../lists/list1715jmc.html#3720">roster</a> of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a> Company in 1715. More substantial involvement with militia activities would have been anticipated.

<p>At this point, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">surmise</a> that he may have been a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> - at least nominally. 

<p>Perhaps he was the Jacob Lansing whose name appeared on a list of freeholders living in the third ward in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3720">1742</a>.


      <p>Perhaps this individual was the "Mr. Lawnson" <a href="../../census1756.html#305">listed</a> 
        as a baker on the inventory of Albany householders taken by the British 
        army in <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>. That home appeared next 
        to that of a descendant of his father-in-law. 
      <p>Church records tell us that Jacob Lansing was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/chburmen.html">buried</a> "near his house" in October 1756. Perhaps "Lena Lansingh" was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/chbur_gp.html">interred</a> the following December.</p>
