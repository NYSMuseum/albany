          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Jacob Loockermans</B></A> came to New Netherland 
            during the mid-seventeenth century. He probably was the brother of 
            Govert and Jan Loockermans originally of Antwerp, Belgium. He married 
            Tryntje Claes and settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. 
            They had a <a href="caloock5934.html">daughter</a> who was born during 
            the 1660s, married <a href="../t/wtbroeck83.html">Wessell Ten Broeck</a> 
            in 1684, and lived in one of her father's Albany houses.</P>

<P>Loockermans was a prominent if not outstanding <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> and landholder during Albany's formative years. In <a href="../../census1679.html#122">1679</a>, he was identified as a mainline Albany householder and assessed as a substantial merchant. During that time, he performed a number of civic chores - serving as juror, roadmaster, and weighmaster. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</P>

<p>By 1686, Jacob and his wife had filed a joint will. Tryntie Jans died before August 21, 1696 when Jacob married Maria De Hooges - the widow of <a href="../b/hebries6332.html">Hendrick Bries</a>. This older couple is listed together on the city <a href="../../census1697.html#108">census of 1697</a>.  The last reference to him are <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#jal">two</a> listings from an Albany assessment <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5936">roll</a> for 1709. With his passing, the Loockermans name disappeared from Albany records.</p>
