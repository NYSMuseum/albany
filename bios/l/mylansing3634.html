<strong>Myndert Lansing</strong></a> was born in January 1722. His parents were <a href="ablansing3062.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../vt/magvtricht6601.html">Magdalena Van Tricht</a> Lansing. He was the youngest son in the large family of a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> mainstay. Both of his parents died in 1745 when Myndert was but twenty-three.

<p>He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=A6vceOAal2oC&pg=PA741&lpg=PA741&dq=myndert+lansing&source=web&ots=ZZ54IRUXCq&sig=OdFbfrAkioS070dkala6mcPeGrg&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result">said</a> to have graduated from Yale College in 1743  - and to have taken a second degree there in 1746. However, those accomplishments have <a href="../../inprog.html">yet</a> to be substantiated.
<p>A number of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=KY19o6w98lgC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=myndert+lansing&source=web&ots=mM0j64VYRb&sig=TRBre7Q0XaoA0VcCJitB7IOgd4A&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result">sources</a> have identified "Myndert Lansing" as a trader in the West Indies in context with members of his immediate family and other merchant<a href="../../econ/comec.html">/</a>importers.
 
<p>But, by August 24, 1754, this Myndert Lansing was deceased as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2T8GAAAAMAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=editions:04N2YCEYfNTUxNcVtUa3zoC#PPA432,M1">issued</a> to his brother, <a href="ablansing3064.html">Abraham Lansing</a> of Albany. At that time, Myndert was a resident of Curacao. He had lived only thirty-two years.
