<P>The name of <a href="#sources"> <strong>Asser Levy</strong></a> appears in the story of New Netherland and in the early history of Albany as well. Since then, his life has taken on 
legendary proportion! This <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland pioneer</a> was in America from the 1650s until his death about 1680. This businessman and butcher lived predominately on Manhattan but was connected by ambition to the early days of other places in the region as well. This offering focuses on his time in and connection to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Bev</a>erwyck/Albany. 

<p>The first American named Asser Levy was a Jew who is said to have born in what is now Poland/Lithuania, emigrated to Brazil, and then to New Amsterdam in 1654. In October 1664, he was among those "Dutch" at New York who <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/documentsrelativ11newy#page/76/mode/2up">swore allegiance</a> to "His Majestie . . . James, Duke of Yorke."

<p>Asser Levy is <a href="http://jbiztechvalley.com/2011/07/1956/">said</a> to have been the first Jew to own land in the colony when he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA388&lpg=PA388&dq=%22asser+levy%22+early+records+of+albany&source=bl&ots=zDgQtXNFjR&sig=30mhjg8I08bUNU2pnzPwp49IBRc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I9wmVPjDEsGdyASD6YDwAw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22asser%20levy%22%20early%20records%20of%20albany&f=false">made the first payment</a> on the house of one <a href="../vb/marjansvb.html">Marcelis Jansen</a> in September 1661. The parcel was well described and stood "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA362&lpg=PA362&dq=%22asser+levy%22&source=bl&ots=zDgQtXNFjR&sig=30mhjg8I08bUNU2pnzPwp49IBRc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I9wmVPjDEsGdyASD6YDwAw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22asser%20levy%22&f=false">on the hill</a>" in the village of Beverwyck. Jansen <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA297&lpg=PA297&dq=%22asser+levy&source=bl&ots=zDgQtXNFjR&sig=30mhjg8I08bUNU2pnzPwp49IBRc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I9wmVPjDEsGdyASD6YDwAw&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22asser%20levy&f=false">certified</a> that Levy had made the final payments on the property on November 1, 1661. The following September, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NZx3gehXILIC&pg=PA308&dq=%22asser+levy%22robert+sanders&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VPonVM64A5D3yQTTk4GICQ&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22asser%20levy%22robert%20sanders&f=false">appears to have sold</a> the property to <a href="../s/rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a>.

<p>This individual appears to have been the subject of additional Albany-relevant references both before and after the transactions described above. However, our <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">comprehension</a> of those activities  is <a href="../../inprog.html">incomplete</a> at this time.

<p>Asser Levy is said to have died between 1680 and early 1683 when his estate was in litigation.

<p><a href="../../res/guess.html">Per</a>haps Asser Levy never spent a night in Beverwyck/Albany. </p>
