      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Francina Leisler</b></a> was born in December 1676. 
        She was the daughter of <a href="leisler.html">Jacob</a> and Elsje Tymens 
        Leisler. Her father's rapid ascendancy in New York society was cut short 
        by the so-called "Leisler's Rebellion," which cost him his life in 1691.</p>
      <p>In November 1694, Francina married <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5XmPJcGDY7oC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=thomas+lewis+leisler+new+york&source=bl&ots=xBOyVtTA0B&sig=gOpCJadfWFUpMr0nwhF6I7wH2Hw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjBxfWtqYLYAhWGk-AKHawcCu4Q6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&q=thomas%20lewis%20leisler%20new%20york&f=false">Th</a>omas Lewis in New York City. This 
        Lewis family lived in New York. After several children, he died - leaving 
        her full use of his estate during her widowhood. However, before long, 
        she married widower <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html">Joachim Staats</a> 
        - an Albany native who, by that time, was based in New York as well. Perhaps that union produced a daughter (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pf_GBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=francina+leisler&source=bl&ots=H4LI3nw9MN&sig=jfEB0PrdiUMssiB_t4DEczSV8b4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwigl6ig_f_XAhUHRCYKHSspD9gQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&q=francina%20leisler&f=false">ch</a>ristened in Albany in 1712). The marriage ended with Staats's death also in 1712.</p>

<p>Widowed again, she lived the remainder of her life near her family in New York City.</p>

<p>Stating that she was sick, Francina Leisler Lewis Staats filed a <a href="../../wills/willfrleisler.html">will</a> 
        in August 1728. She probably died later that year. After years of dormancy and dispute, her will finally cleared probate on August 31, 1765.</p>
