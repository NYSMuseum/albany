<strong>Isaac G. Lansing</strong></a> was born in November 1740. He was the first of four children born to the marriage of <a href="gelansing3703.html">Gerrit I.</a> and <a href="../b/arbeekman3881.html">Ariaantie Beekman</a> Lansing. His father died in 1748 and his mother did not re-marry. However, she maintained their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home into the <a href="../../census1790.html#3881">1790s</a>.

<p>This Isaac Lansing does not seem to have married and thus lived under his widowed mother's <a href="../../census1756.html#170">umbrella</a> for the next forty years. He was identified as part of his mother's household on a number of occasions. At the same time, his personal property was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3473">evaluated</a> on city assessments.

<p>During the 1760s, he probably was one of the "Isaac Lansings" listed on the rosters of Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> companies. In his thirties during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, we seek information on his wartime activities. However, afterwards he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3473">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. Perhaps, he was the "Isaac G. Lansing" who was a <a href="http://morrisonspensions.org/hiltonderick.html">lieutenant</a> in that <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">regiment</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1777">1777</a> and again in 1782, he was appointed chimney viewer in the first ward. In 1788, he was named fireman. During the 1770s and 80s, various payments were made to "Isaac Lansing" by community-based organizations.

<p>Isaac G. Lansing died in July 1791 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. At this point, we must resist collapsing abundant information on simply "Isaac Lansing" into this biography. </p>
