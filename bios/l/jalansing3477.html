<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob G. Lansing</b></a> was born in June 1681. He was the son of Albany baker <a href="geglansing3698.html">Gerrit Lansing</a> and his wife <a href="../vd/elvdu2333.html">Elsje Van Den Uythoff</a> Lansing. He grew up as part of a large family on the hill <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">behind</a> what became State Street. </p>


<p>Just past his thirtieth birthday, he married an only slightly younger <a href="../g/heglen4922.html">Helena Glen</a> in October 1711 - a few days following the birth of their first child. By 1725, he was forty-four when the last of their nine children was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>These Lansings lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in a house Jacob built about the time of his marriage. That building stood on the site until 1882. He was a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a> of some <a href="../../inprog.html">reknown</a> and also was known as a merchant. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3477">1720</a>, his name appeared on a freeholder's list for Albany's first ward.</p>

<p>Jacob G. Lansing may have lost his wife as early as 1725. He is said to have died in December 1767 at the age of eighty-six years and six months. However, we cannot reconcile community-based information of Jacob Lansing with so many same-named individuals at risk during the second and third quarters of the eighteenth century.

<p>He was succeeded by his nephew and protege, <a href="jalansing3726.html">Jacob G. Lansing</a> - who married the elder Jacob G. Lansing's daughter in 1774.</p>
