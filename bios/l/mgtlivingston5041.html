<strong>Margarita Livingston</strong></a> was born in October 1742. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="jolivingston5017.html">John</a> and <a href="../t/catbroeck13.html">Catharina Ten Broeck</a> Livingston. She grew up in a large and mobile family that lived in New York, Montreal, Albany, and at places in-between!

<p>In July 1779, she was middle-aged when she married fellow Canadian <a href="../../or/or-nw.html#liv">refugee</a> <a href="../c/edchinn.html">Edward Chinn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she had been christened almost thirty-seven years earlier. This late marriage produced no children.

<p>After living briefly in Albany, the couple settled permanently in Claverack where the aged Chinn was a prominent <a href="../../census1790.html">resident</a>.

<p>Margarita Livingston Chinn lost her husband in 1802. After that she was listed in Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> as a widow living at 26 <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a>. She also controlled additional real property in Albany. She died in November 1820 at the age of seventy-eight. She was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Episcopal church cemetery. Her remains later were relocated to the Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
