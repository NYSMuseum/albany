<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ann Logan</strong></a> is <a href="#res">thought</a> to have been born in Ireland in 1739 and to have been of Scottish <a href="../irish.html">ancestry</a>. We seek information regarding her family and early life. 
      <p>In 1757, Ann would have been about eighteen when she married a much older 
        <a href="../b/joboyd7399.html">John Boyd</a> in Antrim, Ireland. The marriage 
        produced a daughter and as many as eight sons. The first three children 
        were born in Ireland while the others were christened in Albany. None 
        of her children appear to have been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. Her husband, however, was a pillar of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. 
      <p>According to traditional sources, Ann's sister had married her husband's 
        business partner in Europe and had emigrated to North America about the 
        same time as the Boyds. 
      <p>Boyd was a merchant who <a href="../../friends.html">survived</a> the Revolutionary era to re-emerge in 
        post-war Albany with a large extended family. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7399">1790</a>, 
        their third ward household included three males over 16, fifty-one-year-old 
        Ann, three boys, and two slaves 
      <p>About 1793, Boyd is said to have relocated his family to Johnstown where 
        he built a sawmill and died there in 1799. 
      <p>In May 1797, Ann Boyd posted an administrative <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">bond</a> 
        for her brother, James Logan - a Lake Champlain farmer. 
      <p>After John Boyd's death, widow Ann moved back to Albany and into the 
        South Pearl Street <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22m'hench+peter%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22m'hench%20peter%22&f=false">home</a> 
        of her married daughter. 
      <p>Ann Logan Boyd died in Albany in February 1815. She was interred with 
        her husband in the cemetery in Johnstown. </p>

We seek substantiation of her Logan family background. We have <a href="../../inprog.html">yet</a> to definitively connect the Albany families to the Logans or Boyds of Northern Ireland.
