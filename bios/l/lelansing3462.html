<strong>Lena Lansing</strong></a> was born in November 1750. She was the only daughter in the smallish family of <a href="jolansing3744.html">Johannes Ja. Lansing</a> and his third wife, <a href="../s/caschuyler1246.html">Catharina Schuyler</a> Lansing. She grew up in the <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">landmark</a> home of a prominent <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> merchant.

<p>In January 1776, she married <a href="../z/jozab6985.html">John Zabriskie</a> of Hackensack at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their son was christened there in 1779. Daughters were born in November 1776 and in 1782 but were absent from Albany baptism rolls.  
Zabriskie died in April 1782 - just past his twenty-eight birthday and two months after the birth of their last child.

<p>Her small family continued to live in the Albany home of her aging father - as they did when Zabriskie was alive. 

<p>In November 1787, the thirty-seven-year-old Lena married the recently widowed (and somewhat older) former Revolutionary war officer, Abraham Oothout at the Schenectady Dutch church. She then re-located to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> - thus joining two families of children. In 1794, Oothout petitioned and was appointed <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DLuVfPFPVOIC&pg=PA417&lpg=PA417&dq=oothout+schenectady&source=web&ots=J-Au92wPLb&sig=K6-VzOsosBqti5pgDcto-bOpsxg&hl=en&ei=T9maSZrHA9KgtwexmailCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result">guardian</a> of the remaining two Zabriskie children. Oothout died about 1811.

<p>Lena Lansing Zabriskie Oothout died in Schenectady in April 1826. Her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in Albany. Her son, <a href="../z/jolzab.html">Johannes</a>, became a noted cleric.
