<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John A. Lansing</strong></a> was born in November 1749. He was a middle child in the large family of <a href="ablansing3692.html">Abraham Ja.</a> and <a href="../c/elcooper477.html">Elizabeth Cooper</a> Lansing. By the 1770s, his parents had relocated to the "New City" called <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> where Abraham Jacobse was a founding father. However, this subject was <a href="lansing.html#name">known</a> as John A. Lansing and appears to have remained in Albany where he would be a mainline resident for the rest of his life. 

<p>His involvement in civic affairs may have begun in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1772">1772</a>, he was elected constable for the third ward. He also was selected as "High Constable."

<p>In his mid-twenties at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, 
        John A. Lansing was an active supporter of the American cause. In <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n179/mode/2up">July 
        1775</a>, he was among those sent to Ticonderoga by the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany 
        Committee</a> and paid to work as carpenters. In <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n285/mode/2up">October</a>, 
        he was appointed battalion quartermaster for the Fourth or Rensselaerswyck 
        regiment. The <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n347/mode/2up">February</a> 
        following, he was paid &pound;10 17s from the Committee treasury. His 
        service may have been of <a href="http://www.fort-plank.com/Gansevoort_Military_Papers_Calendar.pdf">longer</a> 
        duration. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3754">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. In 1836, 
        his widow would seek <a href="#pension">pension</a> relief based on his 
        wartime service. 
      <p>In February 1776, he married <a href="../f/elfryer8094.html">Elizabeth Fryer</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, 
        the partners were identified as "<a href="../../criteria.html">of</a> 
        this city." By 1790, nine <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=%22lansing,+johannes+a%22&source=bl&ots=-_t5F4H_8t&sig=3UEDtQYQyOQOrlg81V2k5bn7lXw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UZS-VLivJfOxsATtm4LADw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22lansing%2C%20johannes%20a%22&f=false">children</a> 
        had been christened at the church where they were members and pewholders.
		. 
      <p>John A. Lansing was among a number of family members who engaged in baking. Not surprisingly, he married the daughter of a recently deceased Albany <a href="../f/wmfryer8035.html">baker</a>. Like the Fryers, this couple made their home on what became South <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">Pearl Street</a>.
 

<p>His father appears to have died in 1780 as Elizabeth Cooper Lansing was a widow when she filed her <a href="../../wills/willelcooper477.html">will</a> in September. <a href="../qqqq.html">Cur</a>iously, son John A.(then about 31) was not among those children listed as heirs. 

<p>However, this Albany native appears to have been a lifelong city resident. Beginning in October <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, property under John A. Lansing was valued on Albany assessment rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3754">1788</a> and also in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his real and personal property was taxed moderately.

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA323&lpg=PA323&dq&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22false">1781</a>, he was allowed six skipples of wheat from municipal supplies. A month later, he was to receive four pounds presumably for services. In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA267&lpg=PA267&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false">1786</a>, the council ordered that a new well be made between his and Robert Hilton's houses in the first ward.

<p>Like his father and brothers, John A. was a member of an Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#3754">Masonic Lodge</a>. Perhaps these Lansings belonged to the Union Lodge as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lY1YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=%22john+a+lansingh%22&source=bl&ots=uSUJnMMZyR&sig=LInXwSsQDs7kotDBuamc-d1DFwA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YOjEVNvjMMzjsAS26YGIDg&ved=0CC8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20a%20lansingh%22&f=false">early as 1773</a>.

<p>During the <a href="../../org/cc.html#1791">1790</a>s, he served as a fireman in the first ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1798">1798</a>, he was the first ward fire inspector.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#3754">1800</a> (but perhaps not in <a href="#config">1790</a>), the household of "John Lansing" included four children and the parents and was configured on the census for the first ward. The census in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> charted the growth of that family.


<p>In 1813, the first city directory <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22john+a%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22john%20a%22&f=false">listed</a> John A. Lansing as a baker at 33 Washington Street. Over the next decade, he was listed at that address (later 33 South Pearl) on the corner of Hudson.
 
<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=%22john+a+lansing+died%22&source=bl&ots=cOmSYEdeRR&sig=kgJZ24sT_b1CqdK1VrEkexYvt14&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Zd_DVP6bKoT2yQSZ9YHgCg&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20a%20lansing%20died%22&f=false">Lauded</a> as "a patriot of the Revolution," John A. Lansing died at the end of January 1825. He had lived 76 years. His <a href="https://familysearch.org/photos/stories/2665932">will</a> (written in 1806) passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in February 1828. "Widow Elizabeth Lansing" still <a href="../../sources.html#ad">resided</a> at 33 South Pearl into the 1830s. </p>

<p><a name=config><b>1790</b>: The household of John A. Lansing does not seem to be among the nineteen Lansing-named households listed on the city census in 1790. Several possibilities exist for inclusion in a nearby household. But, with a <a href="../f/elfryer8094.html">wife</a> and a number of living children to shelter, this omission is <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzling</a>!
