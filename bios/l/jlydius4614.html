          <P><a href="#biography"><b>Johannes Lydius</b></a> was born in Maesden, South 
            Holland, the eldest son of Reverend Hendricus Lydius. Following his 
            father's profession, he entered the ministry. By 1692 he had become 
            domine of the Reformed Church of Antwerp, Belgium. During that time, 
            he married <a href="../r/irlydius4613.html">Isabella Rachels</a> 
            and the couple began a family. However, his tenure in Belgium proved 
            stormy. By 1700, a deteriorated relationship with the Antwerp congregation 
            led him to accept a call to become minister of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> in Albany.</p>

<p>The Lydiuses sailed to America - arriving at New York in July 1700. By late September, they had taken up residence and he had been installed as the minister in Albany. Over the next decade, the Lydius family continued to grow with the addition of three American-born children. Johannes Lydius's Albany career was characterized by dedication and diligence. This pious and scholarly man served well - endearing himself to a growing congregation, the <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city fathers</a>, and to the royal government of New York which compensated him for instructing the Mohawks.</p>

          <p>As the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany hinterland</a> became more 
            settled and developed, Domine Lydius struggled to minister to a more 
            diffused and more americanized flock. Concerned about the erosion 
            of traditional Dutch piety, he has been credited with publishing an 
            instructional catechism. Taking charge of church business, he expressed 
            concern about the condition of the <a href="../../im/im1686.html">old 
            blockhouse church</a> and for the church pasture lands on the city's 
            southern flats.</p>

          <p>The minister's status and his dependable service made his family 
            welcome across Albany society. They were given what became a landmark 
            house on the corner of <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">State 
            and Pearl Streets</a> and he also owned a share of an Albany brewery. 
            He was a thoughful cleric and called "friend" by many contemporaries. 
            His <a href="../a/jabeel124.html#anniversary">birthday poem</a> for 
            Mayor <a href="../a/jabeel124.html">Johannes Abeel</a> provides a 
            sterling example of his good will.</p>

          <p>Still only middle-aged, Domine Lydius became ill in 1709. His <a href="../../wills/willjlydius4614.html">will</a>, 
            dated September 17, noted that he was "sick in body." But he was able 
            to provide for Isabella, his "beloved spouse" and principal heir, 
            and for their five living <a href="lydiusfm.html">children</a>. He 
            died in Albany on March 1, 1710.</p>

          <p>Johannes Lydius was mourned by his congregation, memorialized by 
            Mohawk diplomats, and eulogized by several contemporaries including 
            Anglican Reverend <a href="../b/tbarclay.html">Thomas Barclay</a>. 
            This Dutch minister was the founder of the <a href="lydius.html">Lydius 
            family</a> in America!</p>
