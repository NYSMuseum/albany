<P><a href="#sources"><b>Abraham G. Lansing</b></a> was born in December 1756. He was the son of <a href="gejalansing3705.html">Gerrit</a> and his second wife, <a href="../w/jawaters465.html">Jannetje Waters</a> Lansing. He grew up a younger child in the large combined Market Street family of a well-known merchant and gunsmith. He was the brother of Chancellor <a href="jolansing3755.html">John Lansing</a>. To prevent confusion with similarly named kin, he was consistently <a href="lansing.html#name">kn</a>own as "Abraham G. Lansing."</p>

<p><a href="#rr"><img src="../../images/jpg/abglansing3695.jpg" align=left border=2 hspace=5 vspace=1 alt="Abraham G. Lansing as State Treasurer" width=200 height=262></a>Abraham came of age during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>. He served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and was appointed firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1776">1776</a>. But like his older brother, his clerical abilities would make him more useful in office work. Throughout the war years, he appears to have been involved in the payment of accounts for  New York State. Afterwards, he was among those who were accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3695">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment.</p> 


<p>After announcing marriage plans to Catharina Van Deusen in August 1778, instead he wed Albany native <a href="../y/susyates4437.html">Susanna Yates</a> at the <a href="../../na/sgtke.html#church">Schaghticoke</a> Dutch church in 1779. She was the daughter of Patriot leader <a href="../y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> Their thirteen <a href="#fam">children</a> were born between 1780 and 1808 and baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>Over the next two decades, Abraham was closely associated with his prominent father-in-law - serving as Yates's <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RI1MAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22abraham+g+lansing%22+3171&source=bl&ots=MFXEIkjWRV&sig=WgZmqon2BRCvnrTiRI-YNGkKdD8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw0ofNi6fVAhXKHD4KHaOgCkgQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20g%20lansing%22%203171&f=false">deputy</a> in the Loan Office in 1780 and most likely in the <a href="../../org/po.html">Post Office</a> as well. During the 1780s, he was in regular correspondence with Yates. Lansing's large and growing family <a href="../../census1790.html#1">lived</a> with the Yateses until Abraham's death in 1796. After the war, he entered business and was able to acquire investment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3695">property</a> in and beyond Albany.</p>
<p>During the machinations surrounding the writing and adoption of the United States <a href="#const">Const</a>itution, Abraham G. Lansing was the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-DvolFMBVRgC&pg=PA537&lpg=PA537&dq=%22abraham+g+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=Ggb42jZAVo&sig=lzdzNb--F3CbFujkG3ExjYw89hI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirsLC9nonWAhUB2yYKHXgyA8o4ChDoAQg2MAQ#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20g%20lansing%22&f=false">correspondent</a> of his antifederalist father-in-law while also being solicited to help sway the thoughts of his delegate older <a href="jolansing3755.html">brother</a>. Although not infrequently sought out by both sides (and referenced by now several generations of "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22abraham+g+lansing%22+ratification&oq=%22abraham+g+lansing%22+ratification&gs_l=psy-ab.3...119438.125282.0.126318.15.15.0.0.0.0.215.1927.0j12j2.14.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..1.10.1358...35i39k1j33i160k1j33i21k1.h2jy1TPAXHc">ratification</a>" scholars), we are unable to offer anything definitive regarding his own feelings on the subject. 


<p>However, this subject was primarily an officeholder and public servant. Abraham G. Lansing served as Albany County Surrogate (1787-1808), <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LD8QAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22abraham+g.+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=6TEZ9B7sDT&sig=3tYH90MUgZ3141fpOg7JmUZP8vY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi7krz8qafVAhVBGz4KHSyRC9cQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20g.%20lansing%22&f=false">Treasurer</a>    of New York State (1803-12), and as a trustee and board member of a number 
        of community-based organizations. He served on the New York State Board 
        of Regents and as the private secretary to Governor <a href="morlewis.html">Morgan 
        Lewis</a> as well. </p> 

<p>Abraham G. Lansing was a prominent Albany personage of the early nineteenth century - inheriting the large new house built at what became 358 <a href="../../streets.html#market">North Market Street</a> following the death of his father-in-law in 1796. However, the census for <a href="../../census1800.html#3695">1800</a>, configured his residence in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</A>.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22lansing+abraham g%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22lansing%20abraham g%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed the fifty-seven-year-old mainliner as a resident of 94 Market Street. At that time, his was one of nineteen Lansing-named households in the city. At least thru <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1820</a>, he resided at that main <a href="../../streets.html#market">street</a> address.

<p>A contemporary characterized him as <a href="#rr">"</a>a man of sound sense and vigorous tone of mind; rough and somewhat abrupt in his manner, but upright, frank, and fearless in conduct and in character.<a href="#rr">"</a> He died in September 1834. His <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/8800/005114106_00244?pid=733401">will</a> passed probate a month later. His remains are <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=139728298">said to be</a> at <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>. </p>
