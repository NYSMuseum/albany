<P> <a href="#sources"><strong>John Lottridge</strong></a> was born prior to 1740. He probably was the eldest son of newcomer Albany innkeepers <a href="rlottridge453.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../h/elhopk.html">Elizabeth Hopkins</a> Lottridge. His father died in 1758. His mother remarried in 1759 and continued management of the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> landmark for a number of years.

      <p>John Lottridge served during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a> 
        as a lieutenant in <a href="../m/edmatthews683.html">Edmund Matthews</a>' 
        militia company. He is said to have been at Lake George in September 1755 
        when the fort was attacked by the French. He then volunteered for the 
        "Indian Service" and saw action at a number of frontier locations. Over 
        the winter of 1759-60, he was on duty at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. 
        He then took part in the capture of Montreal and served there and as a 
        trader in the Great Lakes region until the fall of 1763 when he left for 
        Lake Champlain. In October of that year, he was reported "lost" while 
        exploring the wilderness around the Bay of Missisquoi. 
      <p>During those years, he appears to have been a frontier representative of his Albany family and involved in Indian diplomacy under <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a>. His accounts with Johnson and other Johnson associates point to trading beyond the Indian service. In August 1761, Johnson referred to him as "Captain" and as the brother of <a href="thlottridge414.html">Thomas Lottridge</a>.

<p>Perhaps this individual did not marry as no family <a href="../../churches.html">information</a> has been encountered for him.  



<p>Frontier operative John Lottridge died sometime in 1763. In January 1764, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued to his brother Thomas as John had died intestate. Thomas Lottridge spent several years trying to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BlQOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA323&lpg=PA323&dq=%22john+lottridge%22&source=bl&ots=4UpE0Y2rCc&sig=h4ifruf2xVKUPlOeJD-DWcwXWsg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=46ENVeDcEuXksATH6IGADQ&ved=0CEYQ6AEwCg#v=onepage&q=%22john%20lottridge%22&f=false">settle</a> his dead brother's accounts.</p>
