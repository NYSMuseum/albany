<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Lottridge</strong></a> was born about 1742. He probably was the son or kinsman of Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#220">innkeeper</a> Robert (or Richard) <a href="rlottridge453.html">Lottridge</a>, who died about 1758 leaving a number of children. If so, <a href="../h/elhopk.html">Elizabeth Hopkins</a> Lottridge O'Connor would have been his mother.

<p>By 1764, Thomas was making his way as a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> 
        in the Indian country and was known as the brother of deceased trader 
        <a href="jolottridge.html">John Lottridge</a> at trading posts from <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> 
        to Detroit. He also was referred to as "Lieutenant" Lottridge. 
      <p>In July 1766, he married Albany native and ferryman's daughter <a href="../b/mabradt4268.html">Maria 
        Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href"../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1786, six 
        children had been christened in Albany churches. He was a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> while Maria belonged to the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where most of their children were baptized. 
      <p>A few months earlier, he had joined a number of Albany men who <a href="../../solconst.html#414">signed 
        a document</a> in protest of the Stamp Act. His Albany property was valued 
        in 1766. He also belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. 
      <p>In 1770, he was licensed to run the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> 
        from Albany to Greenbush in partnership with <a href="../t/catbroeck14.html">Widow 
        Hansen</a>. By 1771, his family was living at the ferry. Operating the 
        ferry seems to have been a lucrative enterprise as in 1780 the annual 
        rent charged to Lottridge and Widow Hansen was 660 pounds. He seems to 
        have retained the license until 1784 or after. In 1782, he was granted 
        permission to put a house on the ferry property. By that time, the ferry 
        license was held jointly with the widow's son, retired officer <a href="../h/dihansen4970.html">Dirck 
        Hansen</a>. In 1786, he was asked to settle his accounts relating to the 
        ferry. After that, he was committed to jail for debt. 
      <p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he was among those who sought 
        damages against Albany merchants who were charging more than allowed. 
        A year later, he was charged with carrying gunpowder into hostile territory. 
        His handling of the ferry also was placed under closer scrutiny as he 
        seems to have attracted the attention of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a>. However, afterwards he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land 
        bounty right</a> for service to the American cause. 
      <p>Perhaps his household was configured in <a href="../../na/hoos.html">Hoosick</a> 
        on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. 
      <p>His <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#414">name</a> (one of three 
        Lottridges) appeared on a list of creditors of the estate of Albany butcher 
        <a href="../c/wmcharles7590.html">William Charles</a> in 1793. 
<p>Thomas Lottridge died in prison in December 1802 after being confined for fifteen years. He was said to have been about sixty.

<p>His passing was reported in a number of local and regional newspapers. 
        <a href="#obit">One noted</a> that "During the whole period of his confinement, 
        he was in the most abject poverty; though when committed to prison, he 
        was in possession of considerable property; and it is said, offered his 
        creditor undoubted security to pay his whole debt, on condition of being 
        discharged from arrest, which was refused."
