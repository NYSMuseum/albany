<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrickie Lansing </strong></a> was born in October 1748. She was the oldest daughter in the family of <a href="islansing3470.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../vw/anvwoert2408.html">Anna Van Woert</a> Lansing. She <a href="../../res/sp.html">appears</a> also to have been <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/Hendrikje_VanWoert_Lansing_records.ashx?pid=43073666">ref</a>erenced as "Hendrickje Van Woert Lansing." Her father was a shoemaker who owned a house in the third ward.

<p>In August 1771, she married the somewhat older <a href="../f/abfonda3778.html">Abraham D. Fonda</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, the partners were identified as unmarried residents of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">colony</a>. By 1781, six children had been christened in Albany where the parents were occasional baptism sponsors. By 1786, two additional children were <a href="http://www.eancestry.org/familygroup.php?familyID=F4606&tree=nichols">baptized</a> by the parents in the Dutch church at the Boght.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, Abraham D. Fonda was an officer in the Albany militia. His family does not seem to have lived separately in Albany during the war years. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on her wartime situation. Subsequently, these Fondas <a href="../../census1790.html#af">raised</a> their family in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>Abraham D. Fonda died in 1799. From then onward, the aging Hendrickie was not identified as a head of household and probably resided in a home of one of her three surviving children or with other kin. 

<p>However, this Watervliet widow was particularly long-lived. In March 1837, Hendrickie deposed that she was eighty-eight years old and a resident of Watervliet when she filed a <a href="../../or/pension/penabfonda3778.html">pension</a> application based on her husband's wartime service. Although not able to recall many of the details of his service, she was awarded a monthly stipend and a large payment of pension money due in arrears.

<p>Hendrickie Lansing Fonda is said to have died in February 1840. </p>
