<P>According to subsequent resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Solomon Lockwood</strong></a> was born about 1744. A <a href="http://www.lockwoodfamily.com/robert803.pdf">number</a> of same-named individuals seem to be at risk during this Albany resident's lifetime.


<p>In February 1788, Solomon Lockwood married <a href="../b/cabeasley.html">Catherine Beasley</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. In September 1791, he was confirmed in St. Peter's. By that time, a son and a daughter had been christened there as well.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#solloc">1788</a>, his personal property was among that assessed at the end of the enumeration for the second ward. In <a href="../../census1790.html#solloc">1790</a>, his childless household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot were valued modestly on the first ward assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#soloc">1800</a>, his family was counted in the first ward as well. However, the only adult male listed in the household was born after 1755.

<p>During the late 1790s, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=23JKAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=%22solomon+lockwood%22+albany&source=bl&ots=CCBuGawxIj&sig=4dhDvw7YEPwkEx0sVuAnzogNA6M&hl=en&ei=6K4PTIG6AYH78Aa7w7mhCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20lockwood%22%20albany&f=false">seems</a> to have been a tenant of <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer</a> as well.
<p>However, by 1813, a number of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22lockwood%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22lockwood%22&f=false">Lockwoods</a> were listed in the first city directory. None of them was named Solomon.

<p>In 1817, Solomon Lockwood was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rn0_AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22solomon+lockwood%22+ballston&source=bl&ots=43L2fUuguw&sig=iUVRgL-ExCdu4EHOOGy86Xu556g&hl=en&ei=cq0PTLi_IYOB8gbewcWECQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q&f=false">identified</a> as a freeholder and taxpayer of Ballston Spa.

<p>A Solomon Lockwood died in August 1822 in Ballston Spa. According to the newspaper, that individual had lived seventy-five years.</p>
