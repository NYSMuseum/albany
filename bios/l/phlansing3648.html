      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Philip Lansing</b></a> was born in February 1729. 
        He was a younger son of Albany businessman <a href="jolansing3739.html">Johannes 
        Lansing, Jr.</a> and his wife, Albany native <a href="../s/geerschuyler1729.html">Geertruy 
        Schuyler</a> Lansing. He grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>.</p>
      <p>In May 1757, Philip was twenty-eight when he married Albany native <a href="../h/elhun4800.html">Elsie 
        Hun</a>. By 1778, their eight children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a longtime pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor.</p>
      <p>He held a provincial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia commission</a> 
        - serving as a lieutenant under <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
        Schuyler</a> as early as 1755. Two decades later, he was called "Major" 
        when he resigned his commission in July 1775.</p>
      <p>Philip Lansing was a skipper who carried cargoes on the Hudson for <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
        Johnson</a> and others. During the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years 
        War</a>, he served with the boatman on Lake George.
      <p> 
      <p>In 1751, he was appointed constable for the second ward. He also served 
        as firemaster and was paid by the city of performing various tasks. His 
        <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#17">modest</a> third ward home was 
        listed on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3648">1763</a>, his name appeared 
        on a list of Albany freeholders. In <a href="../../census1790.html#3648">1790</a>, 
        his house included eleven family members and five slaves.</p>
      <p>Early in 1766, he joined his Albany neighbors in signing the constitution 
        of the Albany <a href="../../solconst.html#3648">Sons of Liberty</a>. 
        In July 1777, he was delegated to procure lead and axeheads from his Albany 
        neighbors by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. 
        In August 1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#3648">identified</a> 
        as an Assistant QMG. However, he does not seem to have been accorded a 
        <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> for militia service.</p>
      <p>After 1790, the name of Philip Lansing dropped from Albany rolls!</p>
