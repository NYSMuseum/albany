<strong>Maria Lents Egberts</strong></a> was the second wife of Albany skipper <a href="../e/egegberts4515.html">Egbert Egberts</a>. She was known as Maria Egbertsen and probably was born before 1720.

<p>She married Egberts following the death of his first wife about 1740. Four or more children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1743 and 1756.


<p>By the mid-1750s, she was raising a large combined family in Egberts's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home. Following the death of her husband in 1760, she was identified as the head of her houshold in city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> for the 1760s and '70s. At that time, she was assessed comparable to the levies on successful <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchants</a>.


<p>She was named heir and executor of the estate of her husband in the <a href="../../wills/willegegberts4515.html">will</a> he filed in early August 1760. He died a few days later. Maria Lents Egberts filed her own <a href="../../wills/willmalent.html">will</a> in 1763. According to city assessment rolls, she was alive at least until 1779. Her will passed probate in 1784.</p>
