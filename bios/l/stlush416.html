<P><a href="#sources"><b>Stephen Lush</b></a> was born about 1753. He may have been the son of Manhattan skipper and privateer William Lush.</p>

<p>He was educated at <a href="http://beatl.barnard.columbia.edu/kingsv1/">Kings College</a> - receiving a bachelor of arts degree in 
        1770 and a masters degree in 1773. He then clerked for New York attorney 
        William Smith, Jr. Admitted to the bar in 1774, twenty-one-year-old Stephen 
        Lush <a href="../../or/or-nw.html ">relocated</a> to Albany to practice 
        law. In Albany, he joined his brother <a href="rilush1047.html">Richard</a>, 
        a businessman and future land speculator, in a house in the second ward. 
        Both Lush brothers would settle in Albany - making the future state capital 
        their home for life!</p>

<p><a href="#sig"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigstlush.jpg" align=left border=0 hspace=4 vspace=4 width=200 alt="signature of Stephen Lush - 1777"></a>His budding legal career soon was interrupted by the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>. In 1776, he was elected to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> as a member from the second ward. By 1777, he had become the aide-de-camp (secretary) to General George Clinton and remained in that position when Clinton became Governor of New York State in 1778. He was also commissioned a captain of a Ranger company; then major,  and finally brigade major. Serving in the action around New York City, he was captured by the British and held for some time before being exchanged. A detailed pension application later described his extensive wartime service!</p>


<p>Lush married <a href="../s/lystringer5049.html">Lydia Stringer</a> in 1781. By 1798, seven of their children had been baptized in <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>. By <a href="../../census1790.html#416">1790</a>, his family was living in a large, new home on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market Street</a> that adjoined the mirror-image dwelling/office of his father-in-law, physician <a href="../s/sastringer5046.html">Samuel Stringer</a>.</p>

<p>Appointed clerk of the court of chancery in 1778, in 1792 he was elected to the state Assembly and then, in 1800, to the New York State Senate.</p>

<p>Stephen Lush was a longtime <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slaveholder</a> who maintained the practice until almost 1820. His Albany household had five slaves in 1810. In 1819, he sold the "time" of service of "Thomas, a negro boy . . . born 9/13/1799" to his father, Albany skipper <a href="../a/thallicott7126.html">Thomas Allicott</a>!</p>


<p>Stephen Lush died in April 1825 at the age of seventy-two. His <a href="../../wills/willstlush.html">will</a> divided an extensive estate among his wife and six surviving children. A large monument in Albany Rural Cemetery commemorates his distinguished life!</p>
