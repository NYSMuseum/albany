<P><a href="#sources"><b>Arie La Grange</b></a> was born in November 1738. He was the son of Jacobus and Engeltie Veeder La Grange of southern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. </p>


<p>In February 1762, he married <a href="../va/mavant6638.html">Maria Van Antwerpen</a> in Schenectady. By 1777, she had given birth to five children. He was a pewholder in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> although he seems to have had some association with the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> as well.</p>

<p>These La Granges settled in Albany where he owned a house and lots in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He was a merchant who purchased farm and forest produce from the countryside. In <a href="../../solconst.html#5906">1766</a>, he stood with his neighbors in opposition to the Stamp Act. In September 1775, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a> for the first ward. The war ended his public career but he did contribute financial support to the work of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>. Later, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany regiment of the militia.</p>

<p>In 1788, he signed an <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#5906">address</a> published in opposition to the new Federal constitution. In that year, his first ward holdings were <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5906">noted</a> on the assessment roll. In 1790, his first ward household was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#5906">Albany census</a>. By that time, his son, <a href="jalg5917.html">James</a> - a skipper, was taking over in his father's business. 

<p>Albany merchant Arie La Grange, "a much respected citizen," died on April 2, 1798. James La Grange buried his father from the Albany Dutch church. </p>
