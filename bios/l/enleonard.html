<strong>Enoch Leonard</strong></a> was born about 1755. We seek information on his origins and background. He probably was born in New England. 

<p>He served in the Revolutionary army and was commissioned assistant Commissary General in Albany in <a href="http://www.clements.umich.edu/Webguides/S/Stuart.html">1779</a>. He served in the upstate New York supply train and endured its <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gEsLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA91&dq=enoch+leonard#PPA75,M1">frustrations</a> for a number of years.

<p>In September 1783, he married <a href="../vv/mavvechten2556.html">Maria Van Vechten</a> at the <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">S</a>chaghticoke <A href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1802, the marriage produced at least six children.  Enoch was a member and trustee of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. Many of his immediate family were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA236&dq=enoch+leonard">buried</a> in the Presbyterian plot.

<p>These Leonards raised their family in a house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Some times he was called "Dr. Enoch Leonard." However, we have not yet encountered  confirming information.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#enle">1788</a>, the third ward assessment roll valued his house and lot and real property. In <a href="../../census1790.html#enle">1790</a>, his third ward household was served by two slaves. A decade later, eight family members and four slaves were members of his <a href="../../census1800.html#enle">household</a>.  The assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> valued his home, store, and personal holdings more substantially.

<p>In April 1790, he was named one of the executors of the <a href="../../wills/willbewashburn.html">will</a> of Bethuel Washburn.  In 1794, he was among the worthies who <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#enle">subscribed</a> in support of Union College. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, a list of freeholders identified him as a merchant living in the third ward.

<p>In 1797, he <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nymadiso/gzsmthfd.htm">purchased</a> a tract of land in Madison County from the State.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1798">1798</a> and 1799, he was elected to the Albany Common Council as an alderman for the third ward. In 1801, he joined in witnessing the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA438&dq=enoch+leonard+albany&lr=#PPA438,M1">will</a> of a North Albany neighbor.

<p>A list of invitees to a funeral in 1808 <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#enle">referenced</a> "Mr. Leonard's Corner" on Watervliet Street. "Doct'r" Enoch Leonard died in December 1810 at the age of fifty-five. His will passed probate on December 29. His widow lived into her nineties - dying in Lansingburgh at the age of ninety-four.

The life of Enoch Leonard has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>.
