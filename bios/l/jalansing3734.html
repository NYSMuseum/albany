<strong>Jacob Jo. Lansing</strong></a> was born in August 1753. He was the son of <a href="jolansing3744.html">Johannes J. Lansing</a> and his third wife <a href="../s/caschuyler1246.html">Catharina Schuyler</a> Lansing. Several same or similarly named individuals are <a href="jalansing3734.html">at risk</a> in the Albany area during his lifetime. Several of his siblings were <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ga4/myhayes_family/d_c9.html">connected</a> by marriage to what became Rockland County, New York. 

<p>He grew up in a large combined family in the <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home of a long-lived merchant and Albany mainstay who survived until 1808.

<p>This individual served in the Revolutionary army. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3734">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>About 1783, he married <a href="../h/janheyer.html">Jannetie Heyer</a>. Over the next decade, at least three <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=lansing+heyer+albany&source=bl&ots=I6sseQEaJv&sig=JwKR4YpckuHgxRXxNkEFc_Sgczo&hl=en&ei=A7ZlS5XrIJWd8AbfhNGRAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=lansing%20heyer%20albany&f=false">children</a> were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>This individual is <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/historyreformed01unkngoog/historyreformed01unkngoog_djvu.txt">said</a> to have lived on the west side of Market Street, the fourth door north of <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a>. That source also aludes to a portrait of this indivdual and of his wife, Jannetie. 

<p>Substantial <a href="../../census1790.html">co</a>mmunity-based information exists for this individual. However, we exercise caution in connecting him to such resources. We are most comfortable with information that specifies "Jacob <a href="../../res/sp.html">John</a> Lansing."

<p>Jacob Jo. Lansing died in June 1794 and was buried in the Dutch church plot. A newspaper <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/burnewsp.html">obituary</a> read: ". . . one of the aldermen . . . died after a short illness, age 40. He was an affectionate relation, a valuable friend, a firm magistrate and above al a man who feared God." </p>
