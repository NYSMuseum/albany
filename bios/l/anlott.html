<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ann Lott</b></a> was born on Long Island in September 1747. She was the daughter of John E. and Jannetje Probasco Lott - prominent residents of "Flatlands," Kings County.</p>

<p>How Ann Lott came to Albany is unknown. Perhaps she accompanied members of her family north during the <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">American Revolution</a>.</p>

        In June 1782, she became the second wife of Albany businessman <a href="../s/hestaats4587.html">Henry 
        Staats</a>. Her family provided an <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~rbillard/Lott_papers.htm">approrpriate 
        dowry</a>. Forty years old, she gave birth to her third child in 1787. 
        She later received acreage on Long Island from her father's estate.</p>

<p>These Staatses lived in the old <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler house</a> on State Street where Ann helped raise the children of her husband's first marriage. As late as 1810, their home was attended by six slaves!</p>

<p>Her husband died in 1814. The next year, she joined the second Dutch Reformed Church. For a time, she was listed in the city directory at 86 State Street as the "widow of Henry Staats."

<p>Ann Lott Staats died in February 1829 at age eighty-two. Following a funeral "from her late home at 2 South Pearl Street," she was buried in the Dutch church cemetery!.</p>
