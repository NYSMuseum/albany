<P>According to a death notice appearing in an Albany newspaper, <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Lightbody</strong></a> was born about 1765.

<p>In 1775, four men named "Lightbody" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jF1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=%22james+lightbody%22+albany&source=bl&ots=nq0ONb9ZVf&sig=JivYt5YGif-7zHY1hu2xdOo3fvk&hl=en&ei=uO7TTYrEAafr0QGKsPn6Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">signed</a> the Association in the Cornwell Precinct of Orange County. One of them, Gabriel Lightbody, was listed on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> there in 1790.

<p>Between 1789 and 1804, a James Lightbody was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c-F4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22james+lightbody%22+schaghticoke&source=bl&ots=V_QSFAvEAx&sig=yA6tx9OqLTLT-6fDq8xtPEVfQj0&hl=en&ei=cfTTTcu5H4fx0gHvvtmtDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22james%20lightbody%22%20schaghticoke&f=false">identified</a> as one of the licensed inn-keepers of <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#jail">1800</a>, his second ward home included two men, three women, and four adolescent children. That survey also listed him separately as "gaoler" and that the <a href="../../loc/jail.html">jail</a> held 17 men, an old woman , and four slaves. The census for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> noted fourteen men in his Albany household.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22lightbody+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22lightbody%20james%22&f=false">1813</a>, Albany city directories listed him at various addresses as the "gaoler." After, 1814, he no longer was listed as the "gaoler." As late as 1822, his address was given as "Schenectady <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">Tu</a>rnpike." 

<p>Other Lightbodys were identified as Albany residents during the 1820s and beyond. Without defining information on <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany, the family life of this Albany resident leaves us with many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.

<p>James Lightbody died in June 1848 at the age of eighty-three.</p>
