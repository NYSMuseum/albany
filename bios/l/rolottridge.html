<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, this <a href="#sources"> <strong>Robert Lottridge</strong></a> probably was born during the 1740s (<a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Lottridge-17">perhaps in 1747</a>). Most likely, he was the son of Albany <a href="../../loc/public.html">inn</a>keepers <a href="rlottridge453.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../h/elhopk.html">Elizabeth Hopkins</a> Lottridge. Occasionally, he was referred to as <a href="https://journals.psu.edu/wph/article/viewFile/7752/7525">Jr.</a>  A number of his siblings lived in Albany as adults. Also, a number of same named contemporaries (particularly toward the end of the century) complicate the assignment of qualitative information for his life. However, we move forward <a href="#hes">with hesitation</a> following the premise that this individual became a <a href="../../friends.html">Loyalist</a> and died in Canada in 1791.

      <p>In 1767, Robert Lottridge was a member of two Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        companies. In May of that year the name of "Robert Loterage" appeared 
        on the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#rolo">roster</a> of the city 
        based company captained by mayor <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham 
        C. Cuyler</a>. The <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ROk5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA853&lpg=PA853&dq=robert+lottridge&source=bl&ots=PtQaJdkcI4&sig=ihzmLDwhOP3rxYTKypyDTcqFBEw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiw2I_MgInKAhXG7SYKHQzICM0Q6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=robert%20lottridge%20&f=false">other</a> 
        was commanded Bernardus Bradt and was drawn from the first ward. 
      <p>Perhaps this individual married twice. He is <a href="http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Info/extras/Lottridge-Robert/Lottridge-Robert-certificate-appln.pdf">said</a> to have married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Maria Winegar" at the Reformed church in Stone Arabia in 1768. That union may have produced five sons. Next, he may have wed a much younger <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/r/y/c/Willard-A-Ryckman-FL/GENE17-0015.html">Sarah Ryckman</a> - who is said to have been the nanny of his children and then became his wife. That woman   bore him a daughter.

<p>By the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, this individual and his family had fled to Canada where he served the British in the "Indian Department" and was called "Captain." Thus, the second half of his intriguing life unfolded <a href="../../na/na.html">beyond</a> the parameters of our concern. 

<p>Captain Robert Lottridge is said to have died in Ontario on February 6, 1791.

<p>Perhaps it was his <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#rolo">name</a> (one of three Lottridges - the others probably his brothers) that appeared on a list of creditors of the estate of William Charles in 1793. Also, we surmise that the Robert Lottridge who was appointed Albany watchman in 1794 and afterward was not the subject of this sketch but a nephew. <br>
