<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Lansing</b></a> was born in November 1735. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="rlansing3656.html">Robert Lansing</a> and his first wife, <a href="../r/mgtroseboom1943.html"> Margarita Roseboom</a> Lansing. Her mother died when she was eleven and her father re-married. She grew up on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> where Robert Lansing  practiced the gunsmith's trade.</p>


<p>In June 1757, she married Albany native <a href="../w/hewendell2689.html">Hendrick J. Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1775, seven children had been christened in Albany where both parents were members and pewholders.</p>

<p>These Wendells set up their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Wendell was a businessman who was appointed sheriff of Albany County in 1777. For the next decade, their riverside home was an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#2689">landmark</a>. </p> 

<p>Hendrick J. Wendell died in October 1795. Maria took over as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">head</a> of their modest home. However, by 1800, Maria and her daughter were identified as <a href="../../poor.html#3503">poor</a> and were receiving aid from the city. Later, she ran a boardinghouse on lower Maiden Lane. Maria Lansing Wendell probably was dead by 1819.</p>
