          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Catharina Livingston</B></A> was baptized 
            in the Albany Dutch church in August 1745. She was the third of the 
            nine children born to Albany natives <a href="phlivingston.html">Philip 
            Livingston</a> and his wife, <a href="../t/chtbroeck25.html">Christina 
            Ten Broeck</a>. She grew up in New York City and in her parent's country 
            home on Brooklyn Heights. Hovever, these Livingstons were frequent 
            visitors to Albany.</P>

          <P>Shy of her nineteenth birthday, she married Patroon <a href="../vr/svr5114.html">Stephen 
            Van Rensselaer II</a> in New York City in January 1764. Their first 
            son, <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen</a>, was born in New York that 
            November. The marriage also produced another son and a daughter.</P>

          <p>Before long, the young patroon's family took up residence in a new <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor 
            House</a> built by Stephen in 1765. Catharina gave birth to three 
            children before her husband died suddenly in October 1769. Surrounded 
            by family and supported by servants, the twenty-four-year-old widow 
            would raise her children in the Albany countryside as her world headed 
            into an uncertain future.</p> 

          <p>From childhood, Catharina had known the comfort of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            Church</a>. Her marriage to Stephen Van Rensselaer II had further 
            elevated her status in the Albany church. In 1769, three seats in 
            the patroon's pew were reserved for the "patrooness!" Her connection 
            to the church became even stronger in 1775 when she married Dominie 
            <a href="../w/ewesterlo.html">Eilardus Westerlo</a>. For the next 
            fifteen years, she was the minister's wife - ensuring her new husband's 
            acceptance in the upper echelon's of regional society. By 1783, Catharina 
            had given birth to three Westerlo children.</p>

<p>Her new family lived at the manor house until her eldest son, Stephen Van Rensselaer III, came of age and became lord of the manor. By <a href="../../census1790.html#6867">1790</a>, the Westerlos moved into the parsonage located on Market Street. Westerlo died in December of that year - leaving Catharina a widow again. For a time, she resided in the parsonage. A few years later, she moved her family to a comfortable home on Pearl Street that in <a href="../../census1800.html#5034">1800</a> was served by seven slaves.</p>  
<p>Catharina Livingston Van Rensselaer Westerlo died in April 1810 at the age of sixty-five.</p>
