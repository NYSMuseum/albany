<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Pieter Loockermans, Sr.</strong></a> may have been born in Belgium  within a few years of 1620. He emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and witnessed baptisms in New Amsterdam as early as 1642. The latest firm refernce to him was when he was invited to the <a href="http://users.crocker.com/~jcamp/funeral1.html">funeral</a> of Jeremias Van Rensselaer in October 1674.

<p>He had a houselot in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and a garden near the <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">fort</a> as early as 1653</a>. In 1658, he was identified as a "boatswain" in the employ of the Dutch West India Company and that he was from Turnhout in Antwerp. Two years later, his name appeared on <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#5940">a list</a> of fur traders from the Beverwyck area  petitioning for fewer restrictions in engaging Native fur traders.

<p>He was the husband of <a href="../d/madon5931.html">Maria Donchesen</a> and the father of several children. Sometimes he was referred to as Pieter Loockermans, Sr. - probably to prevent confusion with his son, <a href="piloock5941.html">Pieter Loockermans, Jr</a>.

<p>Over the next decades, he appeared before the Beverwyck and then Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a>. In 1671, he was identified as a tavernkeeper. He may have been the <a href="../../census1679.html#36">Pr. Lokermans</a> who was identified as an Albany householder in a census taken in 1679. Or it may be his son and namesake.

<p>Perhaps he was the brother or other relation of Albany resident <a href="jaloock5936.html">Jacob Loockermans</a>!
 
<p>Pieter Loockermans, Sr. was dead by <a href="../../census1697.html#065">1697</a> when his widow was identified as the head of an Albany household.
