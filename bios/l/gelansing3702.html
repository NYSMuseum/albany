<strong>Gerrit A. Lansing</strong></a> was born in November 1705. He was the second son born to the marriage of middle-aged <a href="ablansing3062.html">Abraham G. Lansing</a> and the much younger Albany native <a href="../vt/magvtricht6601.html">Magdalena Van Tricht</a> Lansing. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of an Albany mainstay who lived until 1745. This individual was known as "Gerrit A. Lansing" to help prevent <a href="lansing.html#name">confusion</a> with a number of contemporary "Gerrit Lansings."

<p>He was called "of Schenectady" when he married Albany native <a href="../b/macbeekman3871.html">Machtel Beekman</a> in January 1738. The marriage was of short duration and childless as Machtelt died later that year. Thirty years later, he may have married again. In May 1768, "Gerrit A. Lansing" was identified as an Albany County merchant when he took out marriage bonds with the widow Ruth Man of New York City.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1727">1727</a>, he was appointed constable for the second ward. The <a href="../../org/cc.html#1728">next year</a>, he was named high constable.

<p>In October 1758, Gerrit A. Lansing <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&dq=%22Gerrit+A.%22+Lansing+albany#v=onepage&q=&f=false">bought</a> a plot of land off of Pearl Street along with Abraham Lansing - possibly his <a href="ablansing3064.html">older brother</a> or even a nephew. The property description referenced their house and lot in the second ward.

<p>We believe this individual lived in Albany - at least for <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=%22gerrit+a.+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=aLJzHkSdnI&sig=AFUVDpyZuir5Vkm3y0jXqnj_Fto&hl=en&ei=gZWBSuH9JI6Mtge6ksjJCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3#v=onepage&q=%22gerrit%20a.%20lansing%22&f=false">some</a> of his adult life. However, substantial community-based information identifying only "Gerrit Lansing" cautions us against making a number of linkages at this time. Also possible is that he lived with <a href="../bioindex.html#l">an</a> "Abraham Lansing" as he was without children (and thus necessitating a household) of his own.

<p>According to information kept in his father's <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible23.htm">family bible</a>, Gerrit A. Lansing died in November 1789 at the age of eighty-four. He had filed a <a href="../../sources.html#en">will</a> in 1780 which identified his wife "Ruth" as well as a numbers of nieces and nephews. That will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> on November 16. His widow lived until 1808.
