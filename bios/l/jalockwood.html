<strong>Jared Lockwood</strong></a> was born in July 1758 in Greenwich, Connecticut. He is <a href="http://boards.ancestry.com/localities.northam.usa.states.newyork.counties.albany/123.2/mb.ashx">said</a> to have been the third son of Joseph and Charity Knapp Lockwood. We seek information on his background and life before he settled in Albany.

<p>He <a href="#ar">served</a> in the Revolutionary army as a sergeant and orderly under Captain Ebenezer Stevens of the Connecticut troops. He participated in a number of military actions in lower New York and its environs. Afterwards, his widow was granted a military pension.

<p>In December 1780, he married <a href="../s/elskelding.html">Elizabeth Skelding</a> (Skelking) in Stamford, Connecticut where they then were living. The <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=johnldevinney&id=I0746">marriage</a> produced at least three children who were born in Connecticut..

 <p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#jl">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household was configured on the Albany census. A year earlier, his modest holdings were valued on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment roll</a>. In 1809, the third ward tax list included his storehouse and lot on the Quay. His unnamed son was included in that assessment. In 1813, he also leased a lot along the west side (above) the <a href="../../loc/publicsq.html">Public Square</a>.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22lockwood+jared&source=bl&ots=2hLxOZXx9A&sig=1u1u_V4JYutjq_trCGqkeuehJ04&hl=en&ei=JzFfSpOOH46itgfMkZzgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4">1813</a>, his boardinghouse, shop, and residence were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at various locations on Mark, Market, Dock, and Quay <a href="../../streets.html">Streets</a>.  

<p>Jared Lockwood died in August 1823 at the age of sixty-four. He was buried in the Presbyterian plot. On August 12, letters of administration were issued on his estate. Afterwards, his widow returned to Connecticut where she died in 1849.

<p><a name=ar></a><b>Pension material:</b> Copied from an <a href="http://www.myfamilysearch.net/getperson.php?personID=I3149&tree=2005217a">online printing</a> of his widow's pension claim: "Affidavit in Albany County, State of New York: "On the 7th of December, 1836, personally appeared Betsey Lockwood, of the City of Albany, aged 72 years, doth declare that she married Jared Lockwood, at Stamford, Connecticut, where they then resided, in December, 1780; that her husband fought in the battles of Flatbush and Brooklyn, when the British Army advanced on New York, 1776, and at the battle of White Plains in the same year. That he fought at the battle of Monmouth in June, 1778. The three years preceding the summer of 1780, he had been Orderly Sergeant in the Artillery Company under Capt. Ebenezer Stevens, Col. Lamb's Regiment of troops raised by the States of Conn. and NY, attached to, and forming part of the regular Army of the USA. He was discharged in the summer of 1780. Subsequent to our marriage my husband was constantly engaged in various war services: in cruising in the government arms boats in Long Island Sound, and the East River, reconnoitering within the enemies lines, and in communicating with our friends within the enemies posts. He was in an engagement at a place called Horse Neck. He was in a battle in the eastern part of the Town of Stamford. That he was engaged with a party of the enemy, who in the summer 1782, having landed and secreted themselves, surrounded on a Sunday afternoon the Meeting House in which the Rev. Moses Mather was preaching, and took Minister and Congregation prisoners. She also declares that Betsey Skelding mentioned in the annexed marriage certificate is one and the same person with Betsey Lockwood the deponent. And that she has resided at Albany ever since the death of her husband. Generally called Betsey, though now wtitten Elizabeth. (Signature: Elizabeth Lockwood) Jared Lockwood and Betsey Skelding were married by Charles Webb, Esq., Justice of the Peace for Fairfield County on Dec. 23d, 1780. The foregoing is a true copy of the Record, Certified by Seymour Jarvis, Town Clerk of Stamford, Conn."
