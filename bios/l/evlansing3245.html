<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Evert Lansing</strong></a> was born in December 1704. He <a href="../qqqq.html">seems</a> to have been the son of <a href="gelansing3461.html">Gerrit Lansing</a> and his second wife, the widow Catherine Glen Lansing. At least some of his early life was spent in the city of Albany.

<p>About 1735, he <a href="#marr">ma</a>rried <a href="../c/ancooper515.html">Anna Cooper</a>, eldest daughter of a soldier-turned-tailor. However, the marriage was not found in the extant records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1756, seven children were christened at the Albany church where both parents were  regular baptism sponsors and from where he buried his <a href="anlansing3154.html">sister</a> in 1760.

<p>These Lansings raised their family on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> where he was identified as a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3245">1742</a>. During the 1760s, his East side property was <a href="../../sources.html#uny">valued substantially</a> and was  located inland from Papsknee Island on the <a href="../../im/im1767.html">Bleecker map</a> (<font size=-1>identified with East side #32</font size>) of 1767. 
 
<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us he died in 1768 and that his widow lived into the 1790s. We seek information on the the later life and passing of Evert Lansing. </p>
