<p><b>H</b>ollander <a href="jlydius4614.html">Johannes Lydius</a> 
              brought a young family to America in 1700 when he was appointed 
              minister of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Reformed Church</a>. 
              Beloved by his congregation and widely respected by native peoples 
              and provincial officials alike, he served in Albany until his death 
              in 1710. Although his wife, <a  href="../r/irlydius4613.html">Isabella 
              Rachels</a>, and two daughters had been born in Europe, a son and 
              two more daughters were baptized at his Albany church. Her second marriage to a prominent <a href="../s/jastaats4595.html">physician</a> further solidified the family in provincial society.</p>
			  
 <p>Following the fur trade, the son, <a href="jhlydius4615.html">John 
              Henry Lydius</a> (1704-90), made his way to New France where he 
              married <a href="../m/gmlydius1473.html">Genevieve Masse</a>. His 
              legendary careers in the Indian trade and in land speculation provided 
              him with residences in Montreal, at Fort Edward, and a landmark 
              house on the corner of <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">State 
              and North Pearl Streets</a> in which the couple raised their seven 
              children.</p>
            <p>Although several daughters married into prominent New York families, 
              the Lydius family disappeared from Albany rolls when its last two 
              sons, <a href="blydius4620.html">Balthazar</a> and <a href="martinus.html">Martinus</a>, 
              left no children. Lydius Street (today’s Madison Avenue which includes 
              a long extension through the Pine Barrens to Schenectady) was named 
              for Dominie Lydius - the first of <a href="lydiusfm.html">thirteen 
              family members</a> to live in the city before 1800.</p>
            <p>The <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> has undertaken 
              an intensive <a href="#reconstitution">reconstitution</a> of the 
              Lydius family.</p>

              of the Lydius family was completed by <A href="../../art/art-welcome.html">intern</A> 
              Christopher Capozzi of the University at Albany, SUNY in 1990. The 
              fruits his work - an annotated list of family members who meet the 
              criteria for inclusion, a family tree that charts relationships, 
              updated biographies for all 13 family members, and an essay on his 
              internship/reconstitution experience, are on file at the project 
              office.</P>
