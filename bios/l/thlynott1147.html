<P><a href="#sources"><b>Thomas Lynott</b></a> was of <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> heritage. He lived in Albany during the mid-1760s. At that time, he was married to      <a href="../vv/elvvlk1227.html">Elizabeth Van Valkenburgh</a> - daughter of an Albany carpenter. The marriage produced at least two daughters.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigthlynott.jpg" align=right vspace=4 hspace=4 border=0 width=190  alt="signature of Thomas Lynott"> In 1766, he joined a number of Albany men in signing a <a href="../../solconst.html#1147">contstitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty in opposition to the Stamp Act. His <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> house was listed on an Albany assessment roll in 1767. That year, 
        he was a private in Barent Bradt's first ward company of the Albany County 
        <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. He was a communicant of 
        <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's church</a> and also belonged 
        to the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>. </p>
      <p>He may have been involved in land sales. In May 1769, his friend <a href="../d/hdenniston5136.html">Hugh 
        Denniston</a> said that Lynott was in Ireland. Later that year, Thomas 
        Lynott filed a <a href="../../wills/willthlynott.html">will</a>. It stated 
        that he was a resident of "Potamocassock" in Albany County. He divided 
        his estate consisting of real and personal properties among his wife and 
        two daughters. The will also mentioned two nephews living in Dublin, Ireland. 
        The will passed probate in September 1770.</p>
