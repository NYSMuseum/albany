      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Peter Lansing</b></a> was born in August 1721. 
        He was the son of <a href="jolansing3739.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/geerschuyler1729.html">Geertruy 
        Schuyler</a> Lansing. He was named for his mother's father, <a href="../s/pischuyler61.html">Pieter 
        Schuyler</a>. He grew up in a large family in the second ward home of 
        Albany mainline residents</p>
      <p>About 1745, he married <a href="../w/elwendell2857.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a>. 
        Between 1746 and 1758, eight children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where both parents were occasional baptism sponsors and where 
        Peter later served on the Board of Consistory.</p>
      <p>These Lansings quickly became Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#250">mainstays</a>. 
        They set up their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> where Peter served as firemaster, assistant, and was elected 
        <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> from 1761 to 1771. He was 
        a moderately successful merchant who was a frequent contractor of the 
        city government. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3642">1763</a>, 
        his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. In 1747, he was among 
        those named in the <a href="../../wills/willrygerr6011.html">will</a> 
        of a childless neighbor. In 1748, he received a <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler104.html">bequest</a> 
        from the estate of his uncle.</p>
      <p>He held land in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> 
        and was an agent for land sales in Hoosick. He probably should not be 
        confused with Peter Lansing who built a house in old <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nysarato/Sylvester/chap14.html">Saratoga</a> 
        in 1773.</p>
      <p>In his fifties at the outbreak of hostilities, he appears to have lived 
        through the War for Independence without incident. He was not accorded 
        a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">bounty right</a>, did not reappear 
        as a civic leader, and seems to have been absent from Albany-based business 
        activities during the 1780s.</p>
      <p>After <a href="../../census1790.html#3642">living</a> in the heart of 
        the first ward <a href="../../im/im1770.html">business district</a> for 
        many decades, by 1799, his residence was moved to <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a> where Peter, Elizabeth, a younger woman, and five slaves were 
        counted on the <a href="../../census1800.html#3642">census</a> of 1800. 
        A decade earlier, his slaves were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran 
        church</a>.</p>
      <p>Peter Lansing lost his wife in 1801. He died in May 1807 at the age of 
        eighty-six.</p>
