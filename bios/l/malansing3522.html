<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Lansing</strong></a> was born in January 1748. She was the first child of the marriage of Johannes Jacobse and Maria Huyck <a href="lansing.html">Lansing</a>. She grew up in a large family in the Albany hinterland.

<p>By 1768, Maria had married the slightly older Rensselaerswyck native <a href="../w/liwinne2998.html">Livinius Winne</a>. By 1788, ten children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>These Winnes raised their family in the part of the manor known as <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2998">1790</a>, the household of Levinus B. Winne included ten family members and three slaves. A decade later, their <a href="../../census1800.html#2998">home</a> housed three children and was served by one slave. 

<p>Conspicuous supporters of the crusade for American liberties and prominent residents of Watervliet, we <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> and hope to find more substantial qualitative information on their home life.

She was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=maria+%22wife+of+levinus+winne%22&source=bl&ots=Sq6sYNxkyf&sig=9nYo3CMNGsuMfYcsneCip1HtlRU&hl=en&ei=RvZgTo_vL-nI0AGH6qEq&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=maria%20%22wife%20of%20levinus%20winne%22&f=false">buried</a> in the Dutch church cemetery. In 1747, she was re-interred at Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
