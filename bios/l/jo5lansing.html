<strong>John 5 Lansing</strong></a> was the fifth generation of his family <a href="lansing.html#5">named</a> John. He was born during the second quarter of the eighteenth century and became an Albany resident. However, we have yet to match his life to basic demographics. We are not confident linking this biography to available demographic information.

<p>At the same time, "John 5" or "John S."  was an Albany mainstay for several decades. This profile organizes material related to "John 5 Lansing" and hopefully not to any of the other more than fifty "John <a href="lansing.html#name">L</a>ansings who <a href="../../criteria.html">belong</a> to our defined community population.

<p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1749">1749</a>,  "John 5 Lansing" was named constable for the first ward and then high constable.
 
<p>In October 1761, "Johannes Lansing" married twenty-three-year-old widow <a href="../b/caburhans.html">Catharina Burhans</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1783, nine children had been christened in Albany. Some of those baptism records identified the father as John 5 or V. He held a gallery pew in the church until his name was removed in 1790.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#j5l">1763</a>, the name of "John S. Lansing" appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#j5l">1779</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jo5l">1788</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> real and personal property located along <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> was valued on the Albany assessment rolls under the name of "John 5. Lansing."

<p>Even before the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 
April 1775, the "house of John 5 Lansing, innholder" hosted a number of meetings of <a href="../../coc.html">Albany committee</a> sub-committees. His subsequent accounts were paid by the committee.
  
<p>In August <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LwnYfKaK4ksC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=%22john+5+lansing%22&source=web&ots=IRyA2tKsTV&sig=_dKOsVBMt_DO3dVYIduDeCdKuL4&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result">1778</a>, he presented an account for supplying bread to the "state prisoners to the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Co</a>mmissioners on Conspiracies.

<p>John 5 Lansing was shown as an enlisted man on a wartime roster of John A. Bradt's company of rangers. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#j5l">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>However, in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of "John the <font size=-1>5th</font size> Lansing" was configured in Coxsackie. Perhaps, he had relocated there after 1788 as "surely" there could not have been another "John 5 Lansing" living in Albany County at that time..

<p>In April 1795, Rebecca Van Iveren <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">leased</a> a 100 acres or her 212-acre farm in Rensselaerswyck to "John S. Lansing."

<p>After thirty-eight years of marriage, John 5 Lansing <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=%22jacob+evertsen%22+albany&source=web&ots=SoevXJrhCi&sig=dO5deQud78xyfGPZu2HF50J80To#PPA161,M1">lost</a> his wife in October 1799.
