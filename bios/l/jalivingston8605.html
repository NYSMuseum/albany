<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Livingston</strong></a> was born in "New France" March 1747. He was a middle child in the large family of Albany natives <a href="jolivingston5017.html">John</a> and <a href="../t/catbroeck13.html">Catharina Ten Broeck</a> Livingston. John Livingston's business activities caused his family to live   in New York City, Montreal, and occasionally in Albany where his father was an elected alderman during the mid-<a href="../../org/cc.html#1745">1740s</a>.

<p>James Livingston
 is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=W4o-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1154&lpg=PA1154&dq=%22james+livingston%22+albany&source=bl&ots=hKRSSdXj51&sig=ua0n0U3gAhek2RR-tEnRQ9AHnB8&hl=en&ei=38-ETO2DBMSqlAep-7CCDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22james%20livingston%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have attended King's College in New York City. Also, he is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gjhWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22james+livingston%22+simpson&source=bl&ots=ijnxi99QPD&sig=17TTIQZ88F-qdMkctI3xUZuTGIM&hl=en&ei=rfiETMO6IoW8lQeI6Ky9Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDEQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22james%20livingston%22%20simpson&f=false">said</a> to have practiced law. These claims have not been <a href="../../res/ts.html">verified</a> and may relate to same-named contemporaries..

<p>In 1772, he is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Hyk4p06ULTwC&q=livingston#v=snippet&q=james livingston&f=false">said</a> to have married Scots<a href="../irish.html">-</a>Irish emigre Elizabeth Simpson who then was living in Montreal. The marriage produced nine children but only one was christened in Albany where John Livingston was 
        baptized in May 1777. 

<p>James Livingston was a merchant who probably lived in Canada from the end of the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven 
        Years War</a> until just before the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War 
        for Independence</a> when the Livingstons fell back to family property 
        in the upper Hudson Valley. 
      <p>Early in the struggle, James Livingston declared for the American cause and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XaA-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA375&lpg=PA375&dq=%22james+livingston%22+montreal&source=bl&ots=Qo1c44FXfQ&sig=UcIPMZ-9LJQZyB-qvvQZB2aA4Ew&hl=en&ei=eQKFTP-oCsH6lweX_NHuDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CB8Q6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=%22james%20livingston%22&f=false">notably</a> encouraged his neighbors in Canada to do the same. He was a contact of <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> and other American leaders and the open enemy of the British. Livingston became an officer in the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">Revolutionary 
        army</a>. He was colonel of a Continental <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Canadian_Regiment">regiment</a> 
        raised in Canada and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Yk5mAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA522&lpg=PA522&dq=%22james+livingston%22+grandson&source=bl&ots=lIJ2IFNuKl&sig=itbkUOdQdslRPQp74HpcMg1UdSg&hl=en&ei=UNaETOnbPIP6lweMq_XhDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22james%20livingston%22%20grandson&f=false">serving</a> throughout New York for most of the war years. It was disbanded on 
        the first day of 1781 and Livingston then retired from military service.
		 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8605">1779</a>. he was identified 
        as the owner of a piece of property in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. 
<p>After the war, he settled first in the Mohawk Valley. In 1790, his large family was listed on the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyherkim/census/caughna1790.html">census</a> 
        for Caughnawaga in newly created Montgomery County. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CYYHSzozWPUC&pg=PA186&lpg=PA186&dq=%22james+livingston%22+albany&source=bl&ots=5F4VDk4vDQ&sig=PcLdQr9l099KX1_TtXGVCR0wWe8&hl=en&ei=38-ETO2DBMSqlAep-7CCDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CCYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22james%20livingston%22%20albany&f=false">represented</a> Montgomery in the New 
        York State Assembly from 1784 to 1791 and was a member of the New York State Board of Regents. Although his Canadian lands had been confiscated, he received 
        considerable acreage in New York and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gjhWAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA58&ots=ijnxi99QPD&dq=%22james+livingston%22+simpson&output=text#c_top">beyond</a> by virtue of his military service.
<p>He was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=D-cCeOEXGyoC&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22james+livingston%22+stillwater&source=bl&ots=thxh_bMIg_&sig=UDzhs6ROqvAZWV65ymNgJuAQQn4&hl=en&ei=uWOGTN9bgoKUB6CfwLgP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22james%20livingston%22%20stillwater&f=false">notable mason</a> but does not seem to have been active in the <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Albany lodge</a>.		
<p>Elizabeth Simpson Livingston <a href="http://www.sewellgenealogy.com/p455.htm#i14401">died</a> at Schuylerville in June 1799 at the age of forty-nine. We seek information on his life over the next thirty years.		
		 
<p>James Livingston died in Stillwater in November 1832 at the age of eighty-five.

<p>Although technically within the <a href="../../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion among the people of colonial Albany, most of his long and distinguished life was like that of other members of his famous family - an early Albany boy who made good - but elsewhere!</p>
