<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Abraham Lansing</strong></a> was born in July 1752, He was the son of Albany merchant <a href="ablansing3064.html">Abraham Lansing</a> and his second wife and cousin <a href="calansing3187.html">Catharina Lansing</a>. His father died in 1759 and his mother re-married. He often was referred to as "Abraham A. Lansing." 

<p>In  September 1774, he married <a href="../vr/elvr5078.html">Elsje Van Rensselaer</a> - a daughter of <a href="../vr/kvr5131.html">Killiaen</a> and sister of businessman <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a> later of Cherry Hill. By 1794, the marriage had produced ten children. However, Elsje Van Rensselaer Lansing died in 1796. Three years later, Abraham married Elsje Lansing, a cousin. All his children from the first marriage were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a lifelong member.  

<p>These Lansings were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#3694">mainstays</a> for many years. Abraham followed his father in business and also was identified in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a> as a mariner and <a href="../../trades/tanner.html"> tannery</a> owner. Following his marriage, he lived in the third ward where he served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in 1775 and '76. 

<p>He supported the supply side of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties and later was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service as an ensign in the Albany city regiment!

<p>In 1782, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtte.html">will</a> of a prominent Albany widow.

<p>By the late 1790s, he had settled into a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3694">moderately valued</a>, traditional <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">townhouse</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> - which, in <a href="../../census1800.html#3694">1800</a>,  was attended by eleven slaves. His leather <a href="../../fire.html#lansing">fire bucket</a> dating from that time is in the <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/collections/history/">collection</a> of the New York State Museum. He owned other properties in Albany as well.

<p>After the war, he took his place within the Albany business community. Commercial activities were supplemented by processing and transportation services. His move by <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a> to 212 <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> (<font size=-1>still in the directory in 1820 as 652 South Market</font size>) was followed by a final relocation to Cherry Hill in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> where he lived out his life.

<p>Abraham A. Lansing died in February 1822 at age seventy. He was buried on his Cherry Hill property. His will passed probate in March.
