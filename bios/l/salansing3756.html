<P><a href="#sources"><b>Sander Lansing</b></a> was born about 1724. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="joglansing2051.html">Johannes G.</a> and <a href="../s/hesanders1421.html">Helena Sanders</a> Lansing. He was a younger son of a prominent businessman and civic leader.  </p>

<p>Sander Lansing was a <a href="../../census1756.html#1">baker</a>. Past his thirty-second birthday, he married a younger <a href="../vp/abvplanck.html">Abigail Verplanck</a> in 1753. The marriage produced no children. But a number of Lansing family members named their children for him.</p>

      <p>He baked from his landmark home on the corner of <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market 
        Street</a> and Maiden Lane for over fifty years. In <a href="../../census1790.html#3756">1790</a>, 
        the aging couple was attended by two slaves. He also owned a lot in the 
        <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.</p>

      <p>During the 1750s and 60s, he served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. 
        During the war for Independence, he baked bread on contract to the Albany 
        <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. However, his 
        name did not appear on any militia or <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty 
        rolls</a>!</p>

<p>Well-known and moderately successful, Sander Lansing <a href="../../census1800.html#3756">lived</a> on without reknown through the 1780s and 90s. His wife died in 1805. Sander Lansing died in April 1807 a few months shy of his eighty-fourth birthday.</p>
