<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Lambertie Loockermans</strong></a> was born prior to recorded baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - probably during the late 1670s. She was the daughter of <a href="piloock5940.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../d/madon5931.html">Maria</a> Loockermans. She grew up in the family of an Beverwyck/Albany <A HREF="../../census1679.html#36">main</a>liner where she was a younger daughter. 

<p>As early as 1696, Lambertie was counted among the church members. Her father had passed on by <a href="../../census1697.html#065">1697</a> when she was counted as the lone child in the household of her widowed mother.

<p>In In November 1700, she married <a href="../o/aroo410.html">Ariaan Oothout</a> at the Albany church. By 1723, nine children had been christened at the church where both parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>These Oothouts initially <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#410">raised</a> their family in the third ward. However, by <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, they had relocated to the Manor where Ari was a conspicuous <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#410">freeholder</a> until his death in 1752.  

      <p>We seek defining information on the later life and passing of Albany native 
        Lambertie Loockermans Oothout. </p>
