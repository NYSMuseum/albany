<strong>Geertruy Lansing</strong></a> was born in September 1758. She was the youngest daughter born to Albany mainstays <a href="pelansing3642.html">Peter</a> and <a href="../w/elwendell2857.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> Lansing. She was named for her grandmother and grew up in a comfortable merchant's <a href="../../census1756.html#250">home</a> in Albany's first ward.

<p>About 1785, she married <a href="../w/jahwendell2883.html">Jacob H. Wendell</a>. By 1800, the marriage had produced three children - although Geertruy was in her forties at the birth of their last child.

<p>These Wendells lived on <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a> in the third ward where Jacob was a skipper and businessman. Their family was small but, in <a href="../../census1790.html#2883">1790</a>, was attended by three slaves


<p>Geertruy lost her husband in 1826. The <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> for 1827 identified her as "Widow Gertrude Wendell" with her residence at 31 Columbia Street. Geertruy Lansing Wendell died in May 1827 at the age of sixty-eight and was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
