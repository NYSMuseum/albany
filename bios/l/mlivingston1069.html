<p>Born in Albany in 1681, <a href="#sources">Margaret</a> was the eldest daughter of <a href="rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a> and <a href="../s/alschuyler95.html">Alida Schuyler's</a> nine children. With Alida a particularly active businesswoman and mother, Margaret could be expected to help out raising younger brothers and sisters.</P>

<P>In 1700, her family's landmark Albany home was the site of her marriage to Samuel Vetch - a recently arrived Scottish adventurer, distant relative, friend of her brother, and thirteen years older than the 19-year-old bride. <a href="#artist"><IMG

src="../../images/jpg/mlivingston.jpg" vspace=4 width=200></a>Vetch's 
  <A href="#Vetch's">biography</A> offers rare insight on their courtship. A year 
  later, their only daughter, Alida, was baptized in the Albany Dutch church. 
  Shortly thereafter, mother and daughter were painted by an <a href="#artist">unknown 
  artist</a>.</P>

<P>Although they were frequent guests at the Livingston Manor House and maintained her family's winter <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1069">home</a> in Albany, the new couple were given a "palatial residence" in New York City from where Samuel Vetch could pursue his sometimes-shady 
commercial interests. These ambitions included long and frequent absences which 
left Margaret alone in the large Manhattan house - often with good reason to 
fear that her husband had been lost at sea. During those years, she began <A 
href="#Margaret Vetch">trading and shipping</A> - but not on the scale of her mother.</P>
<P>Vetch's business and public service took him to Boston and to Annapolis 
Royal. His family lived with him in those places while he was "home." But Vetch 
moved too often to accomodate any real family life. In 1706, Margaret gave birth 
to a son, the sickly "Billy," to a stillborn baby in 1713, and, in 1722 - at age 
forty-one, to an unnamed daughter who died in infancy.</P>
<P>Throughout the marriage, Vetch suffered disappointed ambitions and financial 
reversals. In 1717, he sailed to London and, against his wishes, was followed by 
Margaret and Billy - Alida being left with family in Boston. The Vetches stayed 
in England and nothing more was heard of their son.</P>
<P>Samuel Vetch's fortunes continued to decline until his death in debtors 
prison in 1732. His widow was stranded in England and troubled by creditors. 
With her daughter now married and her parents both dead, Margaret returned to 
New York. Utilizing her inheritance, she resumed trading, coddled her 
grandchildren, and lived on Manhattan until her death in the summer of 
1758.</P>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Margaret Livingston Vetch is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1069. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.


<P><A name="Vetch's">The following is excerpted from G. M. 
Waller, <I>Samuel Vetch: Colonial Enterpriser</I> (Chapel Hill, NC, 1960), pp. 
44-45. In March 1700, Margaret Livingston's uncle wrote to her father that he 
heard that Vetch "was making love to your daughter, Margaret." He added that "if any such thing be concluded with you, I wish them much joy." But the same 
person, who had actually witnessed the baptism of Samuel Vetch thirty-two years earlier, felt compelled to tell his brother "my positive advice that you do what you can to oppose it." But if the advice was "too late," then "nothing should be said about it at all."</P>
