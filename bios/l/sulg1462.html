<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://www.conovergenealogy.com/conover-p/p1369.htm">res</a>ouces,  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Susanna La Grange</strong></a> was born in 1754. She then would have been the third daughter of Jellis and Anna (born) La Grange of New Jersey. However, <a href="../qqqq.html">other origins</a> appear plausible as well.

<p>Unresolved, is the <a href="../qqqq.html">issue</a> of how/why this young woman found herself in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> Albany. 

<p>In May 1777, Susanna married patriot soldier <a href="../g/rogray8258.html">Robert Gray</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as single people "of this county." The marriage produced at least three children. 

<p>The couple first made their <a href="../../census1790.html#8258">home</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. However, by 1800, Robert Gray had re-located his enterprises and family to a Guilderland farm where they lived for many years. The Gray farm was located on Settles Hill Road and includes a family cemetery.


<p>Susanna La Grange Gray lost her husband at the end of 1834. She died in February 1838 at the age of eighty-three. She is said to have been buried on her son's Guilderland farm.</p>
