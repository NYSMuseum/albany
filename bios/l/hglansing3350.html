<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick G. Lansing</b></a> probably was born prior to 1640 and came to America with his parents, <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="geflansing3060.html">Gerrit Frederickse</a> and <a href="../h/elizhendrix.html">Elizabeth Hendrix</a> Lansing. The Lansings settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and this individual was first noted in Albany area records in 1666.</p>

<p>His wife was Elizabeth Caspers (<a href="../h/hallenbeck.html">Hallenbeck</a>) - the mother of at least five children prior to her passing in 1685. He was a longtime member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>By <a href="../../census1679.html#3350">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. For the next three decades, he was a pillar of the Albany community - serving on juries, acting as surety, and appearing in cases before the Albany court. Like his brothers, he was a <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> whose property ranked him with other middling Albany businesssmen. In 1697, his householdwas configured on the city <a href="../../census1697.html#029">census</a> - next to that of his mother and step-father. At that time, it included a woman (perhaps his eldest daughter) and two children. Two years later, he joined with other Albany mainstays in signing a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3350">loyalty oath</a> to the King of England.</p> 
<p>In 1702 and in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3350">1709</a>, his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> was valued moderately on citywide assessments. 

<p><a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer Hendrick G. Lansing died in July 1709.</p>
