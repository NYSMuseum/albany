<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Catharina Loockermans</strong></a> was born during the mid-seventeenth century. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="piloock5940.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../d/madon5931.html">Maria</a> Loockermans. She grew up at her father's house in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>.
 
<p>By the 1680s, she had become the wife of <a href="../g/jasgoewy5158.html">Jan Salomonse Goewy</a>. By 1701, ten of their children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member and frequent baptism sponsor. She may have given birth several more times prior to the existence of surviving baptism records which date to 1683.

<p>These Goewys lived on the east side of what became <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> where Jan Salomonse was identified as a householder as early as <a href="../../census1679.html#5158">1679</a>.

<P>Jan Salomonse died in September 1731. Catharina Loockermans Goewy may have witnessed a baptism in Albany in June 1734. After that, her name dropped from Albany records.
