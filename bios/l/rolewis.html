<P>According to subsequent information, 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Robert Lewis</strong></a> was born about 1724.  We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a>  information on his background and early life.


<p>In 1773, he would have been approaching fifty when he married a somewhat younger widow named <a href="silewis1190.html">Sidney Crawford</a>. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#mer">merchant</a>. His will, filed in 1796, named a son and five daughters as his living heirs.

<p>By 1784, he had settled in Albany where he was running a <a href="../../art/oldmrbanyar.html#lewis">landmark</a> tavern on <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html#lewis">upper</a> State Street. Over the next decade, "Lewis's Tavern" was a popular meeting place, auction and banquet house, ticket office, and stagecoach stop. On a number of occasions, he was paid from the city treasury. 

<p> In 1790, the <a href="../../census1790.html#role">census</a> showed that a man, four boys, six females, and six slaves were living under his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#role">roof</a>. He also owned a house on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>.  

<p>In 1789, a tract of 200 acres on Lake Champlain (at Split Rock) was confirmed to Robert Lewis and was known as "<a href="http://lcmm.org/shipwrecks_history/shipwrecks/ore_bed_harbor.htm">Lewis's Patent</a>."


<p>Robert Lewis filed a will in August 1796. It named his wife, Sidney, son <a href="stlewis.html">Stewart</a>, and five daughters as his heirs. He died in June 1798 at the age of seventy four. His will passed probate in April 1799.</p>
