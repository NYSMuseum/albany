<strong>Anna Lievens (Liverse)</strong></a> probably was born during the 1630s. She is believed to have been the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> pioneers Jan and Maritie Lievers.


<p>In July 1657, she married widower <a href="../vs/ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse Van Schaick</a>. By 1668, the marriage had produced six children. She was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and a regular baptism sponsor there.

<p>After the wedding, Anna was installed as the <a href="../vs/vschaick.html">Van Schaick</a> matriarch in her husband's Beverwyck house that already included young children. 


<p>As Goosen Gerritse was about to sail to Holland in 1668, Anna Lievens Van Schaick and her husband filed a joint will. He returned to Albany but died about 1676. Anna was identified as the head of their Albany household in <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>. Selling off some of her late husband's <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> holdings, Anna remained an Albany resident at least thru <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#6500">1689</a> when her maiden name appeared on a list of first ward subscribers.</p>

<p>Sometime thereafter, Widow Anna Lievens Van Schaick re-located to New York where she filed a <a href="../../wills/willanliev.html">will</a> in April 1702. It named her children and described her property. She died shortly afterwards as the will passed probate on June 30 of that year.</p>
