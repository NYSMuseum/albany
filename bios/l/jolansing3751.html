<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John E. Lansing</strong></a> was born in 1743 and christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on May first. He was the son of <a href="evlansing3245.html">Evert</a> and Anna Cooper Lansing. He grew up on his father's <a href="../../im/im1767.html">farm</a> on the East <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>.

<p>By the end of 1766, he had married <a href="../s/mastaats.html">Maria Staats</a>. By 1787, five children had been christened in Albany. 

<p>As a number of John Lansings lived in and around Albany during his lifetime, at this time we must integrate information on "John E. Lansing" only. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">1776</a>, John E. Lansing <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1JMLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=%22john+e+lansing%22+albany&source=bl&ots=kplidpgBE4&sig=w-24Pb-4vPIH22sdsG2-z-mRmuc&hl=en&ei=D_T4TanXLsXDgQe214H8Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22john%20e%20lansing%22%20albany&f=false">was</a> the adjutant for the Fourth Regiment of Albany County Militia. Afterwards, he received a land bounty right in conjunction with the Fourth Regiment.

<p>In September 1780, "John E. Lansing," <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting02paltrich#page/519/mode/2up">identified</a> as a farmer of the East District of the Manor posted bail of £100 with the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#3751">1790</a>, the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household of John E. Lansing was configured on the Albany census. Beyond that, <a href="../../cbr.html">co</a>mmunity-based references to him have not yet been uncovered.

<p><a href="http://history.rays-place.com/ny/ren-schodack-ny.htm">Perhaps</a> he was the "John E. Lansing" who settled in Schodack  and <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/historyofreforme00poc/historyofreforme00poc_djvu.txt">pet</a>itioned for the formation of a Reformed church there during the latter part of the eighteenth century. Perhaps, he was a widower and had a <a href="http://grandmaderbyshire.tripod.com/">second marriage</a> to a widow about his age in 1807. Perhaps he filed a <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/rensselaer_will4.htm">will</a> in Rensselaer County and died there in 1821.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> more definitive and connecting information on the later life of John E. Lansing. </p>
