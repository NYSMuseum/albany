<strong>Jacob G. Lansing</strong></a> was born in October 1737. He was the son of <a href="gejalansing3705.html">Gerrit J.</a> and his first wife, <a href="../e/maeverts.html">Maria Evertsen</a> Lansing. Maria died and his father re-married in 1739. He was known as "Jacob G. Lansing" to prevent confusion with a number of other same-named kin. He grew up in a large, combined family in a landmark home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>.

<p>In March 1767, he married Neeltie Roseboom at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. That marriage was childless and Neeltie died. In August 1774, he married Jemmetie (Frances) Lansing also at the Albany church where he was a member and pewholder. His second marriage to the daughter of his <a href="jalansing3477.html">same-named uncle</a> and mentor produced five children born between 1775 and 1786.

<p>Although his father was a merchant and <a href="../../census1756.html#271">gunsmith</a>, Jacob came from a family of <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmiths</a> and entered that field as well. Prior to his marriage, he served as <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">constable</a>, as a replacement firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1764">1764</a>, and <a href="../../res/sp.html">pr</a>obably was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. He belonged to the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#3726">Masonic lodge</a>. In 1768, he was among the <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/the_builder_1920_june.htm">contributors</a> for the new Masonic building .

<p>In 1766, he joined other community men in signing a <a href="../../solconst.html#3726">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty. He was among those who reportedly were protesting the Stamp Act at an Albany tavern.

<p>Thirty-seven at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, we seek precise information on "
Jacob G.'s" wartime activities. In 1775, he was <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">co</a>mmissioned a lieutenant in the First New York Regiment. In <a href="http://morrisonspensions.org/joralemon.html">1777</a>, he was Colonel of a militia regiment. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3726">land bounty right</a> in  conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1781">1781</a>, "Jacob G. Lansing" was elected assistant alderman for the third ward. In August 1782, he was paid by the city council for making a gold box as a gift for General Washington.  Re-elected in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1782">1782</a>, he served several more terms.

<p>In 1788, his name appeared on a <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#3726">petition</a> submitted by Albany Antifederalists.

<p>From the 1760s on,  his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">holdings</a> were valued on city assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3726">rolls</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#3726">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, his third ward household was configured on the city census.


<p> Jacob G. Lansing died in November 1803 and was buried from his church. He had lived sixty-six years. His widow, "Frances," passed in March 1807.</p>
