<strong>William Loveridge, Jr.</strong></a> probably was born during the 1650s. Perhaps he was born in Dorsetshire, England. He was the son of hatter <a href="wmlov1045.html">William</a> and Temperance Loveridge. He came to America with his father. By 1670, the Loveridges had settled in Albany.

<p>During the 1670s, he appeared before the Albany court on charges relating to the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#1042">1679</a>, his name was included on a census of Albany housholders and listed below that of his father. After that, his name is absent from the Albany community record. 

<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://familyhistoriesgen.tripod.com/id3.html">sources</a>, he married Margaret Du Mond of Ulster County in October 1682. Some of their children established families in the lower Hudson Valley. Perhaps their daughter, Temperance, was born in Dorset, England about 1695!

<p>William Jr. was among the <a href="../../wills/willwmlov1045.html">beneficiaries</a> of the estate of his father which included land south of today's Catskill. Perhaps he settled on the so-called "Loveridge Patent" which he inherited outright from his father. 


<p>William Loveridge, Jr. filed a will in February 1703. It stated that, at that time, he was an innkeeper in Perth Amboy, New Jersey.</p>
