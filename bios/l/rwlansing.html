        Wynkoop Eights</a>. He called her husband, <a href="../e/joeights7933.html">Dr. 
        Jonathan Eights</a>, "uncle!" 
      <p>He became a clerk in the Albany law office of Sanders Lansing - brother of the chancellor. There he met interesting and important notables including Aaron Burr. He left Albany in 1816.</p>

<p>Robert Wynkoop Lansing was living in 1878 when he sent his story to a daughter. He died in 1885. Do not miss the opportunity to <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~wynkoop/webdocs/rwlansng.htm">read his story</a>!</p>
