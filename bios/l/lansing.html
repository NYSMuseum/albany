<p><b>W</b>ith more than 400 family members <a href="../../criteria.html">in 
            the city</a> before 1800, the Lansings are, by far, the largest <a href="../../familynames.html">early 
            Albany family</a>. After Beverwyck became Albany in 1664, the Lansings 
            became mainstays in the <a href="../../earlycity.html">colonial city</a>, 
            spread throughout the region, then settled across New York and the 
            United States. Today, they are one of the most widespread and broadly 
            successful of the <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland-era</a> 
            early Albany <a href="../../nnfamilies.html">families</a>.

<p>The Albany Lansings are the descendants of <a href="geflansing3060.html">Gerrit Frederickse</a> and his wife <a href="../h/elizhendrix.html">Elizabeth Hendrix</a> who came to America with their European-born children 
            about 1640. Within a few decades of settling in Albany, Gerrit Frederickse 
            was dead but three sons and three daughters had found partners and 
            were raising families of their own. The city <a href="../../census1697.html">census 
            of 1697</a> listed the households of sons baker/contractor Gerrit 
            Lansing, butcher/trader <a href="hglansing3350.html">Hendrick</a>, 
            trader/landholder <a href="jolansing3440.html">Jan Lansing</a>, grandson 
            <a href="ablansing3062.html">Abraham G. Lansing</a>, and also the 
            home of <a href="../vd/woavdu.html">Wouter Albertse Van Den Uythoff</a> 
            - a widowed baker who had married widow Elizabeth Hendrix several 
            decades earlier. Of the daughters, Gysbertje - the wife of Hendrick 
            Roseboom, and <a href="hilansing3400.html">Hilletie Ketelhuyn</a> 
            - the widow of <a href="../vd/svdz.html">Storm Vanderzee</a>, were 
            living in the city.</p>
          <p>Over the next century, the Lansings spread out in Albany and in the 
            greater region. More so than most New Netherland families, the Lansings 
            maintained a strong and even expanded presence in the city of Albany. 
            The mix of trades, crafts, and business activities of the householders 
            of 1697 was characteristic and became even more diversified through 
            succeeding generations. The Lansings were prominent within the Albany 
            community and more widely known as silver and gun smiths. Middling 
            with some upward mobility, Lansing sons often followed in their father's 
            footsteps while daughters were well-represented as wives in traditional 
            and newcomer city homes. Thirteen Lansing-named families appeared 
            on the <a href="../../census1756.html">census</a> of householders 
            taken by the British army in 1756. 
<p>Although the family continued to expand into the growing countryside, in 1790, the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> still listed seventeen Lansing-named households in the city of Albany. These included the homes of gunsmith <a href="rlansing3656.html">Robert Lansing</a>, baker <a href="salansing3756.html">Sanders Lansing</a>, and  businessman <a href="abglansing3695.html">Abraham G. Lansing</a> who married the daughter of <a href="../y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> and raised a very large family. Among their sons was attorney and congressman <a href="geylansing.html">Gerrit Yates Lansing</a>.</p>

<p>Always involved in city affairs, the American Revolution elevated 
            the Lansing family to new prominence. Several Lansings attended the 
            Albany Committee of Correspondence as members and associates while 
            others served in the military and on supply lines. <a href="jolansing3755.html">John 
            Lansing, Jr.</a>, a one-time clerk and secretary, was elected to the 
            New York State Assembly, appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
            of Albany, delegate to the <a href="http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/constitution/newyork.html">Federal 
            Convention</a> of 1787, and later became chancellor of New York State.</p>
          <a name=name></a> 
<p>In government, business, church, the courts, and other activities, 
            references to the Lansings are prominent in all parts of the community 
            record. However, <b>traditional naming practices</b> and the shear 
            size of the Albany family present considerable problems in the assignment 
            of defining information. Some are easily delineated because they were 
            named <a href="rlansing3656.html">Robert</a>, Sander, or Jeremiah. 
            However, the historical detective is often thwarted by the fact that 
            so many Lansings were named either <a href="../../bios/bioindex.html#gelansing">Gerrit</a>, 
            Jacob, or John. For example, after <a href="jolansing3440.html">Jan 
            Lansing</a>, more than fifty city Lansings born before 1800 were christened 
            Johannes or one of its variants - thus creating perplexing problems 
            in the development of individual biographies.</p>
          <p><a name=5></a>Our puzzlement is somewhat abated by the practice of 
            identifying them as Johannes E. (son of <a href="evlansing3245.html">Evert</a>), 
            Johannes Ja. (the son of Jacob not to be confused with Jo. - the son 
            of John), <a href="jolansing3755.html">John Lansing, Jr.</a> (the 
            younger - even though he was the son of Gerrit), or <a href="jo5lansing.html">John 
            5 Lansing</a> - an innkeeper who was the fifth generation "John" in 
            his particular line. The Gerrits, Jacobs, Marias, and other Lansings 
            pose similar predicaments.</p>
          <p>More often than most early Albany <a href="../../familynames.html">families</a> 
            - and possibly abetted by the shear size and Albany focus of the family, 
            Lansing cousins frequently intermarried!
