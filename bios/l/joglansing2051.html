<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Gerritse Lansing</b></a> was born in January 1675. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="geglansing3698.html">Gerrit G.</a> and <a href="../vd/elvdu2333.html">Elsje Van Den Uythoff</a> Lansing. She grew up in a large family in a modest <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader's</a> home located near the Albany fort. </p>


<p>In September 1704, he married <a href="../s/hesanders1421.html">Helena Sanders</a> at her mother's Albany house. By 1718, five of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>These Lansings set up their household in Albany's first ward. Assessment <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2051">rolls</a> for the early 1700s revealed moderate holdings. He served the community as a constable (first in 1700), firemaster, juror, and was <a href="../../corporation.html">elected</a> assistant alderman for the first ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1710">1710</a> and again in 1711. He served on committees chiefly concerned with servicing the Indian houses, wells, and gates. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2051">1720</a>, he was listed among the city's qualified voters.</p>

<p>Johannes G. Lansing lost his wife in 1744. By that time, his name no longer appeared on city rolls. Perhaps he lived with his son <a href="rlansing3656.html">Robert</a> or another of his adult children. According to information printed in a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible22.htm">family bible</a>, he died in August 1771 at the age of ninety-seven years, six months, and nineteen days!</p>
