<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Elizabeth Lansing</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s.  She was the daughter of Albany pioneers <a href="hglansing3350.html">Hendrick G.</a> and Lysbeth Caspers Lansing. Her father was a fur trader who raised a large family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.
 
<p>In April 1697, she married Albany native <a href="../b/dabradt4340.html">Daniel Bradt</a>. By 1713, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a lifelong member and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Bradts set up their home near Daniel's family in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany. They were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#127">mainstays</a> who may have owned a farm at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> as well.
 
<p>In October 1726, she was a widow when she petitioned the Albany government for payment of her late husband's account. Elizabeth Lansing Bradt died sometime thereafter!
