<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacobus (James) La Grange</b></a> was born in January 1763 and baptized at the Schoharie Lutheran church. He was the first child born to Albany residents <a href="arlg5906.html">Arie</a> and <a href="../va/mavant6638.html">Maria Van Antwerpen</a> La Grange.</p>


<p>In February 1784, he married Anna Visscher - the mother of five children were born before her death in 1793. In February 1796, he married Maria Mc Crea, with whom he had nine more children. He was a member and an <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">officer</a> of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Later, he was involved in the operations of the Second (<a href="../../drc.html#second">South</a>) Reformed church. He also seems to have belonged to the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. </p>

<p>Jacobus (sometimes referred to as James) was a boat captain or skipper - probably starting out by running his father's sloop on the Hudson. In April 1780 Arie La Grange posted a bond on behalf of Jacobus with the  Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies. That guarantee was required for those expecting to sail on the Hudson during the latter years of the  <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>. A few years later, Jacobus served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and chimney viewer. However, he did not achieve the political prominence of his father.</p>

<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5917">1788</a> and <a href="../../census1790.html#5917">1790</a>, his growing family had settled into a house in the second ward. Withion a decade, he would <a href="../../census1800.html#5917">relocate</a> to the first ward (probably to his father's house after Arie's death in 1798) and become a mainstay at 68 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>.</p>


<p>Captain Jacobus La Grange died in February 1827 at the age of sixty-four. An obituary in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> called him "one of the oldest inhabitants of Albany." His will passed probate at the end of the month!</p>
