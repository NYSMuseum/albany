<strong>Alida Lansing</strong></a> was born in July 1685. She was the daughter of <a href="hglansing3350.html">Hendrick G.</a> and Elizabeth Caspers Lansing. Although her marriage license later would state that she had been born in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Colonie</a>, Alida grew up in a <a href="../../census1697.html#029">mainline</a> trader's home located in the heart of Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In December 1708, she married <a href="../f/isfonda3760.html">Isaac D. Fonda</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1723, eight children had been christened in Albany where both parents were regular baptism sponsors. Seven of those children lived to marry and raise their own families - further articulating the family web.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3100">1709</a>, she was identified as the owner of property in the first ward with her sister Jannetje. However, her household was a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> landmark and her husband a businessman and civic leader for several decades. 

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources reveal that Alida Lansing Fonda died in March 1748. Her husband died about that time as well.</p>
