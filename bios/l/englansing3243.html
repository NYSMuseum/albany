          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Engeltie Lansing</B></A> was born in 1690, the fifth 
            child of the marriage of Albany trader <a href="jolansing3440.html">Jan 
            Lansing</a> and the widow Geertruy Van Schaick Coster. Their home 
            on Pearl Street was filled with children from her mother's two families.</P>

          <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/englansing.jpg" width=175 height=230 align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Engeltie Lansing Wendell - 1718"></a> 
          <p>In December 1710, the twenty-year-old Engeltie married <a href="../w/evwendell2657.html">Evert 
            Wendell</a> - a twenty-nine-year-old emerging businessman and attorney. 
            The couple made their home in the Wendell house on upper State Street. 
            Between 1711 and 1734, ten children were born to this <a href="../../familynames.html">mainline 
            Albany family</a>. Five of those children were still living in 1749 
            to further establish the Wendell family and its <a href="lansing.html">Lansing</a> 
            roots in Albany annals. 
          <p>

          <P>Engeltie Wendell managed the domestic side of one of the most successful early 
            Albany families. However, when Evert Wendell made out his <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2657.html">will</a> 
            in 1749, he detailed the division of his extensive estate among his 
            children but <a href="#wife">scarcely mentioned</a> his wife. Curiously, 
            the only references to Engeltie came in enjoining his son Philip against 
            selling certain property while "my wife is living" and in leaving 
            all his negroes to his son Abraham "after my wife's decease." Also, 
            he made his son Abraham and daughter Engeltie co-executors of the 
            estate - perhaps pointing to some deficiency in his fifty-nine-year 
            old wife's condition.</P>

<p>Evert Wendell died in 1750. Afterwards, Engeltie was identified as a <a href="../../census1756.html#10">householder</a> and sometimes referred to as an"Indian Trader," one of the enterprises of her late husband. She lived in their house with her children for the next two decades. Engeltie Lansing Wendell died on November 18, 1769 and was "buried beside her husband."</p>
