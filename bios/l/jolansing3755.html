<p><b>John Lansing, </b><a href="#Jr."><b>Jr.</b></a> was born in 1754 the eldest son of <a href="gejalansing3705.html">Gerrit J. Lansing</a> and <a href="../w/jawaters465.html">Jane Waters</a>. Coming of age at the outbeak of hostilities with the British, his rise was more accelerated than it might have been during more peaceful times.</p>

          
      <p><a href="#JL"><img SRC="../../images/jpg/john.jpg" ALT="John Lansing, Jr." VSPACE=4 HSPACE=4 BORDER=1 height=150 width=145 align=right></a>As 
        a teenager, he clerked in the law office of <a href="../y/ryates.html">Robert 
        Yates</a>. He also may have clerked for James Duane in New York City. 
        In 1775, he was admitted to practice law. However, a budding career was 
        cut short by the outbreak of war. Commissioned an ensign in the Continental 
        army, in 1776, he served as military secretary to General <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
        Schuyler</a>. In the years that followed, he continued to serve the American 
        cause - but in civil capacities - following his patrons, the Yateses, 
        in the politcal revolution and then into the new State government.</p>
  
<p>Lansing was elected to the New York State Assembly at age twenty-six. He served in the legislature in 1780-84, 1786, and 1788-89. In 1786 and 1789, he was Assembly speaker. In 1786, he was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany - serving at City Hall until 1790.</p>

          <p> In 1787, Mayor Lansing was sent with <a href="../y/ryates.html">Robert Yates</a> 
            and Alexander Hamilton to represent New York at the Constitutional 
            Convention in Philadelphia. Unsure of their mandate to participate 
            in the drafting of an entirely new form of government, Yates and Lansing 
            returned home after a month. A contemporary provides us with a <a href="#pierce">capsule</a> of his personality. Like Yates, he later wrote a <a href="#JLN">history</a> 
            of the proceedings. At that time, he was still serving as mayor and 
            also building a large, new home that would become a <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2"> Market Street</a> landmark. In 1800, his <a href="../../census1800.html#3755">household</a> included seven children and three slaves.</p> 

<p>John Lansing, Jr. had married Manhattan refugee <a href="../r/cray6944.html">Cornelia Ray</a>  in 1781. Their ten children were born between 1783 and 1800. However, neither of his sons lived to raise a family. 

<p>Although his family and career was <a href="../../census1790.html#3755">based</a> in <a href="../../census1800.html#3755">Albany</a> and New York, Lansing used his status and connections to acquire considerable lands across the river and deep into the Schoharie Valley - where he built a country <a href="http://www.bcnys.org/album/pages/Lansing-Manor_jpg.htm">seat</a> for his daughter and son-in-law in 1819 called "<a href="http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=11892">Lansing Manor</a>."</p>  

<p>He served on the New York State Supreme Court from 1790 to 1801 - the last 
        year as chief justice following the death of Robert Yates. <a href="#JL2"><img SRC="../../images/jpg/jolansing2.jpg" vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="John Lansing, Jr." align=right border=1 height=200 width=150></a>In 
        1801, he was appointed chancellor of New York State. He held that office 
        until 1814 when he reached the mandatory retirement age of sixty! In retirement, 
        he continued to serve a lucritive legal clientele. In 1817 he was appointed 
        a regent of the University of the State of New York. As late as 1824, 
        he unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Albany.</p>

<p>Primarily an officeholder and attorney, Chancellor Lansing was involved in numerous and diverse civic ventures including the Albany Library, Albany Waterworks, Albany and Deleware Turnpike Company, Albany Academy, the Albany Lancaster School, 

<p>On the evening of December 12, 1829, he left his Manhattan hotel reportedly to mail a letter. He never was seen again. Chancellor Lansing was 75 years old and was presumed drowned or murdered. A <a href="http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/NY/AL.html#R9T0WRLC5">cenotaph</a> (empty tomb) was erected at Albany Rural Cemetery. His widow died in 1834. </p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of John <a href="lansing.html">Lansing</a>, Jr. is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 3755. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="lansing.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. <a name="Jr.">The 
        son of Gerrit Lansing, he was called "<b>Junior</b>" to prevent confusion 
        with at least one other John G. Lansing. A number of biographical profiles 
        appear <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibit_hall/charters_of_freedom/constitution/new_york.html#Lansing">online</a>.</p>

<a name=pierce>Fellow delegate <b>William Pierce</b> of Georgia provided <a href="http://www.usconstitution.net/constframe.html">short character sketches</a> of his contemporaries:  "Mr. Lansing is a practising Attorney at Albany, and Mayor of that Corporation. He has a hesitation in his speech, that will prevent his being an Orator of any eminence; - his legal knowledge I am told is not extensive, nor his education a good one. He is however a Man of good sense, plain in his manners, and sincere in his friendships. He is about 32 years of age."</p>


<p><a name="JL"></a>Chancellor Lansing commissioned several <b>portraits</b>. This one from the earlier part of his career appeared unattributed on an Internet website. Unfortunately, that page has vanished!</p>

<p><a name="JLN"></a>That work is most accessible in <i>The Delegate From New York or Proceedings of the Federal Convention of 1787,</i> (from the notes of John Lansing, Jr.), edited by Joseph Reese Strayer (Princeton, NJ, 1939).</p>
