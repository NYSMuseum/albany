<P>A <a href="#sources"> <strong>Margaret Lynott</strong></a> was identified in the <a href="../../wills/willthlynott.html">will </a>of one-time Albany resident <a href="thlynott1147.html">Thomas Lynott</a> filed in 1769. <a href="../../res/guess.html">P</a>erhaps, the subject of this sketch was the testator's daughter.

<p><a href="../../res/guess.html">If</a> so, along with her older sister, <a href="ellynott.html">Elizabeth</a>, she would have grown up in the Albany home of <a href="../b/abbgd7351.html">Abraham Bloodgood</a>, her step-father who would father at least seven more children with the widow Lynott.

<p>In July 1793, Margaret and her sister <a href="http://www.dcnyhistory.org/deedsbookA.html">sold</a> 400 acres of land in "Lynotsville" to a buyer  in Otsego County. At that time, she was identified as a resident of the city of Albany. In 1796, she was among those left bequests of land "north of the Mohawk" in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ERk8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=%22margaret+lynott%22+spinster&source=bl&ots=ea9n2d92aL&sig=IvfDbVfo7-wcM3Bejd1dpXlpVWQ&hl=en&ei=wVeUTq-vK8bd0QGC_NDGBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22margaret%20lynott%22%20spinster&f=false">will</a> filed John Kelly of New York. At that time, she was identified as the "spinster" daughter of Thomas Lynott. 

<p>In November 1797, Margaret married newcomer silversmith <a href="../h/ishutton.html">Isaac Hutton</a>. Over the next decade, their children were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. A son christened in 1798, was named "Abraham Bloodgood Hutton" after her stepfather. In that year, Margaret joined the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>For a decade, these Huttons seem to have lived under a larger family umbrella. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, their third ward household on lower  <a href="../../streets.html#columbia"> Columbia Street</a> included nine family members and three others.

<p>Elizabeth seems to have died by the time her widowed mother filed a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> in 1822. We seek defining information on the later life and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a> of Margaret Lynott Hutton. Isaac Hutton survived until 1855.</p>
