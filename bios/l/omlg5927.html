<P>According to family information, <a href="#sources"><b>Omie La Grange</b></a> was born in Normandy France about 1625 and emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> about 1656. A decade later he became a resident of Albany.</p>


<p>By that time, he had married <a href="../d/andevries7859.html">Anna De Vries</a>. The marriage produced many children (including five surviving sons) who further established the La Grange family in Albany in greater New York. He was an occassional baptism sponsor at the Albany Dutch church.</p>

<p>He was characterized as a "master tailor." In 1665, he began to acquire Albany <a href="#re">property</a> when he purchased a house from <a href="../vd/crvdam6352.html">Claes Ripse Van Dam</a>. In <a href="../../census1679.html#5927">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. He owned other Albany properties as well. Previously, he had purchased land on the Normanskill. He added to those holdings ultimately becoming the La Grange farm and sawmill in today's <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>.</p>

<p>In 1716, he became a <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> British subject. In 1720, he may be the "Omie" listed among the qualified voters of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.

<p>Omie La Grange died on April 26, 1731. He was buried at the Normanskill. <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>  burial records noted his burial and that he was about 106-years-old!</p>
