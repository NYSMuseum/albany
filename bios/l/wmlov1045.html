<strong>William Loveridge</strong></a> probably was an Englishman who was living in Albany as early as 1670. He was known in the community as a <a href="../../trades/hatter.html">hatter</a>.


<p>His wife's name was Temperance. They had at least two sons and five daughters who lived until maturity. Albany resident <a href="wmlov1042.html">William Jr.</a> followed his father in the hatmaker's trade.

<p>In 1671, Albany <a href="../../sources.html#era">records</a> identified him as a "master hatter." In <a href="../../census1679.html#1045">1679</a>, his name was listed above his son on a census of Albany householders. During the 1670s, he bought and sold lots on the Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market. 


<p>He also owned land south of Catskill in what became known as the "Loveridge Patent" of 1682. Apparently, it was confirmed in 1686 - after the death of its namesake.

<p>William Loveridge filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmlov1045.html">will</a> in January 1684. He died before June 3 when the will passed probate.</p>
