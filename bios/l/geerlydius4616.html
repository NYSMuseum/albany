<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Geertruy Isabella Lydius</strong></a> was born in Europe about 1695. She was the daughter of Dominie <a href="jlydius4614.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../r/irlydius4613.html">Isabella Rachels</a> Lydius who came to America in 1700 to serve at the Dutch <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> in Albany. She grew up in a <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">landmark house</a> occupied by her father in the heart of the community. Her father died in 1709 when she was fourteen and her mother re-married. In February 1716, she became a <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> British subject. 

<p>She married Dr. <a href="../r/jaroseboom1665.html">Jacob Roseboom</a> in August 1716. Five months later the first of their four children was christened in the Albany church where she was a member and baptism sponsor.

<p>These Rosebooms lived in Albany's first ward - near her childhood home that subsequently was occupied by her <a href="jhlydius4615.html">brother</a>.
   
<p>Geertruy Isabella Lydius Roseboom died in July 1757. Her husband lived for another decade.
