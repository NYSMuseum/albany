<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Gerritje Lansing</strong></a> was born in November 1748. She was the last child born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="gelansing3703.html">Gerrit I.</a> and <a href="../b/arbeekman3881.html">Ariaantie Beekman</a> Lansing. Her father died just before her birth leaving Ariaantie a widow and Albany householder for many decades thereafter.

<p>In July 1767, Gertie was not yet eighteen when she married Albany native <a href="../b/jobradt4256.html">John E. Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The following March, their only child was christened in Albany. In 1766, the "daughter in law of <a href="../b/egbradt4347.html">Egbert Bradt</a>" was assessed at the rate of one pound. In any event, John Bradt did not live much beyond their wedding.
  
      <p>In March 1779, the thirty-one-year-old widow married newcomer <a href="../w/bewashburn6816.html">Bethuel 
        Washburn</a> - New England-born boarder and associate of her late father-in-law. 
        Over the next decade, at least two of their children were christened at 
        her Albany church where she was a member and pewholder for many years. 
      <p>Bethuel Washburn filed a <a href="../../wills/willbewashburn.html">will</a> in April 1790. It named "Garritie" as co-executor. He was dead before the census was taken and Gerritje Washburn was accounted for in the <a href="../../census1790.html#3881">household</a> of her mother. Her first ward house and lot were configured on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment roll</a> for 1799. A year later, the <a href="../../census1800.html#3310">census</a> configured the household of "Gertrude Washburn" with four children in addition to the aging widow.
	  
      <p>Late in January 1807, "Garritie Washburn" and two married sisters signed a 
        <a href=#deed>document</a> completing a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">deed</a> 
        transaction for which they received "money" for an unspecified property 
        [Presumably in Saratoga County]. Thus, Gerritje Lansing Bradt Washburn 
        died sometime afterward.</p>
