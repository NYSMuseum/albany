<P>This<a href="#sources"> <strong>Andrew Lightbody</strong></a> was born about 1789. Subsequent sources noted that he was a native of Egremont, Massachusetts. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. He may have been the son of <a hreff="#john">J</a>ohn Lightbody whose household was configured on the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~maberksh/census/1790/egremont.htm?cj=1&netid=cj&o_xid=0002703009&o_lid=0002703009&o_sch=Affiliate+External">census</a> for Egremont in 1790. Perhaps, Andrew was a kinsman of <a href="jalightbody.html">James Lightbody</a>, the Albany jailer in 1800 and afterwards.



<p>At least by 1813, he was a communicant of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>Beginning in 1814, he was identified in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as a clerk living at 43 Church Street. By <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&new=1&MSAV=1&msT=1&gss=angs-g&gsfn=andrew&gsln=lightbody&msypn__ftp=albany&cpxt=0&catBucket=rstp&uidh=9w2&cp=0&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=1296856&recoff=9+10&db=biodat&indiv=1">1821</a>, his residence was listed at 38 Lydius Street and his store at 11 Hudson. He was identified as a leather dealer. 

<p>In <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&new=1&MSAV=1&msT=1&gss=angs-g&gsfn=andrew&gsln=lightbody&msypn__ftp=albany&cpxt=0&catBucket=rstp&uidh=9w2&cp=0&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=560840&recoff=8+9&db=1820usfedcenancestry&indiv=1">1820</a>, his household was configured on the Albany census. At that time, six people including a male over 45 and a woman 26-44, were counted under his name. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=%22andrew+lightbody%22+dead&source=bl&ots=xs4xcny_6V&sig=_BlPo7tSvzkxQ-ne2yfub8OTDoM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IisdUe4376vQAZbjgOgJ&ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20lightbody%22%20dead&f=false">July 1820</a>, the newspaper reported that the recently deceased <a href="../g/heguest8287.html">Henry Guest</a> had transferred his share of a leather store and factory located on the corner of Lydius and Church Streets to Andrew Lightbody, his younger partner. </p>
 
<p>In July <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qSoWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR263&lpg=PR263&dq=%22andrew+lightbody%22+albany&source=bl&ots=JZPB0sRw_r&sig=gs6Bs_0LJPY2n6BZQpVxAKBSjk0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PhMdUdiHEIf-0gHtxYG4DQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22andrew%20lightbody%22%20albany&f=false">1826</a>, his name apeared on a petition to Congress by a group of interested citizens making the case for the establishment of a branch of the United States Bank in Albany.

<p>In <a href="http://fultonhistory.com/newspapers%20Disk3/Albany%20NY%20Evening%20Journal/Albany%20NY%20Evening%20Journal%201830%20pdf/Albany%20NY%20Evening%20Journal%201830%20-%200097.pdf">1830</a>, he began a new partnership in the leather business to be located in his store on the corner of Hudson and Dean Streets.

If so, he was a native of Egremont, Massachusetts, lived at 31 Grand Street and died of old age. That individual was living there in <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&r=an&dbid=2469&iid=2125203&fn=Andrew&ln=Lightbody&st=r&ssrc=&pid=109442561">1861</a>.
