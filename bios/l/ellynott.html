<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Lynott</b></a> was named in the <a href="../../wills/willthlynott.html">will</a> filed by her father in 1769. At that time, <a href="thlynott1147.html">Thomas</a> and <a href="../vv/elvvlk1227.html">Elizabeth Van Valkenburgh</a> Lynott were living in "Potamocassock" in Albany County. Previously, they had lived in Albany. Her father had stipulated that Elizabeth was to be supported while a minor, paid £400 when she was "of age," and was to share the remaining estate with her <a href="mgtlynott.html">sister</a>.
		
<p>In 1773, following the death of Thomas Lynott, her mother re-married, bore seven more children, who with Elizabeth and Margaret Lynott, lived in the Albany home of her stepfather, skipper <a href="../b/abbgd7351.html">Abraham Bloodgood</a>.</p>

<p>In October 1789, Elizabeth married reknowned cartographer <a href="../d/sdewitt.html">Simeon De Witt</a> at St. Peter's Church. The couple made their <a href="../../census1790.html#dewitt">home</a> on Court Street. However, the marriage was shortlived. After bearing two children, Elizabeth died in December 1793. Her famous husband married two more times and lived until 1834.</p>
