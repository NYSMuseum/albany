      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Morgan Lewis</b></a> was born in New York City 
        in 1754. He was the son of Welshman and Declaration of Independence signer 
        <a href="http://www.colonialhall.com/lewis/lewis.asp">Francis Lewis</a> 
        and his wife, Elizabeth Annesley. He graduated from the College of New 
        Jersey in 1773 and intended to study for the ministry. However, he followed 
        his father's advice and prepared for a legal career.</p>
      <p>After serving in the militia, he joined the Continental army - serving 
        throughout the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war</a> in the Quartermaster's 
        Department. During that time he was stationed in Albany where he <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html">employed</a> 
        a number of clerks, assistants, and other field personnel. Many Albany 
        men and boys <a href="../../or/or-as.html">served</a> under his comand.</p>
      <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/morlewis.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4  alt="Morgan Lewis" width=200></a>While 
        in Albany, he boarded at the riverside home of <a href="../b/jabgd7354.html">James 
        Bloodgood</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3898">1779</a>, 
        the tax list showed him living there with personal property valued at 
        $2,000 - one of the highest assessments in the city. Later, he qualified 
        for a "<a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a>" as a member of 
        the city regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. 
        During that time, he acquired some Albany property. But in 1788, his lot 
        was taken back by the city government for failure to pay back rents.</p>
      <p>Lewis married Gertrude Livingston in 1779. After the war, they lived 
        in Rhinebeck and then in Hyde Park. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, 
        his Rhinebeck household was served by eight slaves.</p>
      <p>He was a member of the New York State Assembly (1789-92); Attorney General 
        (1791-92); justice and chief justice of the New York State Supreme Court 
        (1792-1801). He later served in the New York State Senate.</p>
      <p>He was governor of New York from 1804-1807 and maintained an Albany residence 
        during that time.</p>
      <p>During the War of 1812, he served as <a href="http://www.qmfound.com/BG_Morgan_Lewis.htm">Quartermaster 
        General</a> of the American army. 
      <p>At different times, while he was in Albany, he called on fellow Masons 
        at their <a href="../../org/masonic.html">lodge</a>.</p>
      <p>Morgan Lewis died in New York City in 1844. Lewis County is named for 
        him!</p>
