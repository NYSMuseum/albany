<P><A href="#biography"><B>Robert Lansing</B></A> was born in Albany in January 1707. He was the second son of contractor/merchant <a href="joglansing2051.html">Johannes G. Lansing</a> and one of the five children born to <a href="../s/hesanders1421.html">Helena Sanders</a> - daughter of a long-standing, Scottish-ancestry New York family. Named for grandfather Robert Sanders, he was <a href="rwlansing.html">not</a> the only surviving early Albany Lansing to be named "Robert."</p>

<p>Robert Lansing grew up in Albany and followed his father in community-based activities that frequently included service to the city government. He married three times: First, in 1734, to gunsmith's daughter <a href="../r/mgtroseboom1943.html">Margarita Roseboom</a> - a union that lasted through four children to her death 
            in 1746. He then married Albany native Sara Van Schaick - with one 
            daughter born before Sara's death a few years later. And in 1752, 
            he wed Catharina Ten Broeck - a daughter of the Roelof Jansen Kil 
            Ten Broecks and the thirty-year-old widow of Ephraim Van Vechten. 
            Robert was forty-five and his third marriage lasted until Catharina's 
            death in 1753. Of his six children, only <a href="hrlansing3392.html">Hendrick</a>, 
            the son of Robert's first marriage, and his older sister, <a href="malansing3503.html">Maria</a>, lived to reach adulthood.</p>

          <p>Robert Lansing followed the trade of the Rosebooms to become a gunsmith. He 
            was colonial Albany's most prominent practicioner - training a number 
            of <a href="../../makers.html">traditional tinkerers</a> over his 
            long career. By mid-century he had set up his house/shop on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court 
            Street</a> across from City Hall where the <a href="../../loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> 
            flowed through his back yard.</p>

          <p>Serving first as a constable, Robert followed his father to be elected assistant 
            alderman for the first ward - serving from 1739 to 1743. He also was 
            a frequent contractor of the city. In 1743, he was appointed "sealer 
            and stamper of weights and measurements." That year he was placed 
            in charge of Albany's first <a href="../../fire.html">fire engine</a>. Assisted 
            by his <a href="hrlansing3392.html">son and protege</a>, Robert 
            Lansing was responsible for Albany's pumpers for the next fifty years. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3656">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3656">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.</p>

<p>In 1775, Robert Lansing was almost sixty years old and was more dependant on Henry R. Lansing in his trade, his municipal responsibilities, and also for personal support. Still nominally in charge of the Albany fire engines, in 1777 he was asked to muster a fire company and to assign necessary tasks. He also was called on by the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Safety</a> to repair guns and appraise confiscated weapons.

<p>In 1788, he joined his son and a number of local men in <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#3656">signing</a> a statement issued by the Albany Antifederal Committee.  

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#3656">1790</a>, old Robert Lansing was living in the Court Street house attended by his son and grandchildren. This Albany mainstay died in March 1795 at age eighty-eight and was buried in the Dutch Church cemetery.</P>
