<P>Uniquely named <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham D. Lansing</strong></a> was an Albany resident until his death in 1805. Although most likely connected to the larger <a href="lansing.html">Lansing</a> family<a href="#*">*</a>, we have yet to define his specific <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>. Known as "Abraham D. Lansing" consistently in the community-based record, his middle initial <a href="../../res/guess.html">may</a> connect him to the <a href="../d/douw.html">Douws</a> as well. That said, New Jersey-based <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=wolphert&id=I248625">sources</a> have called him "Abraham Douw Lansing" and tell us that he was born to Albany area parents in 1775. At this point, we <a href="../qqqq.html">reserve</a> definite assignment of such information to this individual - mostly because doing so would make him a father and husband during his mid-teens. 

<p>In August 1791, he <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/church/flatbush_mar1.shtml">married</a> "Miss" <a href="../v/chvoor.html">Christina Voorhees</a> in New Brunswick, New Jersey but under the auspices of the Flatbush Reformed Church in Kings County (Brooklyn). <a href="../qqqq.html">If</a> family-based sources are correct, the couple may have been in their mid-teens at that time.

<p><a name=events></a>In March 1792, the couple <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1PAEzZId9fMC&pg=RA7-PA30&lpg=RA7-PA30&dq=%22abraham+d+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=fJYMU7NG5I&sig=DYtcNAMIEGawDlwjDEifqgcp5qU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bWeRT_GREKPE6QHhmY3_Aw&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20d%20lansing%22&f=false">witnessed</a> the baptism of daughter son of Abraham A. Lansing. Their <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=401716807184">daughter</a> was born in 1802 and lived at Cherry Hill after the death of her parents. Another daughter was christened at the Albany church in the spring of 1793.
 
<p>By that time, the young couple had made their home in Albany. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#abdl">1800</a>, the census configured Abraham D. Lansing's household home with two boys, two young men, and a young woman - fixing the ages of the adults as no older than twenty-six. A year earlier, the first ward <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment roll</a> valued his personal property between the Court Street houses of <a href="../b/jobogert6121.html">John Bogert</a> and <a href="ablansing3694.html">Abraham A. Lansing</a>.

<p>In 1803, he was <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york/military-minutes-of-the-council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york-1783-18-2nu/page-47-military-minutes-of-the-council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york-1783-18-2nu.shtml">promoted</a> to lieutenant in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>.

<p>In 1803, a voter list identified him as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html">merchant</a>.

<p>In 1803 <a href="http://fultonhistory.com/newspaper%2010/Kingston%20NY%20Plebian%201803-1805/Kingston%20NY%20Plebian%201803-1805%20Grayscale/Kingston%20NY%20Plebian%201803-1805%20Grayscale%20-%200175.pdf">or</a> 1804, a Kingston newspaper reported that Abm. D. Lansing had submitted a bill to the state government for  $792 due for "rent and taxes on the house occupied by the <a href="../c/geoclinton.html">governor</a>."  
 
<p>On October 1, 1805, the <i>Albany Centennial</i> reported "Died on Saturday last, <a href="../h/sihowell.html">Silas Howel</a> and Abraham D. Lansing, merchants, of malignant fever." Traditional sources gave the cause of <a href="../../res/death.html">death</a> as "yellow fever." Letters of administration were granted on his estate on October 24.  </p>
