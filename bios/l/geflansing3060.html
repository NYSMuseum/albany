<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit Frederickse</b></a> was the father of the <a href="lansing.html">Lansing family</a> - the most numerous family group to live in early Albany. He may have been born in Hassel, the Netherlands about 1610. His wife was <a href="../h/elizhendrix.html">Elizabeth Hendrix</a> - the mother of six Lansing children. All of their children were born prior to thier move to America.

<p>He may have come to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> about 1640 and then returned to Holland. Or he may have lived out his days in America. He was identified as a baker - an enterprise that stayed with the family through subsequent generations!</p>

<p>Although sometimes confused with his <a href="geglansing3698.html">son</a> and namesake, Gerrit Frederickse was dead by October 1679. At that time, he was <a href="#id">identified</a> as "deceased" and "in his lifetime," a "burgher of Hassell." His widow had remarried and was living in <a href="../../census1679.html">Albany</a>. A more <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2001-03/0984094488">specific senario</a> fixes his death during the 1650s.</p>

<p>Through ten generations before <a href="../../criteria.html">1800</a>, his descendants constituted the largest early Albany family!</p>
