      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Lottridge</strong></a> or "Lotteridge" 
        was born during the 1740s. He probably was the kinsmen of Albany residents 
        <a href="rlottridge453.html">Richard/Robert</a> and <a href="thlottridge414.html">Thomas 
        Lottridge</a>. Frontier officer and Indian agent <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RvMLMAE1yWwC&pg=PA725&lpg=PA725&dq=%22john+lottridge%22&source=web&ots=UsDXduO_2K&sig=qEXkZYMc0qpSwwjb3at89TFC2zs#PPA409,M1">John 
        Lottridge</a> - who died in 1763, probably was their kinsman as well. 
<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#wl">1766</a>, his signature appeared on the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html">1767</a>, he was identified as a private in a city-based <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>In November 1767, he married Rensselaerswyck resident "<a href="../w/anweaver.html">Annaatjr de Wever</a>" (Weaver) at the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        Dutch church. Church records state that he was "from Albany." In 1777 and 1779, their children were christened at the 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. The marriage produced at least four additional children.  
      <p>Except for the couple witnessing baptisms together at the Albany church 
        in 1779 and 1786 and being <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#wmlo">listed</a> 
        among the creditors on an estate inventory dated 1793, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">n</a>ame 
        of William Lottridge has not been encountered in our ongoing sweep of 
        community-based resources. 
      <p><a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nychenan/lottrdgf.htm">P</a>erhaps 
        his son, John, came from Albany to settle in Chenango in 1799.</p>

        has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>.

        we are puzzled by our inability to find connecting demographics. </div>
