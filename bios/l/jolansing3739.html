<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Johannes <a href="lansing.html">Lansing</a>, Jr. is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 3739. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">profile</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="lansing.html#sources">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We seek defining information on his economic life and on his passing. At this point, our offering is cautious as we have accumulated a large store of qualitative information for a number of "Johannes Lansings" who were <a href="lansing.html#name">living</a> in and around Albany during his lifetime!</p>
