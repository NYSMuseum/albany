<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Lansing</strong></a> was born in 
        September 1748. He was the first son of <a href="jolansing3744.html">Johannes 
        Jac. Lansing</a> and his third wife <a href="../s/caschuyler1246.html">Catharina 
        Schuyler</a> Lansing. He grew up in a merchant's home on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market 
        Street</a> as his parents were Albany mainstays for more than fifty years. He seems to have been the sole Nicholas Lansing <a href="../../criteria.html">at risk</a>.
		
		      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his name was included 
        on the Albany assessment roll (along with some other taxable non real 
        property holders) but no tax amount was shown. 
      <p>In September 1779, he joined with his father and many other Albany people 
        in signing a <a href="../../doc/petvd1779.html">petition</a> to the governor 
        for the return of Dr. Henry VanDyck. 
      <p>After a number of years as a Hudson River sailor and skipper, at about 
        the age of thirty, he is said to have begun training for the ministry 
        under Albany domine <a href="../w/ewesterlo.html">Eilardius Westerlo</a>. 
      <p>During those years, he met the slightly older "<a href="http://www.thinkbabynames.com/meaning/0/Dorcas">D</a>orcas 
        Sarah Dickenson," a refugee from New York who had come to stay with the 
        domine's family in Albany. They are <a href="#note">said</a> to have been 
        married in 1784. Nicholas Lansing's marriage appears to have been childless. 
      <p>In August 1784, he accepted a call to serve the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=L0UVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22nicholas+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=9YHfmX2LPE&sig=Euuh1uR6VB85r4l1cJz-sULr13k&hl=en&ei=Oz4-SreOKKKxtgfEls2qBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2">Reformed 
        church</a> at Tappan in the lower Hudson Valley. He was installed in December 
        and served with distinction for many years. 
      <p>In 1790, his household was enumerated on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> 
        for Orange Town in Orange County. It included the couple and three slaves. 
      <p>His character and career are <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=L0UVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22nicholas+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=9YHfmX2LPE&sig=Euuh1uR6VB85r4l1cJz-sULr13k&hl=en&ei=Oz4-SreOKKKxtgfEls2qBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2">considered</a> 
        in depth in the published <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XCUVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA224&lpg=PA224&dq=%22nicholas+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=R5PMYVUhyo&sig=0IRtWXx26NzT-eAKEOa4Q3PL2ys&hl=en&ei=uM0_SsTHEZfcMLTD0JUP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2">history</a> of the Rockland County church. 
      <p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=L0UVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA74&dq=%22nicholas+lansing%22&source=bl&ots=9YHfmX2LPE&sig=Euuh1uR6VB85r4l1cJz-sULr13k&hl=en&ei=Oz4-SreOKKKxtgfEls2qBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2">P</a>erhaps, 
        his wife passed in 1814. Albany native Nicholas Lansing died at Tappan in 
        September 1835. He had lived eighty-seven years. He was among those called 
        "last of the old Dutch domines." Over the years, a number of children 
        were named in his honor. </p>
