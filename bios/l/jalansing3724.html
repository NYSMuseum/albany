<strong>Jacob Lansing, Jr.</strong></a> was born in July 1712. He was an older son in the large family of <a href="jalansing3477.html">Jacob G.</a> and <a href="../g/heglen4922.html">Helena Glen</a> Lansing. He grew up on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in the home of a prominent Albany silversmith and businessman. He was referred to as "Jacob J." or "Jacob Jr." or "Colonel Jacob Lansing" to help prevent confusion with a number of same-named contemporaries.

<p>In November 1742, Jacob J. was thirty when he married twenty-eight-year-old <a href="../e/maegberts4530.html">Maria Egberts</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1757, this union of Albany natives had produced nine children who were christened in his Albany church.

<p>He was a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#3724">merchant</a> whose home was on Market Street in the general <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany - probably beyond the northern city line where four Jacob Lansing-headed households were configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#3724">census</A> for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> in 1790.

<p>He served the American <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">cause</a> as Colonel of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. He led those soldiers at the Battles of Saratoga. Perhaps, this "Jacob Lansing" also was a member of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html"> Committee of Correspondence</a>.

<p>Jacob Lansing, Jr. lost his wife in 1771. He died in January 1791 at the age of seventy-six and was buried from his church.</p>
