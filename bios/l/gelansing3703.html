<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit I. Lansing</b></a> was born in December 1705. He was the first son born to Albany residents <a href="islansing3468.html">Isaac</a> and Jannetie Beekman Lansing. He grew up in his father's house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. However, he would wait much <a href="../../marriages.html#young">longer</a> than most Albany men before setting out on his own.</p>


<p>In March 1740, Gerrit was thirty-four years old when he married a much younger <a href="../b/arbeekman3881.html">Ariaantie Beekman</a>. By 1748, four children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>In 1732, he acquired land on the Plain in the first ward where these Lansings would establish their home. In 1747, the city placed a "great gun" opposite his house.</p>

<p>Gerrit I. Lansing died in October 1748 - shy of his forty-third birthday. His widow did not re-marry and lived for many decades with her sons in their first ward home.</p>
