<p>To our users/readers/browsers/viewers:

<p><dd>Stopgap explanation from <a href="staff/sbbio.html"><b>Stefan Bielinski</b></a>

<p><a href="#source">R</a>egrettably, you have been directed here because <a href="../res/inq.html">we</a> have not been able to move forward on a particular biography given the resources available at this time.

        <p>This condition has occurred as a <a href="../res/bios.html">historical 
          character</a> obviously (or otherwise) within the <a href="../criteria.html">criteria 
          for inclusion</a> has so far (but not totally) eluded our <a href="../guide/histres.html#dcp">overall 
          research effort</a> and also our sweep of <a href="../res/irs.html">Internet-based 
          resources</a> as of the date given on the bottom of the particular biographical 
          profile. In other words, the individual is officially "indefinable" 
          or seriously compromised - biographically speaking! That means, too 
          many essential questions still remain unanswered. 
        <p>However, in each case, we have shared what we know about an individual's life BUT do not feel that we can make appreciable progress at this time. Thus, we must move on as many many more historical characters await attention.

<p>A number (we are not saying how many - but it is too many) of the people of colonial Albany have been placed in this category and yet posted online. They have not been listed under the "<a href="../newfeatures.html">New Features</a>" calendar of items added. Eventually, all will be tagged with a link to this page.

<p><a name=one></a><font size=+2><b>One</b></font size>: Within our development of lifecourse biographies for the people of colonial Albany, the modifying term "<b>one</b>" has been used to state that we have not been able to define the subject demographically. Typically, it refers to a spouse who married a person who who fits our inclusion criteria and who was not born in Albany. We have retained the <a href="../res/sp.html">spelling</a> of that person's name as it appears in the source. Beginning in 2015, we have tried to qualify our inclusion of the subject by here stating that we do not have a clue as to his/her origins. We will retrofit existing offerings during their "normal" revision.

<p>We apologize for this predicament/situation/condition and are hopeful that we may move ahead on this particular part of the early Albany community mosaic before too long!

<p>Comments on this/these tactic are appreciated!</p>
