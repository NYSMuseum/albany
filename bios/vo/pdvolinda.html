<P><a href="#sources"><b>Pieter Danielse Van Olinda</b></a> was a farmer, tailor, and sometime <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a>. He <a href="#nat">probably</a> was born in Europe. He has been identified as one of the original patentees of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#5302">1674</a>, he was among those invited to the funeral of the director of Rensselaerswyck - where he held property.</p>

<p>By that time, he had become the husband of half-breed interpreter <a href="../vs/hivslyck.html">Hilletie Van Slyck</a>. He was the father of a number of her children including three sons who were still alive in 1715. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#011">1697</a>, Pieter Danielse was identified as an Albany householder. In 1701, he joined other Albany Protestants in a petition to the governor. He held no municipal offices and he was not identified as an Albany property holder on assessment rolls for the first decade of the eighteenth century.</p>  

Pieter Danielse filed a <a href="../../wills/willpivolinda.html">will</a> in August 1715. At that time, he noted that he was a tailor and was living in Rensselaerswyck. He owned a house just outside the <a href="../../loc/court.html">south gate</a> of the Albany stockade, leased land in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, held property near the Cohoes Falls, and also owned a lot on the flats above <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. Much of this real estate came to him through the work of his wife, the then late Hilletie Van Slyck!</p>

<p>Pieter Danielse Van Olinda died in 1716. After the passing of his sons, the surname was no longer found on Albany city rolls!</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Pieter Danielse Van Olinda is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 5302. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. He sometimes 
        was referred to as "Vanderlinde" or "Vanderlyn." He should not be confused 
        with Schenectady resident Pieter Danielse Van Antwerpen!</font></p><FONT size=-1>

<p><a name=nat></a>As he was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> in 1715, he probably was not born in America!</p>
