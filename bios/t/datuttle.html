<P>The household of <a href="#sources"> <strong>David Tuttle</strong></a> was configured on the Albany census of the first ward in <a href="../../census1800.html#datu">1800</a>. It counted a boy 10-16, a man over 45, a girl under ten, and a woman between 26 and 45. Thus, this individual was born prior to 1756. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Perhaps he had some connection to the older Albany loyalist <a href="sttuttle.html">Stephen Tuttle</a>.

<p>Several same-named contemporaries are at risk in the region and in <a href="http://www.geneajourney.com/tuttle.html">Connecticut</a> and <a href="https://archive.org/stream/ogdenfamilyiname00whee#page/64/mode/2up">New Jersey</a>. In addition, four households headed by men named David Tuttle were configured on the first Federal <a href="../../census1790.html">Census</a> in 1790 for Southold in Suffolk County. In 1800, one David Tuttle was named on the Southhold census.

<p>He probably <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=zvAUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=%22david+tuttle%22+albany&source=bl&ots=lR1PtYYGN-&sig=fG7MMNQE7SJ-k2yl0m66CI-SVY0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kQKXVOqBD_DbsASnkYHgBA&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22david%20tuttle%22%20albany&f=false">married</a> [nd] <a href="../w/mawalker.html">Mary Walker</a> of Ashford, CT? If so, they had at least six children. In that context, the individual was identified as a resident of Albany 

<p>In April 1798, David Tuttle was identified as a "victualer" on a list of potential jurors before the Albany <a href="../../org/mayorct.html">Mayor's Court</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the houselot and property of a "William Tuttle" was valued on the first ward assessment roll near the location of David Tuttle's household in 1800.

<p>This individual left a faint but distinct imprint on the community-based record in the years around 1800. Beyond that, we have not yet uncovered additional information for the one-time Albany resident named David Tuttle.</p>
