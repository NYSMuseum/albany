<P><A href="#biography"><B>Coenradt Ten Eyck</B></A> was born in 1678. He was the first son born to <a href="jacote4807.html">Jacob C.</a> and <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">Geertje Coeymans</a> Ten Eyck. Jacob was a shoemaker who moved to Albany after 1664 and established the Ten Eyck family in the upper Hudson region. Losing his father during his adolescence, Coenradt's path forward would come through service and hopefully lead to an apprenticeship.</P>

          <p>Coenradt Ten Eyck reached adulthood in the <a href="../../census1697.html#118">home</a> 
            of his widowed mother. By the early 1700s, he was identified as the 
            head of that <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household. 
            Trained by Cornelis Kierstede, he became a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a> and worked in Albany <a href="#and">and</a> 
            in New York City. Over the next half century, he cemented his Albany 
            ties serving as a constable (and high constable), juror, assessor, 
            and assistant alderman beginning in 1706. During these years, his home was 
<a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4812">valued</a> on city assessment rolls. In 1715, he belonged to an Albany-based <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">militia troop</a> During that time, this Albany 
            <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4812">mainstay</a> was active in 
            committee work, represented Albany in New York, managed municipal 
            projects, and performed contact work as far away as <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. In 1747, 
            he was living in the third ward and was elected alderman.</p>

          <P>Coenradt married Albany native <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje 
            Van Schaick</a> in 1704. Their ten children were baptized between 
            1705 and 1728 in the Albany Dutch church where both parents were members 
            and where Coenradt was a <a href="../../drc.html#deacons">church officer</a>.</P>
<p>In 1716, he was left a share of his widowed mother's <a href="../../wills/willgeercoey.html">estate</a> and was named co-executor.		
			
<p>Coenradt Ten Eyck died in January 1753 several months shy of his seventy-fifth 
            birthday. His wife lived on in their <a href="../../census1756.html#147">State 
            Street home</a> for several years. Eight of their children married 
            and extended the Ten Eyck name in the region for generations to come. 
            His son, <a href="jacte4881.html">Jacob C. Ten Eyck</a>, was named 
            mayor of Albany in 1748!</p>
