<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Tobias H. Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in August 1717. As the third son of <a href="hete4818.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/mgtbleecker210.html">Margarita Bleecker</a> Ten Eyck, he grew up in a Pearl Street home next to that of his grandmother, the <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">Ten Eyck matriarch</a>. He was known as "Tobias H. Ten Eyck" to distinguish him from a more Albany-based younger <a href="tote4907.html">cousin</a> and from younger same-named individuals as well.

<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/tote4830.jpg" align=left border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200></a>It seems that early on the young man had taken up residence in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. In September 1750, Tobias was living there when married Albany native <a href="../d/radep7828.html">Rachel De Peyster</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  By the mid-1760s, at least seven children had been christened in Schenectady.

<p>By that time, Tobias H. Ten Eyck was <a href="../../sources.html#uny">counted</a> among Schenectady's wealthiest businessmen and was identified with the other borough fathers at the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7RQCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22tobias+h+ten+eyck%22&source=bl&ots=6rT-N2EaZZ&sig=Lw59oNL-tmeS-cKyuwEeGqponeM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aImEUo2DILO64APD34GwAw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=snippet&q=tobias&f=false">establishment</a> of Schenectady in 1765. Two years earlier, he was counted among the principal <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4830">freeholders</a> of Albany County. He is <a href="http://townofesperance.org/history.asp">said</a> to have purchased the "Ten Eyck Patent" in 1769 which was located in the present town of Esperence.

<p>Fifty-eight in 1775, this subject lived conspicuously in Schenectady during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> - declining to serve as a member of the Schenectady <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> but receiving a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service afterwards. However, his wartime <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/hanson/revwar_q_t.html">exploits</a> are <a href="../../na/na.html">beyond</a> the scope of this sketch. A  middle son, <a href="jodpte4891.html">John De Peyster Ten Eyck</a>, was a prominent resident of Albany.

<p>Tobias H. Ten Eyck had filed a <a href="../../wills/willtote4830.html">will</a> in August of 1774. It named his wife and six sons as heirs. The will passed probate in Albany in May 1785 - following his death a few months earlier at age sixty-seven. He was <a href="../../res/ts.html">known</a> as "one of the wealthiest citizens of Schenectady." His widow then probably returned to Albany, survived until 1787, and was buried from the Albany church.
