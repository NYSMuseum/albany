      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerritje Ten Eyck</b></a> was born in August 1728. 
        She was the youngest daughter of Albany silversmith <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt 
        Ten Eyck</a> and his wife, <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje 
        Van Schaick</a>. Her much older brother, <a href="jacte4881.html">Jacob</a>, 
        was named mayor of Albany in 1748.</p>
		
<p>Howver, her parents had christened a <a href="gerrte.html">Gerritje</a> in 1710 and that girl appears to have survived (but without much notice) until her death in 1743.
		
      <p>In 1752, this younger Gerritje married <a href="../g/pegansevoort4670.html">Peter Gansevoort</a>, 
        a young Albany physician. By 1770, their ten children had been baptized 
        in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was 
        an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>
      <p>In 1754, she was <a href="../../wills/willsacoeymans.html">named</a> 
        to share in the estate of her uncle, Samuel Coeymans. 
      <p>This doctor's family lived on <a href="../../census1756.html#275">Market 
        Street</a> near Peter's extensive family. 
      <p>Gerritje Ten Eyck Gansevoort died in July 1782 - a month shy of her fifty-fourth 
        birthday. After that, her husband was absorbed in family households and 
        lived until 1809. </p>
