      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John C. Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born 
        in July 1740. He was the only son of the marriage of <a href="cotbroeck31.html">Cornelis</a> 
        and <a href="../c/macuyler596.html">Maria Cuyler</a> Ten Broeck. His father 
        was a businessman and community leader. This Johannes sometimes was known 
        as "John C. Ten Broeck" - probably to prevent confusion with his prominent 
        but aged city-based <a href="jotbroeck52.html">uncle</a> and also with 
        a slightly older Claverack-based, <a href="../../res/sp.html">but</a> 
        same-named <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qeZmAAAAMAAJ&pg=SL3-PA266&lpg=SL3-PA266&dq=%22john+c+ten+broeck%22&source=bl&ots=yQtFrrF0DT&sig=277VcXt_2LFtiS3J4-D9T8dYOUQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8S-NVfW4AoeqgwSm3ryICA&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22john%20c%20ten%20broeck%22&f=false">kinsmen</a>. 
      <p>In June 1762, John C. married Albany native <a href="../g/sagansevoort4672.html">Sara 
        Gansevoort</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor. The marriage produced 
        eleven children. But only three of them would live to raise their own 
        families. 
      <p>These Ten Broecks made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a> near the houses of their parents. His Albany property was valued 
        on every Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> 
        roll <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#55">until</a> after 1790. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>, he served as firemaster 
        for the third ward. From <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</A> to 
        1770 he was elected and re-elected assistant alderman. From <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a> 
        to the outbreak of hostilities, he was chosen annually as alderman for 
        the third ward. While on the city council, he was active in its deliberations 
        - particularly where they involved the Albany <a href="../../lastdays.html">waterfront</a>. 
      <p>During the 1760s, he had held commissions in the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html">Albany 
        company</a> of the county <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        - beginning a military career that matured during the next decades. In 
        <a href="../../solconst.html#56">1766</a>, he joined in signing a constitution 
        of the Albany Sons of Liberty. At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, 
        he was elected a member of the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> 
        representing the third ward. He served on the committee until mid-1777. 
        In 1776, he was appointed to the New York Provincial Congress. Throughout 
        the war, he maintained his militia commission. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1780">1780</a>, he was elected to his old 
        seat on the city council. He resigned the <a href="../../org/cc.html#1781">next 
        year</a> to become <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany 
        County. Throughout the 1780s, he served in one of those offices. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#55">1790</a>, his <a href="../../streets.html#market">home 
        </a> on the east side of Market Street was configured on the census. In 
        1792, he was elected to represent Albany in the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>. 
        In 1798 and in 1800, "John C. Ten Broeck" was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QZAwAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=%22john+c+ten+broeck%22+1800&source=bl&ots=qHytoFzBc0&sig=zIBJc4xHNo1whiNXvV4E13reY6E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_2CNVZfVCcm4-AGP1oGgBw&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20c%20ten%20broeck%22%201800&f=false">identified</a> 
        as "Grand Marshall" of a convention of the State Royal Arch Masons in 
        Albany. But before 1800, his name had dropped from Albany rolls. After 
        that, he probably moved south to Columbia or Ulster County.</p>

      <p>John C. Ten Broeck <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89066363458;view=1up;seq=172">died</a> 
        in December 1822 at the age of eighty-three. A newspaper obituary <a href="https://books.google.com/books?output=text&id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&q=dec.26&f=false">noted</a> 
        his passing: 
      <blockquote><font size=-1>Dec. 26. — John Ten Broeck died, aged 83. He was 
        one of the patriots of the revolution, and together with Abraham Yates, 
        formerly mayor of the city, were the last representatives under the colonial 
        government from the city and county of Albany. Mr. Ten Broeck was also 
        a member of the convention of this state, which in 1777, framed our constitution. 
        During the arduous struggle of the revolution he held several responsible 
        stations, and discharged the duties thereof with fidelity. After the organization 
        of our state government, he at different times received distinguished 
        marks of public confidence; and in every situation in which he was placed, 
        he acquitted himself as an upright and meritorious public servant.</font size></blockquote>
