<P><A  href="#sources"><strong>Geertruy Ten Broeck</strong></A> was born about 
        1670. She was the fifth of the <a href="tbvb.html">thirteen</a> children 
        born to Albany founders <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> 
        and <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">Christina Van Buren</a> Ten Broeck. 
        She grew up in a landmark home on Albany's main street from where her 
        father conducted his multifaceted business.</P>

<P>In November 1691, she married <a href="../s/abschuyler921.html">Abraham Schuyler</a>, a son of Albany's most prominent <a href="../s/dapschuyler1262.html">New Netherland</a> family. Their five children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1692 and 1707 where both parents were members.</P>

<p>These Schuylers set up their home on "Brewers" (<a  href="../../streets.html#market">Market</a>) Street in what Abraham Schuyler later would call a "little house on the street." He was a fur trader, city official, and frequently was in the Indian country on diplomatic business. He died in the Seneca country after an illness in 1726.

<p>Her father's <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">will</a> was probated in 1718 and the subsequent partition of the estate left her with substantial assets.

<p>By virtue of the <a href="../../wills/willabschuyler921.html">will</a> Abraham had filed in 1709, Geertruy inherited all of his substantial property as well. In 1736, she transferred some land. Perhaps she was still alive in <a href="../../census1756.html#278">1756</A> and living next door to her son <a href="../s/daaschuyler1265.html">David A. Schuyler</a>. However, <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources say that she had died in New York in 1738.

<p>We still <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> definitive information on the later life and passing of Geertruy Ten Broeck Schuyler.</p>
