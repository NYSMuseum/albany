<strong>Christina Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in November 1729. She was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="satbroeck79.html">Samuel</a> and <a href="../vr/mavr5096.html">Maria Van Rensselaer</a> Ten Broeck. Her parents had Albany roots but made their life on a farm on the Roeloff Jansen Kil at Claverack.

<p>Named for her <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">grandmother</a>, the <a href="tbroeck.html">Ten Broeck</a> family matriarch, she was one of several <a href="../bioindex.html#t">prominent</a> "Christina Ten Broecks" living in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> at that time.

<p>In September 1754, she married <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> native <a href="../s/harschuyler.html">Harmanus Schuyler</a>. By 1771, she had given birth to nine children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member, pewholder, and baptism sponsor.

<p>Harmanus Schuyler was a silversmith and businessman who set up his family in a corner house on Albany's <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">main interesection</a>. After a decade as sheriff, he left Albany and entered the lumbering business - establishing his family in their new home at Stillwater. In 1778, his landmark Albany home was sold to newcomer <a href="../r/jorobison422.html">John Robison</a>.

<p>After the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, these Schuylers returned to their normal life in Stillwater. Harmanus Schuyler died in 1796. Perhaps Christina Ten Broeck Schuyler survived him. At the same time, she might well have passed on at any time following the birth of her last child in 1771. </p>
