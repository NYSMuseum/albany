<strong>Magdalena Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in May 1765. She was the eldest surviving daughter of <a href="jotbroeck55.html">John C.</a> and <a href="../g/sagansevoort4672.html">Sara Gansevoort</a> Ten Broeck. She grew up in a large family (11 births) in the Market Street <a href="../../census1790.html#55">home</a> of an Albany mainstay. However, she was destined to be the only one of John C.'s three surviving children to raise a family of their own.

<p>In October 1786, she married newcomer <a href="../g/thvwgraham8215.html">Theodorus Van Wyck Graham</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Beginning in 1787, their children were christened at the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a> where both parents were lifelong members.

<p>After initially <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8215">settling</a> in the upper part of the first ward, these Grahams made their <a href="../../census1790.html#8215">home</a> on Market Street where Theodorus and Magdalena were Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%22Graham+T. V. W.%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22Graham%20T.V.W.%22&f=false">mainstays</a> at what became 225 North Market Street for many years.

<p>Theodorus was a prominent attorney, officeholder, and landowner. During the 1790s, both her father and husband represented Albany in the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html#nys">Assembly</a>. 

<p>Magdalena Ten Broeck Graham lost her husband in 1822. By that time, her name had dropped from Albany rolls. She probably left the city following Graham's death. On March 13, 1843, the Albany newspaper reported that Magdalena had <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA338&lpg=PA3838dq=%22March%2013%22&ffalse">died</a> at the age of seventy-seven. We seek infomation on her later life and passing.
