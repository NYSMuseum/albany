<strong>Abraham Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in December 1743. He was the son of Albany leaders <a href="jacte4881.html">Jacob C.</a> and <a href="../c/cacuyler371.html">Catharina Cuyler</a> Ten Eyck.

<p>In April 1769, he married <a href="../l/anlansing3158.html">Anna Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1790, nine children were christened at the Albany church where he was a baptism sponsor, pewholder, and church <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">officer</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, he was first elected assistant alderman. He held a seat on the city council and was an active member for more than a decade. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1783">1783</a>, he was identified as the Albany treasurer. <a href="../../org/cc.html#1793">Later</a>, he was elected alderman for the first ward. 


<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#4808">1766</a>, he joined with a number of Albany men in signing a document protesting the Stamp Act. In 1776, he <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">signed</a> the General Association and was elected to serve on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. Over the next years, he was active in committee business. In 1777, he was called "paymaster" and "treasurer" of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia regiment</a>. He also <a href="../../inprog.html">may have</a> served more actively as a militia officer.

<p>After the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, he was involved in a number of civic and municipal ventures and in the development of a "Glass Works" located beyond Albany. Lottery manager, turnpike commissioner, and subscriber and investor are among his credits.
 

<p>By the late 1770s, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">holdings</a> in the third and first wards were regularly found on city assessment rolls. The census in <a href="../../census1790.html#4808">1790</a> configured his riverside home. Subsequent city <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4808">survey documents</a> show that he was a slaveholder with additional lots on <a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay Street</a>, on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>, and along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.

After 1810, his name no longer appeared on Albany rolls. Perhaps, his household was absorbed under one of <a href="../../na/whitehall.html">those</a> of his children. During these years, he ran for the State Assembly and was among those who acted as pallbearers at the re-interrment of General Montgomery in 1818.
 
<p>Abraham Ten Eyck lost his wife in January 1823. He died in October 1824 at the age of eighty. The following January, letters of administration were issued on his estate.</p>
