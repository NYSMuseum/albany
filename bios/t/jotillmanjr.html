<strong>John Tillman, Jr.</strong></a> was born during the 1740s. He was the eldest son of German emigres <a href="jotillman.html">John</a> and Margaret Tillman. He came to New York with his parents. He was called "John Tillman, Jr."

<p>By the 1760s, his family had settled in the area <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> of Albany that would be called <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>Early in <a href="../../solconst.html#jtjr">1766</a>, John Tillman, Jr. checked in to the community when he joined in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. 
 
<p>In August 1767, he married Mary Barbara Bauer (Powers). The marriage produced at least one son and also daughters who would marry <a href="eltillman2133.html">pr</a>ominent Albany residents. These Tillmans were said to have been connected with the <a href="../../drc.html#grc">German Reformed Church</a>.

<p>He was known as a sailor/captain - perhaps in association with his uncles. He worked for his father in procuring <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanned</a> animal hides. Like his father, he also performed tasks for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. In November 1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#jtjr">exempted</a> from military service along with older community members and those younger men who were available but actively employed in the war effort on the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">homefront</a>. In 1782, the Albany municipal government paid him to carry messages to Governor Clinton and General William Heath.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1790.html#jtjr">1790</a> and 1800, his name appeared on the Watervliet census. In 1797, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/hatter.html">hatter</a> and as an Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">freeholder</a>. In 1820, the household of "John Tillman" was configured on the Albany census. However, his name did not appear in Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a>.

<p>The Albany newspapers noted that former resident John Tillman. Jr. died in Geneva, New York in June 1822 and that he had lived seventy-six years.
