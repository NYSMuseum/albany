          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Anna Margarita Ten Eyck</B></A> was born in 1721. 
            She was the daughter of Albany silversmith <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt 
            Ten Eyck</a> and <a href="../vs\gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje Van 
            Schaick</a>. The eighth of ten children, younger daughters sometimes 
            did not marry - or they <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> 
            much later than the norm.</p>

<p>Anna Margarita fit this pattern. Not until after her fifty-first birthday did she wed widower <a href="../b/jobarclay.html">John Barclay</a> in September 1771. The new couple set up their Albany home in one of her family's houses on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a>.

<p>In March 1761, "Anna Margreta Ten Eyck" had been among those family members named in the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtvschaick.html">will</a> filed by her maiden aunt.			

<p>Her new husband was a fifty-one-year-old Anglican minister's son, landholder, and teacher who, ironically, achieved prominence in the crusade for American liberties culminating in his appointment as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany in 1777. Unfortunately, he became ill and died early in 1779 <a href="../../wills/willjobarclay.html">leaving</a> the widow alone in the Court Street home.</P>

<p>In 1782, now sixty-one-year-old Anna Margarita made out her own <a href="../../wills/willanmgtte.html">will</a>.  Perhaps she also was ill. However, she may have lived for another two decades. She maintained her pew at the Albany <a rehf="drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1790, she had re-located to <a href="../../census1790.html#4836">Watervliet</a> and was living with six other people. Her name was not on the census of 1800. Her will passed probate in December  1802. Childless, she left her substantial estate to neices and nephews.</p>
