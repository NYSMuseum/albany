      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Ten Eyck</b></a> was born in Albany in 
        December 1680. He was the son of Albany <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> 
        <a href="jacote4807.html">Jacob C.</a> and <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">Geertruy 
        Coeymans</a> Ten Eyck. Losing his father before he reached maturity, he 
        grew up in the second ward along with the family of Albany mainstay <a href="../b/jjbleecker2.html">Jan 
        Janse Bleecker</a>. In <a href="../../census1697.html#118">1697</a>, he 
        was sharing a house in Albany with his brother, <a href="barte4811.html">Barent</a>, 
        next to that of his widowed mother.</p>
      <p>In November 1706, he married Bleecker's daughter, <a href="../b/mgtbleecker210.html">Margarita</a>, 
        at the Albany parsonage. By 1725, their eight children had been baptized 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents 
        were members, pewholders, and regular baptism sponsors. Hendrick also 
        served as deacon. </p>

<p>In 1716, he was left a share of his widowed mother's <a href="../../wills/willgeercoey.html">estate</a> and was named co-executor.
		
      <p>These Ten Eycks lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a> where his house first appeared on the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1709tl">assessment 
        roll</a> in 1709. At that time, he was taxed a sum similar to other Albany 
        merchants - although he also was known as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4818">1699</a>, he had signed an 
        oath pledging loyalty to the king of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4818">1720</a>, 
        again in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">1742</a>, and as late 
        as <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4818">1763</a>, his name appeared 
        on a list of qualified voters in the second ward. In <a href="../../census1756.html#85">1756</a>, 
        he was in his late seventies and referred to as "Mr. Tynack" on a census 
        of Albany households. A decade later, his second ward property had one 
        of the highest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a> 
        in the city!</p>
      He also served the community as juror, constable, firemaster, and surveyor. 
      He was a member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian 
      Affairs</a> and among those Albany stalwarts who resigned in October 1746. 
      In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#4818">1715</a>, he served in the 
      Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In 1725, he was the 
      captain of a militia company.
      <p> 
      <p>Hendrick Ten Eyck died in February 1772 in his ninety-second year. His 
        wife may have lived a year longer.</p>
