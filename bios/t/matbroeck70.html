<strong>Maria Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in April 1721. She was a daughter in the large family of Albany leaders <a href="dtbroeck33.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="../c/mgtcuyler591.html">Margarita Cuyler</a> Ten Broeck. She grew up in a merchant's home in Albany's third ward and would <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">inherit</a> a share of the assets from their extensive estate. 


<p>In March, 1739, she was not yet eighteen years old when she married twenty-nine-year-old <a href="../g/gegroesbeck3298.html">Gerardus Groesbeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Four months later, the first of their ten children was christened in Albany where she was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Groesbecks set up their home in the second ward probably in the house Gerardus had inherited from his father, another wealthy merchant and community leader. Businessman Gerardus Groesbeck was able to follow in their footsteps.

<p>Following a marriage that lasted almost fifty years, Gerardus Groesbeck died in September 1788 - leaving Maria in charge of what was a substantial estate. She was identified as the owner of their house in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#70">1788</a>. But thereafter, she probably lived in the homes of <a href="#family">family members</a> as her name no longer was seen in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a>.  

<p>Family-based <a href="../../fhg.html#tbg">resources</a> reveal that Maria Ten Broeck Groesbeck died in December 1805 at "Beaverdam" now Berne. She had lived eighty-four years.</p>
