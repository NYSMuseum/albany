<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Coenradtse</b></a> was born in the Netherlands about 1645. He came to America with his parents Coenradt and Maria Boele Ten Eyck - who settled on Manhattan.</p>

<p>A shoemaker like his father, by the mid-1670s Jacob had relocated to Albany. He married <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">Geertruy Coeymans</a>, the daughter of a prominent landholder. Their offspring established the <a href="teneyck.html">Ten Eyck family</a> in Albany and its hinterland. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and a regular baptism sponsor.<p>

<p>Practicing the shoemaker's trade in Albany, he first leased a house on the hill. By <a href="../../census1679.html#4807">1679</a>, a census of householders included his residence.</p>

<p>During the 1690s, he served as juror and assessor and, for a time, had charge of the church treasury. 



<p>His last child was baptized in August 1695. Jacob C. Ten Eyck was dead by June <a href="../../census1697.html#118">1697</a> when his widow was listed on the census as the head of the household.</p>
