<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Teller</b></a> was born in 1659. He was the youngest child of the marriage of New Netherland pioneers <a href="wmteller.html">Willem</a> and  <a href="../d/mgtdonchesen.html">Margarita Donchesen</a> Teller. His mother died while he was a young boy and his father re-married. By that time, his father had become a patentee of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> - although may not have lived there. Willem Teller did <a href="../../census1679.html#wmteller">retain</a> his Albany properties and was listed as an Albany resident for many years.

<p>In August 1686, Johannes wed Susanna Wendell at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Both marriage partners were identified as living in Albany at that time. However, their first child was not baptized in Albany until February 1691 - a year after the raid on Schenectady in which Johannes <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/schbr1690.html">reportedly</a> was taken prisoner! By 1698, however, three more children had been christened in the Albany church.

<p>During the 1690s, Johannes Teller was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#027">mainstay</a>. He was a constable and high constable in 1694 and '95. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5337">1699</a>, he joined other Albany residents in swearing allegiance to the king of England. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/teller.html">sources</a> imply that he was a resident of Schenectady. At the same time, he was included on Albany survey documents. As late as <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5337">1709</a>, his Albany property in the first ward was valued on city tax rolls.


<p>After 1700, Johannes Teller began receiving land at Schenectady from his father - reportedly to help offset losses sustained in the raid of 1690. Johannes probabaly lived there until May 1725 when he made his will. He died in Schenectady at the end of June.
