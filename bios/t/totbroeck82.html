<strong>Tobias Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in February 1689. He was the <a href="tbvb.html#list">thirteenth</a> and last child born to the marriage of Albany leader <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> and <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">Christina Van Buren</a> Ten Broeck. He grew up in the comfortable <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> home and the east bank farm of one of the most important men in early Albany.

<p>In 1715, he was <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">named</a> to inherit a share of his father's estate and land on the Roeloff Jansen Kill in Livingston Manor where he served as a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia officer</a>.

<p>In October 1714, he was twenty-six when he married Maria Van Stryen (Van Struyven) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. They settled in Claverack but their four children were christened in Albany between 1715 and 1721. 

<p>Tobias Ten Broeck was identified as a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">freeholder</a> of Claverack and a magistrate of the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">county</a> court in 1719. A few years later, he was one of the elders of the <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/livstn/linlithgo_rfmd.htm">new Dutch church</a> located in today's Linlithgo. However, his rise was cut short by an untimely death in January 1724 at the age of thirty-four. He was buried in the family plot. His widow married the church minister a few years later.</p>
