 <P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Ten Eyck, Jr.</b></a> was born in October 
        1744. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="jahte4882.html">Jacob 
        H.</a> and <a href="../w/anwendell2750.html">Anna Wendell</a> Ten Eyck.</p>
		
<p>In May 1767, he married <a href="../d/mgtdouw2157.html">Margarita Douw</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both partners were lifelong members. By 1785, their seven children had been baptized there.</p>

<p>Hendrick Ten Eyck, Jr. came of age after the end of the <a href="../../7yw.html">colonial 
        wars</a> and joined with his neighbors in <a href="../../solconst.html#4875">questioning</a> 
        British policies of the late 1760s. His perspective may have been altered 
        when he received the provincial appointment as <a href="../../sheriffs.html#201">sheriff</a> 
        of Albany County in 1770. At that time, he was an emerging merchant and 
        member of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and other 
        community-based organizations.</p>

<p>Although initially supporting the resistance effort with supplies, he was considered a royal official and remained under <a href="../../friends.html">suspicion</a> throughout the war. In May 1777, he was asked to swear an oath of allegiance to New York State. He refused and was threatened with deportation to the British. He apparently did take the oath and remained in the community. He later received a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.</p>

<p>After the war, he re-established his business and was elected alderman for the second ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1786">1786</a>. While serving on the city council, he was appointed justice of the Albany County Court of Common Pleas in 1789. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4875">1790</a>, his Pearl Street household was attended by three slaves.</p>

<p>In 1792, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjote4890.html">will</a> 
        filed by his uncle. 
      <p>Hendrick Ten Eyck, Jr. died in September 1795 - "a highly respected citizen" 
        and was buried from the Dutch church. Letters of administration were issued 
        on his estate the following March. </p>
