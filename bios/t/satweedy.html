<P><a href="#sources"><b>Sarah Tweedy</b></a> was born in Newport, Rhode Island in April 1739. She was the daughter of John Tweedy.</p>


<p>In September 1757, she married Albany native <a href="../c/phcuyler603.html">Philip Cuyler</a> in Newport after securing a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#nyml">marriage license</a> in New York. The marriage produced a number of children baptized in New York, Newport, and Albany.</p>

<p>After living in Newport and New York, these Cuylers settled in Albany where Philip engaged in family business following the death of his father in 1765. By 1768, Sarah was a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.</p>

<p>Umlike his brother and father, both of whom served as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany, Philip kept a low civic profile. As none of their children survived, the couple were living alone in a second ward house in <a href="../../census1790.html#603">1790</a> and in 1800. After 1802, Philip's name dropped from Albany rolls.</p> 

<p>Family-based resources tell us that  Sarah Tweedy Cuyler died in Newark, New Jersey in 1825 - two months shy of her eighty-sixth birthday.</p>
