<strong>Andries Teller</strong></a> was born in 1642. He was the oldest son of Scottish-born, <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="wmteller.html">Willem</a> and <a href="../d/mgtdonchesen.html">Margarita Donchesen</a> Teller. He grew up in the home of a <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> trader who also was a <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> patentee. 


<p>In June 1671, he married Sophia (Feytie) Van Cortlandt in New York City. The marriage produced several children who were christened in the Dutch churches of New York and in <a href="../../drc.html">Albany</a> where Andries was a member. In <a href="http://users.crocker.com/~jcamp/funeral1.html">1674</a>, he was among those notables invited to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer.

<p>These Tellers settled in Albany where Andries followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. The Albany census of <a href="../../census1679.html#6605">1679</a> accorded his holdings the highest of assessments. 

<p>During the 1670s, he was a merchant and magistrate and was an active trader on the Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market. However, by the late 1690s, he had followed his father downriver to Manhattan.

<p>Andries Teller was living in New York in November 1702 when he filed a <a href="http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Court/NYCWills.1665.html">will</a>. It left his estate to has wife and then to his children. He died some time thereafter.</p>
