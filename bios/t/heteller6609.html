<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Helena Teller</strong></a> is said to have been born in September 1645. She was the eldest daughter of New Netherland pioneers <a href="wmteller.html">Willem</a> and <a href="../d/mgtdonchesen.html">Margaret Donchesen</a> Teller. Helena grew up in the large family of a broadly based entrepreneur but had lost her mother by April 1664 when her father re-married.

<p>In August 1664, she married emerging trader and tradesman <a href="../b/cobogardus6362.html">Cornelis Bogardus</a> at the Dutch church in New Amsterdam. Their <a href="../b/cobogardus6363.html">son</a> was born in 1664.

<p>In September 1666, her father was suing her late husband in New York. At that time, Helena was identified as the "widow of Cornelis Bogardus."

<p>Perhaps she married Albany resident <a href="../vb/jhvbael.html">Jan Hendrickse Van 
Bael</a> in 1668. That marriage may have produced children before his death in 1682. In September 1683, Helena is <a href="http://www.njgsbc.org/files/familyfiles/p551.htm#i17752">said</a> to have married <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Rombouts">one</a> Francis Rombouts of New York City. The well-known Rombouts died in 1691.

<p>We are told that Helena Teller Bogardus Rombouts was dead by March 1707.

<p>This compilation (and nerviously <a href="../../res/guess.html">spec</a>ulative) sketch mostly represents conventional <a href="../../res/ts.html">wisdoms</a> regarding the life of a one-time Albany resident. With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on her life, we move on for <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">now</a>.</p>
