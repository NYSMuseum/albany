          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Elsie Ten Broeck</B></A> was born in Albany 
            about 1665. She was the first daughter and second of thirteen children 
            born to city father <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>             native <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">Christina Van Buren</a> Ten 
            Broeck.</P>

          <P>Elsie grew up in Albany learning how to raise a large family and to accept 
            the additional responsibilities that came with wealth and privilege. 
            In November 1684, she married upwardly mobile merchant <a href="../c/jocuyler546.html">Johannes 
            Cuyler</a>. They set up their household in the Cuyler house on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
            Street</a> just up the hill from her parents' landmark State Street 
            home.</P>

<p>These Cuylers were outstanding early Albany people. Johannes was a prominent merchant, landholder, and public official. Between 1685 and 1709, Elsie gave birth to twelve children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were prominent members. Between 1688 and 1735, Elsie Cuyler witnessed more than three dozen baptisms.</p>

<p>Johannes Cuyler died in 1740 but not before naming his wife of fifty-four years as his heir for her lifetime. She already had inherited property from her father's substantial estate.</p>

<p></p>Elsie died on June 28, 1752 and was buried under the church. Seven of <a href="#children">her children married</a> members of the most successful early Albany families. Daughter, wife, mother, and grandmother of four <a href="../../mayors.html">Albany mayors</a>, Elsie Ten Broeck Cuyler was an early Albany matriarch!<p></p>
