<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Teller</b></a> was the daughter of New Netherland pioneers <a href="wmteller.html">Willem</a> and <a href="../d/mgtdonchesen.html">Margaret Donchasen</a> Teller. She probably was born during the 1640s.</p>


<p>Her first husband was Beverwyck and Albany trader <a href="../va/pivallen5629.html">Pieter Van Allen</a>. The marriage produced several children before his death in 1674. In 1676, she was a widow and was called "Maria <a href="#look">Lookermans</a>." At that time, she was petitioning the Albany court to prosecute her late husband's debtors on her behalf.</ap>

<p>In February 1677, she married (maybe for the third time) <a href="../vn/gevness899.html">Gerrit Van Ness</a> after signing a pre-nuptual agreement protecting her widow's holdings. Over the next decade, she appears to have given birth to a number of Van Ness children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member. These Van Nesses were Albany residents.</p>

<p>Maria Teller Van Allen Loockermans Van Ness was dead by March 1715 when Gerrit Van Ness filed his <a href="../../wills/willgevness899.html">will</a>. That instrument superceded a joint will probabaly filed after 1708 - when she still would have been alive. Her son, <a href="../va/wivallen5687.html">Willem Van Allen</a>, was a prominent Albany resident.  </p>
