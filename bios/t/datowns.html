<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>David Townsend</strong></a> was a physician whose duties brought him to Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that he was born in Boston in 1753, and was the son of Shippie and Ann Balch Townsend. The first Townsend is said to have emigrated to Massachusetts in 1637.

<p>A number of same-named contemporaries are at-risk. This sketch strives to focus on Townsend in his Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>. This individual does not appear to be related to the Oyster Bay-based family of future Albany physician Dr. <a href="chdtownsend.html">Charles D. Townsend</a>.

<p>He is said to have graduated from Harvard in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uSwoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22david+townsend%22+joseph+warren&source=bl&ots=LXAMebMLcb&sig=SgCUQf5un8Ae1yg-HutLSIN5KWA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim35uyqqXNAhXHWD4KHTEuBiAQ6AEIUTAJ#v=onepage&q=%22david%20townsend%20&f=false">1770</a> and to have <a href="http://www.drjosephwarren.com/2012/11/methinks-it-would-lead-a-flinty-soul-to-pity-us/">studied medicine</a> with Dr. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Warren">Joseph Warren</a>. Townsend is said to have <a href="http://boston1775.blogspot.com/search/label/Dr.%20David%20Townsend">served</a> with Warren (who was killed) at Bunker Hill. He then was commissioned a <a href="http://www.gilderlehrman.org/collections/f1072026-f98c-4d46-bce3-351701433111">surgeon</a> in the "Sixth Regiment of Foot" early in 1776 and then named "Senior Surgeon to the General Hospital, Northern Department" in March 1777. He is said to have spent the winter with Washington at Valley Forge and may have come to Albany from there. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek to document</a> his activities in Albany more fully.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October 1779</a>, the holdings of "Dr. Townsend" were valued on the Albany assessment roll.

<p>In October 1780, he engaged in a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hTxIAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA308&lpg=PA308&dq=%22dr+David+Townsend%22+albany&source=bl&ots=WD9Abt_Bsv&sig=xHXKLtqGzve8QnFbKkHsi5EydLg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjriayw6M_NAhWly4MKHQZiDvgQ6AEIIzAD#v=onepage&q=%22dr%20David%20Townsend%22%20albany&f=false">correspondence</a> with a colleague where he wrote from Albany regarding regional military matters of note. The subsequent printing of that exchange editorialized that "The very high character of Dr. Townsend, lends great weight and authority to the letter." 

<p>In July 1781, Townsend was <a href="http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/rev/MedMen/MedMenCh13.html">stationed</a> at the <a href="../../loc/hospital.html">Albany Hospital</a>.

<p>With the end of the war, Townsend returned to Boston and entered private practice. He served on a number of professional Boards and as a public health <a href="http://www.donaldheald.com/pages/books/26722/david-townsend/principles-and-observations-applied-to-the-manufacture-and-inspection-of-pot-and-pearl-ashes">official</a>. After his time in Albany, he appears to have authored a number of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MngIAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=%22david+townsend%22+joseph+warren&source=bl&ots=slHRluKT13&sig=IxmtKzrdXMWhMWA0uQTpS5Bg2sM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWlKHIraXNAhWIeSYKHfczCZY4ChDoAQgoMAQ#v=onepage&q=%22david%20townsend%22%20joseph%20warren&f=false">works</a> on medical and other subjects. 

<p>In May 1785, he married one Elizabeth Davis. Perhaps she was his second wife. The union produced at least seven children included a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GPssAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1157&lpg=PA1157&dq=%22solomon+townsend%22+surgeon&source=bl&ots=4w4uTddgdk&sig=crkENNj6xsD2WMbvYYYEBGkR-0s&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjp1LzgjqXNAhUDET4KHb91BvYQ6AEILzAD#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20townsend%22%20surgeon&f=false">noted</a> Massachusetts surgeon. He <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FM8UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA2618&lpg=PA2618&dq=%22david+townsend%22+joseph+warren&source=bl&ots=P0Tnbo6dMO&sig=52nk4kKNldk5HDKMVOBAxRc5OYs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWlKHIraXNAhWIeSYKHfczCZY4ChDoAQguMAY#v=onepage&q=%22david%20townsend%22%20joseph%20warren&f=false">may have married</a> one Elizabeth Bayley in Boston in 1777. He is said to have been an ardent Universalist and a follower of <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Mas</a>onry. He appears to have signed in at the Union Lodge in <a href="http://www.omdhs.syracusemasons.com/sites/default/files/history/Craft%20Masonry%20in%20Albany%20County.pdf">1777</a>.  




<p>Dr. David Townsend died in Boston in April 1829.</p>
