<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Ezekiel Tiffany</strong></a> appears to have been born between 1756 and 1774 (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0-dEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA32&lpg=PA32&dq=ezekiel+tiffany%22&source=bl&ots=3HjCUTm0EQ&sig=kJYoT62-TTjXBrwJIGz7zvs3blI&hl=en&ei=g-_bTOasOIOClAed-83fCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=ezekiel%20tiffany%22&f=false">perhaps</a> in March 1763). He appears to be the son of Ezekiel of Massachusetts. However, his first name was common within his family thus giving us <a href="../qqqq.html">pause</a> in the assignment of qualitative information.
		
      <p>Perhaps he was the Ezekiel Tiffany who was accorded a lot in the initial 
        partition of property in Cabot, Vermont in November 1786. 
		
      <p>A few years later, a man named Ezekiel Tiffany was living in Albany. 
        His wife was named Margaret (perhaps she was the daughter of his neighbor, 
        <a href="../n/chnewman.html">Charles Newman</a>) - a women of a similar 
        age. Their child was christened in the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> 
        church in May 1789. 
		
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#ezt">1788</a>, 
        his name and property were listed on the first ward assesssment roll next 
        to the house of Charles Newman. In <a href="../../census1790.html#ezt">1790</a> 
        and in <a href="../../census1800.html#ezt">1800</a>, his household was 
        configured on the census of the first ward and charted the growth of his 
        young family. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his 
        holdings were accorded a modest assessment. 
      <p>In 1798, he was included on an Albany jury pool and characterized as 
        a "gentleman." Perhaps later Albany resident <a href="wmtiffany.html">William 
        Tiffany</a> was his son. 
      <p>Ezekiel Tiffany died after 1800. Perhaps he was the "Ezra Tiffany" for 
        whose <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a> letters of 
        administration were issued in March 1803. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1815</a>, 
        his widow, Margaret, was identified as the head of a household at 107 
        Fox Street.</p>
