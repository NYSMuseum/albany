<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Isaac I. Truax</strong></a> was born in May 1759. He was the son of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents Isaac and Susanna Roseboom Truax. He was known as Isaac I. Truax and may have served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for Albany's third ward in 1774 and 1779. 
 
<p> In March 1788, he married Albany native <a href="../b/jableecker198.html">Jannetje Bleecker</a>. By 1798, five children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and pewholder.

<p>This Truax family settled in Albany and were <a href="../../census1790.html#1959">mainline</a> city residents throughout their marriage. He was a merchant who conducted business from his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1959">home</a> on the west side of <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">Market Street</a>. He also owned additional lots deep in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#1959">1800</a>, his household included seven members of his family and one slave. Isaac freed her, a twenty-seven-year-old mulatto named Diana, in 1810. In that year, his household included two free people of color - mirroring what had become a <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#1810">widespread practice</a> during the last days of slavery in Albany.  

<p>Isaac I. Truax lost his wife in March of 1811. He lived only a year longer and died at the age of fifty-three in October 1812. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in November.

Truax is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1959.

We are cautious in assigning information about the several Isaac Truaxes living in the Albany area. Although we believe he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1959">land bounty right</a> in association with the first regiment of the militia, we seek information on his activities during the <a href="../../or/or.html">war years</a>!</font>
