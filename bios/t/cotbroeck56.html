<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in 1727 and christened in Albany on May 22. He was the son of <a href="jotbroeck52.html">Johannes Ten Broeck</a> and his second wife <a href="../vr/cavr5063.html">Catharina Van Rensselaer</a> Ten Broeck. A middle child in a very large <a href="#fam">family</a>, this Cornelis grew up in the first ward home of a prominent businessman and civic leader. As a number of same-named contemporaries are at-risk including a quite <a href="cotbroeck31.html">prominent</a> and contemporary Albany city resident, we are cautious in the assignment of qualitative information to his life. This subject is more closely identified with <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Claverack</a>.

<p>Family-based <a href="tbroeck.html#sources">resources</a> tell us that he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Maria <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Le4pAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA524&lpg=PA524&dq=bodyn+family&source=bl&ots=P_fu2Zry6K&sig=bc1DY9hxneOOZ9_Tk_eQ2jrwHJs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi437aym_rVAhWP14MKHVfwAJEQ6AEIUzAO#v=onepage&q=bodyn%20family&f=false">Bodyn</a> of New Jersey. Perhaps, he met the bride as a result of his parents' frequent stays in New Brunswick. Maria appears to have been the daughter of a <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> family. The marriage is said to have produced six children (1755-65) who were christened in New Jersey and then in Claverack.

<p>In 1766, the property of Cornelis was valued modestly on the Claverack assessment roll. In February 1767, the property of the widow of Corn Jno. Ten Broeck was noted in the same location.

<p>The <i>Ten Broeck Genealogy</i> tells us that the couple resided in the Claverack - Kinderhook area but that Cornelis died during the "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&q=1766+land+riots&oq=1766+land+riots&gs_l=psy-ab.3...3011.6682.0.6970.15.12.0.0.0.0.262.1171.1j3j3.7.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..8.5.944...0j38j0i22i30k1j33i160k1j33i21k1.0LsS5RD3T3c">land riots</a>" on June 26, 1766. Cornelis "Jno." Ten Broeck would have not yet reached his fortieth birthday.</p>
