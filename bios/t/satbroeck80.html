<strong>Sara Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in May 1725. She was the daughter of Albany leaders 
<a href="dtbroeck33.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="../c/mgtcuyler591.html">Margarita Cuyler</a> Ten Broeck. She grew up in a prominent merchant's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1748, she was <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">named</a> to inherit a share of her father's substantial estate. 


<p>In May 1746, Sara was about twenty-one when she married thirty-six-year-old <a href="johte4890.html">Johannes H. Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1758, four children had been christened in Albany where Sara was a member and pewholder for many years. However, her family remained small as all of her children died young.

<p>Without children, Sara <a href="../../census1790.html#4890">lived</a> with her husband in their <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home attended by a number of servants.


<p>Sara lost her husband in 1794. In 1792, she had been <a href="../../wills/willjote4890.html">named</a> co-executor of John's estate along with her brother <a href="abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a>. Perhaps she moved in with the Ten Broecks as Sara was not counted among the heads of household living in Albany in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>. Sara Ten Broeck Ten Eyck died in February 1801 at the age of seventy six. Her will passed probate in April 1802. It freed her slave "Jan."</p>
