<strong>Geertie Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in January 1736. She was the daughter of Jacob and Alida Visscher Ten Eyck.

<p>In July 1769, she married a slightly younger <a href="../p/jopruyn3558.html">John F. Pruyn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps because she was a thirty-two-year-old spinster at the time of her marriage the marriage appears to have been childless. However, she was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor at the church.

<p>Pruyn was a businessman who established a home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. The couple <a href="../../census1790.html#3558">lived there</a> served by a number of slaves in a marriage that lasted almost forty years.  


<p>Geertie Ten Eyck Pruyn died in May 1807 and was buried in the church plot. Her husband died in 1815. She had lived seventy years.</p>
