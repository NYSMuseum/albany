<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Lyntie Ten Eyck</strong></a> (called "Lyntie" in extant <a href="../../res/sp.html">records</a>) was born in March 1770. She was the daughter of <a href="heteyck4875.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../d/mgtdouw2157.html">Margarita Douw</a> Ten Eyck. A daughter of the last colonial sheriff, she grew up in a comfortable Pearl Street <a href="../../census1790.html#4875">home</a> surrounded by numerous kin. 

<p>At the end of March 1794, Lyntie married Albany native <a href="../d/sydouw2226.html">Sybrant Douw</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she had been a pewholder since at least 1790. Two children were christened there in 1794 and 1798.

<p>This Douw family also made its home on Pearl Street where in 1800 eight family members were served by five slaves. Sybrant Douw was a budding tavern owner and businessman who career was cut short when he died in March 1809 at the age of forty-two.

<p>Perhaps she was the "<a href="#wid">Widow</a> Catherine Douw" who was first <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22douw+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22douw%20widow%22&f=false">listed</a> in the city directory at 12 Orange Street in 1813.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GeZKAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA3-PA7&lpg=RA3-PA7&dq=%22lyntie+douw%22&source=bl&ots=l0beYjpiP_&sig=tlx0QXZ8-l6TeFYC4gNjdL6aBac&hl=en&ei=RYvbTsbVN4j40gG01aTIDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22lyntie%20douw%22&f=false">1832</a>, along with two brothers, she was identified as a stockholder in the "Madison County Bank."
