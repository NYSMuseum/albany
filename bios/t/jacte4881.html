          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Jacob C. Ten Eyck</B></A> was born in April 1705. He 
            was the first of the ten children born to Albany silversmith <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt Ten Eyck</a> and his wife, <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje Van Schaick</a> Ten Eyck. </P>

<p><a href="#bowl"><img src="../../images/jacteyckbowl.jpg" align=left width=150 height=101 border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="silver bowl made by Jacob C. Ten Eyck"></a> At age fifteen, he was sent to New York and apprenticed with Charles Le Roux - a notable silversmith and engraver. Perhaps he remained in New York beyond the apprenticeship - practicing his craft and beginning to work with gold.</p>

          <P>By 1736, he had returned to Albany where he married Albany native <a href="../c/cacuyler371.html">Catharina 
            Cuyler</a>. A decade older than most early Albany grooms, his family 
            was comparatively small with only four children baptized between 1741 
            and 1749 in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both 
            parents were members.</P>


<p>These Ten Eycks set up their home in the second ward where Jacob gained immediate acceptance. After serving as constable and firemaster, Jacob won election to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> first as an assistant in 1734. In 1741, he was elected alderman for the first ward and held that position for a number of years. In 1747, he was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County. Then, he was named <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany in 1748. He served for two years. Following his term at city hall, he again was elected alderman in 1750 for the second ward and served through 1762.</p>

<p>He relocated back to the first ward to a house on lower <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. By that time, he was one of the wealthiest Albany businessmen with property assessments regularly near the top of the community's householders. He owned a number of <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#217">lots</a> within the city as well.</p>

<p>In April 1788, his signature was at the top of a <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#4881">list</a> of Albany antifederalists standing up in opposition to ratification of the Federal Constitution. Although well into his eighties, the home of Jacob C. Ten Eyck, where he <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4881">lived</a> with his wife and three servants, was an Albany landmark as late as <a href="../../census1790.html#4881">1790</a>.</p>

<p>Jacob C. Ten Eyck died on September 9, 1793. He had lived past his eighty-eighth birthday.</p>
