      <P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Ralph Thompson</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">some</a>times 
        Thomson) was an Albany resident during the last quarter of the eighteenth 
        century. Subsequent information <a href="../../census1800.html#rath">tells</a> 
        us that he was born between 1756 and 1774. We seek information on his 
        <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 
      <p>His wife was <a href="anthomp.html">Ann</a>. In July 1789, their son (Archibald) was <a href="http://bettyfink1.com/aluth005.htm">ch</a>ristened at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. In October 1790, another son, John, was baptized at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#rath">1788</a>, his house and property were valued on the city assessment roll at the end of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#rath">1790</a>, the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> household of Ralph Thompson included four members. A decade later, the <a href="../../census1800.html#rath">census</a> showed three young boys, a young girl, and a man and slightly younger woman at the same location. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the first ward assessment valued his house, lot, and property modestly and noted that <a href="../q/abq1969.html">Abraham Quackenbush</a> was living there as well.

      <p>After that, his name has not <a href="../qqqq.html">yet</a> been encountered 
        in our sweep of available community-based resources.
      <p>He does not seem to have been accounted for in the first city directory published in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22thompson%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=thompson&f=false">1813</a>.


<p>In 1816, the widow Ann Thompson was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 75 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. 

<p>We <a href="../../res/guess.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Ralph Thompson. Also <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzling</a> is the seeming absence of expected qualitative information (economic and governmental) in the community-based record. At this point, we step back and move on.</p>
