<strong>Catharina Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in January 1717. She was the daughter of <a href="jotbroeck52.html">Johannes Ten Broeck</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vr/cavr5063.html">Catharina Van Rensselaer</a> Ten Broeck. She grew up in a large family in her father's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home.

<p>In July 1738, she married widower <a href="../h/ryhansen4960.html">Ryckert Hansen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1754, the marriage had produced ten children who were christened at the Albany church where she was a member and pewholder.

<P>This Hansen family lived in the third ward where Ryckert's fortunes continued to decline down to his death during the mid-1760s. With meager resources, Catharina was left to raise her children by calling on family connections. 

<p>In 1770, she was given a share of the cross river <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> in conjunction with former officer <a href="../l/thlottridge414.html">Thomas Lottridge</a>. Aided by her son, <a href="../h/dihansen4970.html">Dirck</a>, she held that license until her death during the 1780s.</p>
