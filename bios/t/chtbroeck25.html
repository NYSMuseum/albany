<P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/chtblivingston.jpg" align=left width=150 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Christina Ten Broeck in 1721" border=1></a><A href="#biography"><B>Christina Ten Broeck</B></A> was born on December 30, 1718. She was the third of the twelve children of Albany civic leader Dirck Ten Broeck and his wife Margarita Cuyler. She grew up in Albany with her sisters and brother in a comfortable home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>.</p>

          <P>At age twenty-one, Christina married <a href="../l/phlivingston.html">Philip 
            Livingston, Jr.</a> at the Albany Dutch church in 1740. These Livingstons 
            established their residence in New York City. But the first of her 
            nine children was baptized at the Albany Dutch church in 1741. They 
            also had a country house and farm on Brooklyn Heights.</P>

<p>Philip Livingston became a successful merchant, provincial official, and a leader of the crusade for American liberties. As a member of the Continental Congress, Livingston and his family lived for a time in Philadelphia. Following the British occupation in 1776, his property in New York was seized and the family was sent upriver for safety. But soon, Philip Livingston became seriously ill. He saw his family for the last time in the spring of 1778. Then he returned to Congress in York, Pennsylvania where he died in June. By that time, sixty-year-old Christina had come home to Albany.</p>

          <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/chtbroeckold.jpg" align= right width=150 h space=4 vspace=4 alt="1771"></a>Despite 
            the years and distance, Christina's Albany roots always remained strong. 
            She was the daughter (and heir) of a prominent Albany family and the 
            older sister of General <a href="abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a>. 
            In 1764, her daughter married the Van Rensselaer patroon - making 
            her a frequent guest at the Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">manor 
            house</a>. A substantial inheritance from her husband, father, and 
            brother included income acreage and houses in Albany.</p> 

<p>A doting grandmother, she spent her remaining years living with her daughters - both of whom had married Dutch Reformed ministers. Settled in Albany, she made her will in in 1800. Eighty-two-year-old Christina Ten Broeck Livingston died on June 29, 1801 and was buried in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> cemetery.</p>
