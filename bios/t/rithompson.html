<P>On April 1, 1806, <a href="#sources"><b>Richard Thompson</b></a> married Jane Johnson, a colored woman, at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Subsequent research has revealed that he was a "free person of color" - a mainline member of the early nineteenth century <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro-Albanian</a> community.</p>


<p><a href="#home"><img src="../../images/jpg/bldg/thompsonhse.jpg" align=right width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=2 alt="House and sign of R. Thompson - grocer"></a> In 1814-16, city directories listed him as a housholder living at 22 <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a>. After that, he was identified as a shoemaker living at 75 North Pearl Street. Although not consistently, his name printed in italics <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">identified</a> him as a "free person of color!" The marriage may have produced children!</p>

<p>In 1830, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household was configured on the Albany census. That is the last reference so far encountered! Perhaps abolitionist Gerrit Smith <a href="http://libwww.syr.edu/digital/collections/g/GerritSmith/437.htm">wrote to him</a> and other Albany activists in March 1846. Or, perhaps his son, Richard Thompson, was buried in the African Methodist Episcopal plot in April 1848!</p>
