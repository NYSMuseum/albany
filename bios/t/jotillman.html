      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Tillman, Sr.</strong></a> was born 
        in Germany in 1725. He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have 
        come to America in the ship <i>Forest</i>. He was <a href="../../nat.html">nat</a>uralized 
        in Pennsylvania in 1752. He also was known as "John Christopher Tillman." 

<p>He probably married Margaret Hertz before they sailed for America. They 
        had a number of children - some of whom were born in Europe. They were 
        <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutherans</a> which may explain why their 
        baptisms were not recorded in the other Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
        Their daughter, Elizabeth, was christened in the Albany Lutheran church 
        in 1761. They were First Lutheran pewholders in the 1780s and 90s. 
<p>In 1757, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. Ten years later, he was a private in a Rensselaerswyck militia 
        company. However, in April 1761, he <a href="../../sources.html#sh">joined</a> 
        the New York provincial militia. At that time, he stated that he was thirty-five-years-old, 
        was born in Germany, was a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cordwainer</a>, 
        was five feet, eight-and-a-half inches tall, had a dark face, black hair, 
        and brown eyes. 

<p>In 1766, his name appeared on the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> roll. In that year, he was one of those who petitioned for land on the         <a href="../../loc/wout.html">Woutenbergh</a> on which to build a German Lutheran Church.
 
<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he served the American cause as a militia officer (ensign and lieutenant), quartermaster, and adjutant. He represented Rensselaerswyck on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> of Correspondence.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jt">1779</a> "Major" John Tillman's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> lot was valued on the city assessment roll.
 
<p>In 1779 and on several occasions afterwards, he was <a href="../../cddc.html">id</a>entified as an innkeeper when he posted bail on behalf of a number of newcomers. Also in 1779, he was <a href="../../sources.html#cp">id</a>entified as a lifelong cordwainer and was the subject of a <a href="../../doc/pettillman1779.html">petition</a> signed by more than a sixty Albany-area Patriots who asked <a href="../../sources.html#cp">Governor Clinton</a> to reinstate him as "Deputy Commissary of Hides for the Northern  Department." 

      <p>During the 1780s and 90s, he was involved in a number of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        estate</a> transactions in the areas around Albany. During the 1770s, 
        the Tillmans purchased lots across the Hudson in the area that would become 
        <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jt">1790</a>, his Watervliet household 
        included two men and two females. He was the head of one of four Tillman-named 
        households listed in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> 
        - a fringe area along the <a href="../../loc/northend.html#road">river 
        road</a> that was becoming populated with newcomers and immigrants - namely 
        John Tillman and his kin. 
      <p>Living into his late sixties, John Tillman died in July 1792. His will 
        passed probate in August. </p>
