<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Barent H. Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in September 1722. He was a younger son in the large family of Albany mainstays <a href="hete4818.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/mgtbleecker210.html">Margarita Bleecker</a> Ten Eyck. 


<p> He married brewer's daughter <a href="../r/helryckman1973.html">Helena Ryckman</a> in April 1745. The marriage may have produced only two children who were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and pewholder. 

<p>He was a <a href="../../census1756.html#61">merchant</a> and the partner of his father-in-law,  <a href="../r/toryckman1994.html">Tobias Ryckman</a>. Their families lived together in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. By 1779, Tobias Ryckman was dead and Barent was identified as the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">owner</a> of substantial Southside property that included the residences of a number of <a href="../../wills/willtoryckman.html">family members</a>. By <a href="../../census1790.html#4845">1790</a>, however, Barent and Lena Ten Eyck had relocated to a comfortable house in the third ward. He <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#barte">owned</a> a brew house in the first ward and additional acreage in the third ward on the north side of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. 

<p>For a half century, Barent H. Ten Eyck was an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4845">mainstay</a> and a family leader. He was a prominent <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4845">merchant</a>, member of the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> (assistant alderman and then elected alderman for the first ward in 1761), <a href="../../solconst.html#4845">active</a> in the <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4845">opposition</a> to British restrictions, and a contractor of the city. 

<p>Barent H. Ten Eyck died in 1792. His will passed probate on September 29.
