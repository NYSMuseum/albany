<strong>Augustinus Turck</strong></a> was born in July 1700. He was the youngest son of <a href="jaturck5323.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="../vb/cavbt5403.html">Catharina Van Benthuysen</a> Turck. He grew up a member of a large family in what started out as the second ward home of a <a href="../../census1697.html#139">pr</a>ominent businessman and city official.

<p>However, his mother died in 1705 and his father re-married. Jacobus Turck already had moved the family to his second wife's hometown of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> by the time he died in 1711 - thus leaving young Augustinus to an uncertain adolescence.   

<p>In April 1722, the Albany native married Anna <a href="../k/ketel.html">K</a>ettlehuyn at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage does not seem to have produced children. Although his father remained active in Albany church ceremonies, this son witnessed only one baptism during the 1720s.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1723">1723</a>, he was named city marshall and appears to have held that post for a number of years. He was compensated by the Albany government for his services. In November 1726, city records noted that he was practicing <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>. 

<p>In 1727, his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zQIKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA378&lpg=PA378&dq=%22augustinus+turk%22&source=bl&ots=fDi0KItHj4&sig=sfES_tg041ZoBvL4FcSJRt_AD_A&hl=en&ei=7nHbSZilIKbmlQfz8KWHCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9">account</a> for two pounds three shillings for use of his canoe from <a href="../../na/oswego.html">O</a>swego to New York was among a long list of those approved for payment in the <a href="../../sources.html#clny">colonial laws</a> of the province.

<p>Augustinus Turck has not been encountered further in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based</a> resources thus far considered. However, he may have witnessed a baptism in Rhinebeck with his wife, Anna, in <a href="http://newenglandancestors.com/database_search/beekman.asp?file=research%5Cdatabase%5Cbeekman%5Ccontent%5CVol.03_126.html">1751</a>. Additional notations under the name "Augustinus Turck" from the general time period suggest a life in the region south of Albany.</p>
