<P>The <a href="#sources"><b>Ten Broeck</b></a> family of early Albany and colonial New York is descended from Wessel Wesselse who came to New Netherland during the 1630s. His son, <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a>, became one of the <a href="../../cityfathers.html">fathers</a> of the city of Albany. His <a href="tbvb.html">many offspring</a> established the Ten Broeck name in Albany and beyond.</p>


<p>By <a href="../../census1697.html#063">1697</a>, trader-turned-businessman <a href="wtbroeck83.html">Wessel Ten Broeck</a> had joined his father on the city census.</p>

<p>In 1720, three Ten Broeck men were <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">Albany freeholders</a>. By that time, the family had established itself east of the Hudson on country estates anchored by Dirck Wesselse's estate on the Roelof Jansen Kil.</p>

<p>Wessel's son, <a href="dtbroeck33.html">Dirck Ten Broeck</a>, was appointed mayor of Albany in 1746. He died in 1751. But his <a href="../c/mgtcuyler591.html">widow</a> and three other Ten Broeck households were enumerated on the <a href="../../census1756.html">city census</a> of 1756. </p>

<p> Dirck and Margarita's son, General <a href="abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a>, businessman, field officer in the Revolutionary army, and the was third member of the family to serve as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany. He was the most widely known family member. He was one of three Ten Broecks who owned homes in the third ward in <a href="../../census1790.html#third">1790</a>. The former administrator of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, he built Ten Broeck mansion - the historic house headquarters of the 
<a href="http://www.timesunion.com/communities/tenbroeck/">Albany County Historical Association</a>.</p>

<p>His only son, <a href="ditbroeck37.html">Dirck</a>, served as speaker of the New York State Assembly in 1798. 

<p>In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1815</a>, only two Ten Broeck households remained in the city.</p>

<p>After Ten Broeck Mansion and the "Ten Broeck Triangle" neighborhood of <a href="../../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor Hill</a>, the family is recalled today in the names of numerous public buildings in Albany and beyond.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> Information on this important early Albany family is derived chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Manuscript resources are extensive if widely scattered. <a href="../../fhg.html#tbg">Emma Ten Broeck Runk's</a> comprehensive, century-old narrative genealogy stands out among the family resources. It has been duplicated <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89066363458;view=1up;seq=1">online</a>. Although somewhat derivative of the above, substantial family information is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~markfreeman/tenbroeck.html">available online</a>. The most recent Internet-based <a href="http://collectornuts.com/tenbroeck.pdf">initiative</a> by Mary Lou Cook bears watching.
