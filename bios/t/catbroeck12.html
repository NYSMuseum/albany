<strong>Catharina Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born about 1666. She was an older daughter in the <a href="tbvb.html">large family</a> of <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> and <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">Christina Van Buren</a> Ten Broeck. She grew up in a wealthy and prominent businessman's homes in Albany and in the surrounding countryside.

<p>In October 1688, she married Barbadian-born Johannes Legget then of New York. Their union was recorded in the annals of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced children who do not appear to have been christened at the Albany church where Catharina was a member.

<p>These Leggets lived in New York and on Ten Broeck land in eastern Albany County. 

<p> In 1715, she was named in her father's <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">will</a> and left a share of his substantial estate. By the time the will was probated in 1718, she was called a widow.


<p>Catharina Ten Broeck Legget died in October 1725 at the age of fifty-nine.</p>
