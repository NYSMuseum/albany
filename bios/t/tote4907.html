<P>Southern Albany County notable <a href="#sources"> <strong>Tobias Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in May 1723. He was the son of <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt</a> and <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje Van Schaick</a> Ten Eyck. He was a younger son in the large family of an Albany silversmith and businessman. This subject, Tobias <a href="cote4812.html">C</a>. Ten Eyck, has been confused with his older and more visible cousin <a href="tote4830.html">Tobias H. Ten Eyck</a> (the son of Hendrick who married the daughter of <a href="../d/jodp.html">Johannes De Peyster</a>).

<p>During the 1740s, he was among those who provided lumber, supplies, and munitions to Albany's fort and fortifications. During that time, his <a href="jacte4881.html">older brother</a> was sheriff then mayor of Albany.

<p>In 1755, he supported the New York <a href="../../7yw.html">war effort</a> by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Dd4TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA684&lpg=PA684&dq=%22tobyas+c+ten+eyk%22&source=bl&ots=_3zTu4xGiL&sig=Kt1Kqj3dHMDZQMN4xDnG1sody6w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MTMzUpuxD9LH4APmpICQCQ&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22tobyas%20c%20ten%20eyk%22&f=false">carrying</a> ordnance, guns, carriages, and stores from New York to Albany on his <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sloop</a>. At that time, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Dd4TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA680&lpg=PA680&dq=%22christina%22&source=web&ots=_2vLAZrLgM&sig=tHspJOtOr1EHK8b63zc44UEMQ08&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#v=onepage&q=christina&f=false">identified</a> as the master of the Hudson River sloop <i>Christina</i> which he owned with his brother <a href="antte4842.html">Anthony</a>. 

<p>Beginning in 1756, his name appeared on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> documents filed by members of his large family. In November, he was identified as the son of Coenradt in the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtvschaick.html">will</a> filed by his maiden aunt. As late as October 1782, he was <a href="../../wills/willanmgtte.html">named</a> co-executor of the estate of his <a href="anmgte4836.html">sister</a> and one-time Coeymans neighbor. At that time four brothers were still living.

<p>In February 1756, this Tobias married a somewhat younger <a href="../vb/juvburen.html">Judith Van Buren</a> of Schodack at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1772, the marriage had produced at least six children who were christened in Albany and elsewhere in Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Co</a>unty. In 1754, he was a pew holder in the gallery at the Albany church.

<p>These Ten Eycks raised their family on a farmstead on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West Manor</a> where his main property was valued substantially. In <a href="../../im/im1767.html#135">1767</a>, his farm (near the southern border of he West manor) was located on a map of Rensselaerswyck. In June 1788, he participated in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">partitioning</a> of the <a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans Patent</a> (obtaining 2,500 acres). Later in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=%22tobias+ten+eyck%22+john+glen&source=bl&ots=jw8Q-zn2iV&sig=AMBT1skS2RsGc3CEs6PnYkqgfx4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BUNAUvuJJO_F4AOlsoDQBA&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22tobias%20ten%20eyck%22%20john%20glen&f=false">1766</a>, he was among those who <a href="../../res/realestate.html">leased</a> a lot where the <a href="../../map/map1765.html">barracks</a> formerly stood. 

<p>His Coeymans/Selkirk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobias_Ten_Eyck_House_and_Cemeteries">home</a> (said to have been built about 1760) and associated <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/w/a/l/Ronald-A-Waldron/PHOTO/0009photo.html">buildings</a>  have been the subject of some scholarship.  At this <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">point</a>, however, we cannot pursue that part of his story. 

<p>During the 1760s, he was identified as an enlisted man in a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In his early fifties at the outbreak of hostilities, we expect to find some record of his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime activities</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#4907">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> and was served by ten slaves.

<p>Albany native and Rensselaerswyck then Coeymans resident resident Tobias Ten Eyck died in November 1791. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">pro</a>bate in Albany County in March 1792. His widow survived until 1823.</p>
