<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Charles De Kay Townsend</strong></a> was born in 1778 at Goshen, in Orange County. He was the son of Absalom and Helena De Kay Townsend who fled Oyster Bay, Long Island with the British occupation of lower New York. He does not appear to have been closely related to <a href="datowns.html">Dr. David Townsend</a>, a Yankee surgeon at the Albany hospital during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>.

<p>Arriving in Albany by 1798, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">identified</a> on community-based surveys as a "Merchant."

<p>After arriving in Albany, he entered the field of medical practice. In 1802, he is said to have attended "Medical Lectures" at Columbia College. Perhaps, beginning in 1803, he was trained by Albany physicians Drs. <a href="../m/wilman.html">Mancius</a> and <a href="../w/hunwood.html">Woodruff</a> - pillars of the postwar Albany <a href="../../trades/medical.html">medical</a> community.

<p>In December 1807, he <a href="http://albany.nygenweb.net/bio-56.htm">married</a> Albany native Maria Fonda at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. At least four of their seven children became prominent residents.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> and afterwards, his household was configured on the Albany census. Through those years, his holdings on Market Street were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">valued</a> substantially.


<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=%22townsend+charles%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22townsend%20charles%22&f=false">1813</a>, "Charles D. Townsend" was listed as physician living probably in the same building at varying addresses on North Market Street. 

<p>During the early 19th century, Townsend was recognized as a leader of the Albany medical establishment.  He treated the poor and was known for service in the emerging field of "public health." He served on various Boards and also <a href="../../doc/sl1825drc.html">supported</a> a number of Albany-based organizations.    

<p>His character was <a href="#char">considered</a> by a number of contemporaries. One of them noted that:
<blockquote><font size=-1> 
        <p>"For forty-five years, until near the period of his death, he was extensively 
          engaged in practice, rendering alike service to the poor and the rich. 
          He was a physician of the olden school, positive and unequivocal in 
          his attachment to the theory and practice of medicine as taught at the 
          beginning of the present century, unfaltering in his devotion to his 
          profession, and heroic in its defense. 
        <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Previous to his death Dr. Townsend was afflicted with cataract [sic], which so impaired his vision as to oblige him to relinquish the duties of his profession, and assume the position of patient. He submitted to an operation for the removal of the disease which proved only partly successful. As a patient he displayed great fortitude and cheerfulness, and rigidly adhered to the directions of his medical attendants."</font size></blockquote>

<p>Another contemporary testified: 
<blockquote><font size=-1>  
<p>The following estimate of Dr. Townsend is from one, whose intimate relations with him afforded every opportunity to judge correctly of his character and virtues. "Industry, firmness, truthfulness, moral courage and Christian charity were blended in his character. Though possessing quickness of temper and fearlessness in the expression of his sentiments, he still possessed that nobleness of nature that when convinced of error manfully acknowledges it, and makes all reparation in its power. In the duties of his profession he would encourage and cheer his patients until all hope for them was gone, and so great was his spirit of hopefulness that it became almost proverbial, that when Dr. Townsend gave up there was indeed no hope. Then did he remember his duty as a Christian, make his suffering patients the subject of his private petition, and by prayer with them and Christian counsel point them to the Great Physician of Souls." And it was with unshaken faith and confidence in his Saviour that he himself at length entered fearlessly the dark valley, and with Unfaltering trust approached his grave."</font size></blockquote>

<p>Charles D. Townsend died in December 1847 at the age of sixty-nine. He was identified as "a practicioner of medicine". His will passed probate in Albany County in January 1848. His nephew followed in his namesake's footsteps but to a much <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=66907782">different fate</a> in Ohio. In February 1860, the Albany newspaper reported the death of "Elizabeth Butler" age 99 - "formerly a <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slave</a> in the family of Ch. D. Townsend."
