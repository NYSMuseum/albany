<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelius Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in February 1763. He was the son of <a href="jotbroeck55.html">John C.</a> and <a href="../g/sagansevoort4672.html">Sara Gansevoort</a> Ten Broeck. This eldest son grew up in a large family in the Market Street home of a prominent merchant and community leader. <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89066363458;view=1up;seq=172">Cur</a>iously, eight of these Ten Broecks died unmarried. This individual is frequently referenced as "Cornelius J. Ten Broeck." With a number of same-named <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&q=%22cornelius+ten+broeck%22&oq=%22cornelius+ten+broeck%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i22i30k1.350.5463.0.5611.23.22.0.0.0.0.347.2731.0j15j0j2.17.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..6.17.2724.0..0j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i20k1.-D1jSBgSwxI">contemporaries</a>, we exercise caution in the assignment of qualitative information.

<p>Perhaps he was one of the three men enumerated in the third ward household of his father in <a href="../../census1790.html#55">1790</a>. Thus, he would have been the "Cornelius Ten Broeck whose personal property was valued modestly under his father's <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> house in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#55">1788</a>. 

<p>In August 1797, "Cornelius" owned a house <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> that was rented to newcomer <a href="../d/sidjard.html">Simon De Jardin</a> and others but was destroyed by a <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">raging fire</a>. 

<p>He does not seem to be among the Albany residents included in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22ten+broeck%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22ten%20broeck%22&f=false">1813</a>.

<p>Cornelius J. Ten Broeck is said to have died unmarried at the end of November 1814.

<p>This well-born Albany native seems to have left only a faint impression on the community landscape. Perhaps the <a href="../../fhg.html#tbg">state</a>ment that he died unmarried and at the age of fifty-one accounts for that perception. At this point, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">surmise</a> that he lived under the family umbrella. </p>
