        <a href="#sources"><strong>Catharina Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born 
        in September 1715. She was the daughter of <a href="dtbroeck33.html">Dirck</a> 
        and <a href="../c/mgtcuyler591.html">Margarita Cuyler</a> Ten Broeck. 
        She grew up in a large and prosperous family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In September 1739, she married Albany native <a href="../l/jolivingston5017.html">John 
        Livingston</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        Over the next two decades, at least nine children were christened in Albany 
        and at churches in New York City and elsewhere. 
      <p>After more than a decade of living in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> of Albany, these Livingstons removed to New York and then to 
        Montreal where John Livingston found success and was widely known as a 
        merchant and trader. 
      <p>In 1774, these Livingstons left Canada and settled on family property 
        north of the Mohawk in what is today called "Stillwater." By that time, 
        Catharina and her husband had <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">inherited</a> 
        land in the <a href="../../na/sarapat.html">Saratoga Patent</a>. Their 
        <a href="../l/jalivingston8605.html">son</a> became an important officer 
        in the Revolutionary army. 
      <p>Fleeing before the British invasion of 1777, Catharina's family fell 
        back to the safety of their Albany property. After the war, they returned 
        to Stillwater where John Livingston died in 1791. After that, Catharina 
        came to live with her daughter in Albany. 
      <p>Catharina Ten Broeck Livingston died in Albany in April 1801.</p>
