          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Dirck Ten Broeck</B></A> was born in 1686. 
            He was the eldest son of Albany businessman <a href="wtbroeck83.html">Wessel 
            Ten Broeck</a> and his wife, <a href="../l/caloock5934.html">Catharina 
            Loockermans</a> Ten Broeck. He grew up in his father's riverside home 
            and at his grandfather's country estate located within Livingston 
            Manor.</P>

          <P>He married Albany native <a href="../c/mgtcuyler591.html">Margarita Cuyler</a> 
            in 1714. Over the next twenty-four years, the union produced twelve 
            children who were baptized at the Allbany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> where both parents were members, frequent baptism sponsors, 
            and where Dirck served as a <a href="../../drc.html#deacons">deacon</a>.</P>

          <p>Following a family formula for success, this <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#33">Albany 
            mainstay</a> was known as an <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian 
            trader</a>. In 1715, he was named "Inspector of Skins." During the 
            1720s, he held a provincial appointment as "farmer of the excise" 
            (tax collector). He also served in the Albany <a href="#militia">militia</a>.</p>

<p>In 1716, he followed his father to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> - being elected assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1722, he was elected alderman. In 1728, he was commissioned recorder of the city by the provincial  governor. After serving many years as alderman, <a href="../../cia.html">Indian commissioner</a>, recorder, and member of the provincial Assembly from 1728 to 1737, Dirck Ten Broeck was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html#dtb">mayor of Albany</a> in 1746. He served two terms.</p>

          <p>Inheriting substantial real estate from his father, Dirck Ten Broeck expanded 
            those holdings in Albany and beyond. In 1722, he sold a portion of 
            his Pearl Street property to the Dutch church. During the three decades 
            of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a>, he was involved in the cutting 
            and sawing of lumber on his wilderness property. During that time, 
            he also helped oversee Albany's interests at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>.</p> 

<p>In November 1737, "Dirck Wesselse" witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">wiill</a> of an Albany neighbor.

          <p>Calling himself an "Albany merchant," Dirck Ten Broeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> 
            in 1748. It devised his estate to Margarita during her life and then 
            divided his substantial holdings among seven promising progeny. Dirck 
            Ten Broeck died in January 1751 and was buried beneath the Dutch church. 
            He had just passed his sixty-fourth birthday. His <a href="../c/mgtcuyler591.html">widow</a> 
            enjoyed the estate until her death in 1783!</p>
