<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerritje Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in 1710. On September 17, she was christened in the Dutch church in New York City as the daughter of Albany residents <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt</a> and <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje Van Schaick</a> Ten Eyck. By 1728, that marriage appears to have produced ten children.

<p>Coenradt and Gerritje Ten Eyck were Albany mainstays until their deaths in 1753 and 1756 respectively. 

<p>However, in August 1728, those parents christened their last child - another <a href="geteyck4869.html">Gerritje</a> who was baptized at the Dutch church in Albany. That same-named daughter, married in 1752, raised a large family in Albany, and survived until 1782.

<p>On  September 12 1743, her father noted in his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=D55TAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=Gerritie+Ten+Eyck&source=bl&ots=PP5Jy2uUf6&sig=03X3zOdXOhw26wB7Xk25drkKqTQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yGBmUvnjEdja4AOt8oDgCQ&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">bible</a> that "then my daughteer Gerritje died." She was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on November 13.

<p>A subsequent <a href="#entry">bible entry</a> yielded ". . . and was buried which our hearts feel a more of God's will and I am contented with the separation for she was a lovely child in her mother's eyes."

<p>This Gerritje apparently lived for thirty-three years.</p>
