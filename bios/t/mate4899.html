<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Ten Eyck</b></a> was born in May 1708. She was the daughter of <a href="barte4811.html">Barent</a> and <a href="../s/coscher5488.html">Neeltie Schermerhorn</a> Roseboom. Her father was a rising <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> and her mother the daughter of a regionally prominent <a href="../s/schermerhorn.html">family</a>. However, their ascendancy was halted by the death of Barent Ten Eyck in January 1710. In 1716, she was left part of her grandmother's <a href="../../wills/willgeercoey.html">estate</a>.</p>


<p>In October 1734, Maria married businessman <a href="../r/heroseboom1659.html">Hendrick M. Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1746, five children had been christened at the church where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>These Rosebooms lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> - the home of many of both of their Albany kinfolk. Their marriage may have lasted for several decades after the birth of their children.</p>

<p>Maria Ten Eyck Roseboom <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~markfreeman/teneyck.html">may</a> have lived until 1790!</p>
