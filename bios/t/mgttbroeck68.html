<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Margarita Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in July 1776. She was the youngest surviving daughter of Albany leaders <a href="abtbroeck6.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../vr/elvr5068.html">Elizabeth Van Rensselaer</a> Ten Broeck. Her parents represented regionally elite families enabling her to grow up in a comfortable Market Street <a href="../../census1790.html#6">townhouse</a> and at Van Rensselaer properties in the surrounding <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">countryside</a>.

<p>Coming of age during the 1790s, Margarita does not appear to have married. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a>, her health worked against that right of passage into adulthood.

<p>In March 1809, she was identifed as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willabtbroeck6.html">will</a> filed by her father. Thus, she ultimately would receive east bank acreage and a proportional share of her parents' estate. 
 
<p>However, she would not survive long enough to enjoy the fruits of her family fortune. Calling herself a resident of the "Colonie," thrity-six-year-old Margaret Ten Broeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willmgttbroeck68.html">will</a> in June 1812. It named her "dear friend" <a href="../l/jelansing3438.html">Jeremiah Lansing</a> as executor. She died in August of that year.
