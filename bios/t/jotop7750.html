      <P>The second Federal census of <a href="../../census1800.html#7750">1800</a> 
        listed the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of <a href="#sources"><b>John 
        Top</b></a>. Calling him "a free Negro," his household consisted of six 
        "<a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free people of color</a>." 
      <p><a href="#svinin"><img src="../../images/jpg/svininfiddlerdet.jpg" align=right width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=2 alt="fiddler at a roadside tavern"></a>John 
        Topp's home was located in the heart of the old <a href="../s/sschuyler8492.html#southend">South 
        End</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house 
        and lot were valued modestly. Beginning with the first published <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city 
        directory</a> in 1813, he was identified as a musician at 5 Ferry Street 
        - a location close to the Albany waterfront. Perhaps he was a fiddler 
        similar to the individual <a href="#svinin">depicted</a> by <a href="http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Pavel_Petrovich_Svinin">Pavel 
        Svinin</a>, a young Russian diplomat and contemporary artist who <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis_Krimmel">presented</a> 
        interesting American life scenes based on his travels in the United States 
        during the second decade of the nineteenth century. 
      <p>By 1815, Top's Afro-Albanian neighbors were <a href="../../map/blackhouseholds1815.html">clustered</a> 
        in four households around the South <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>. 
      <p>John Top's household was configured on the census of 1830. In that year, 
        he was listed in the directory on <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South 
        Pearl</a> Street. Perhaps Albany residents <a href="letop7751.html">Lewis</a> 
        and William H. Top[p] were his kinsmen. We seek defining information on 
        his origins and ultimate fate!</p>
