<strong>Richard S. Treat</strong></a> was born in August 1769. He was the son of New York City residents Joseph and Elizabeth Woodruff Bryant Treat. His Pennsylvania-born and Princeton-educated father was a Presbyterian minister. He was almost always referred to as "Richard S." perhaps to distinguish him from a number of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qzcEAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22richard+treat%22+albany&source=bl&ots=axig_ExGRx&sig=oCGZtDVDAFtNvwBg81Yh6acu_yk&hl=en&ei=OTQlSvu4Eo6ElAeT0vjYBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1">same-named</a> contemporaries - one of whom would reside with the Shakers in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet.

<p>In 1794, he married <a href="../s/gestringer5048.html">Gertrude Stringer</a>, daughter of a prominent Albany physician. By 1802, the marriage had produced five children.

<p>Treat was an Albany-based <a href="../../trades/law.html">att</a>orney, jurist, and city official of some note over a four-decade career. We seek information on his training and precise experience.

<p>In 1797, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=icI1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA394&lpg=PA394&dq=%22richard+s.+treat%22&source=bl&ots=jRC647hNMX&sig=LBjgNoJJ-s0SQSB83fwxGALJRcI&hl=en&ei=ZTElSqHDJNmclQexve3hBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3">identified</a> as a lieutenant in the militia company of his neighbor, <a href="../w/johwendell2975.html">John H. Wendell</a>. 

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his holdings in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third</a> and second ward were valued on city assessment rolls. In <a href="../../census1800.html#rst">1800</a>, his third ward household was configured on the Albany census.


<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA91,M1">1813</a>, he was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 85 then 309 North Market Street. That would have been the small (office) <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">building</a> adjoining the grand double house of his father-in-law. He continued to practice law from there for the remainder of his life.

<p>In 1825, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willstlush.html">will</a> of his close neighbor and relative-by-marriage, Stephen Lush. 

<p>Richard S. Treat died in May 1837 at the age of sixty-eight.</p>
