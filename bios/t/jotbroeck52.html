<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born about 1683. He was a younger son in the large family of Albany founders <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> and <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">Catharina Van Buren</a> Ten Broeck. He grew up in his father's landmark Albany house and at their farm on the Roelof Jansen Kill.
 
<p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/jotbroeck52.jpg" alt="Johannes Ten Broeck - 1720" align=right width=150 height=185 border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4></a>In June 1709, he married <a href="../w/elwendell2797.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. That marriage appears to have been childless and Elizabeth died after only a few years. In June 1714, Johannes married the somewhat younger <a href="../vr/cavr5063.html">Catharina Van Rensselaer</a> - a daughter of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">lower manor</a>. By 1733, that marriage had produced thirteen children who were christened at the Albany church where their parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.

<p>These Ten Broecks lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#52">1715</a>, Johannes was a member of <a href="../s/joschuyler100.html">Johannes Schuyler's</a> Troop in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany County Militia</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#52">1720</a> and <a HREF="../../lists/list1742fl.html#52">1742</a>, he was identified as a freeholder living in Albany's first ward.

<p>In 1715, he was named in his father's <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">will</a> to inherit a number of houses, lots, and tracts of land. Following the death of Dirck Wesselse in 1717, his aged mother lived with him in Albany but probably in her <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> house. His patience was rewarded a decade later when the death of his mother placed him in charge of a great estate consisting of an array of valuable properties.

<p>In August <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=johannis+tenbroeck&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=&f=false">1737</a>, he was contracted by the <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a> to build a bridge on <a href="../../streets.html#state">Yonkers</a> Street.

<p>His substantial wealth was based on management of family <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> assets, <a href="../../econ/comec.html">trading</a>, and practice of the <a href="../../trades/weaver.html">weaver's</a> crafts - as he was listed on the census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html#194">1756</a>. As late as <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#52">1764</a>, Johannes or his namesake <a href="jotbroeck55.html">nephew</a> was identified as a merchant.

<p>He was an active member of the Albany community and held a number of <a href="../../corporation.html">civic offices</a> beginning with an appointment as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in 1712. In 1715, he was elected first ward assistant alderman. In 1723, he first was elected alderman. He held that office for many years until he was named city <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">treasurer</a> or chamberlain in 1740. In 1751, he received a share of the license to operate the cross-river <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>.

      <p>However, family-based <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Ten_Broeck-122">information</a> 
        (and as yet unverified) tells us that these Ten Broecks came to New Brunswick, 
        New Jersey about 1720. In light of a full life in Albany for four or more 
        decades, perhaps they were visitors or seasonal inhabitants there. 
      <p>In 1765, he stated that he was about eighty-two years old when questioned 
        about an <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html#will">incident</a> that occurred 
        in Albany more than fifty years earlier. Johannes Ten Broeck died some 
        time thereafter.
