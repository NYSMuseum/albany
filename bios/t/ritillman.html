<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong> Richard Tillman</strong></a> was born about 1750. He was the son of newcomer <a href="jotillman.html">John Tillman</a> and his wife, Margaret Hertz Tillman. He may have been born in North America as he does not seem to have been <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> as his father was in 1752. Richard grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> home of a prominent, German-ancestry leatherworker and innkeeper.

<p>In March 1772, he married Sara Morril at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on the development of their family as their children do not seem to have been christened at the Dutch church. 

<p>Coming of age during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> years, he served the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> in a number of <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;idno=abp1949.0002.001;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=261;size=100;page=root">ways</a> and also in the wartime production workforce.

<p>In October 1779, Richard Tillman was serving as superintendant of the "Continental Shoe Factory" in Albany. Thus he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pKMlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA384&lpg=PA384&dq=%22richard+tillman%22+albany&source=bl&ots=vGtiMEf1Jz&sig=iSvodP9s_8TJom0nuzvlW7FUNJQ&hl=en&ei=eWqjTPndL4K0lQevp4WbBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=%22richard%20tillman%22%20albany&f=false">excused</a> from military service by order of General Ten Broeck.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#rt">1779</a>, his third ward real property was valued on the city assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#rt">1790</a> and afterwards, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>In 1814 and afterwards, he was identified in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> with an address of 657 South Market Street. By the census of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, his household was enumerated in an expanded <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a>.

<p>In May 1833, he was placed on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#military">pension</a> roll for service as a "pri. and sailing master" during the Revolution. He was allotted $185 a year.

<p> Richard Tillman died in April 1838. His obituary called him "a hero of the Revolution," a long time resident of Albany, with the "character of an industrious and upright man and a worthy citizen."</p>
