      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Teller</b></a> was born about 1652. She 
        was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers 
        <a href="wmteller.html">Willem</a> and <a href="../d/mgtdonchesen.html">Margarita 
        Donchesen</a> Teller.</p>
      <p>Her first husband was <a href="../vt/abvtricht6599.html">Abraham Van 
        Tricht</a>. That marriage produced at least three children. After his 
        death, she was treated as a head of household - appearing in court and, 
        in 1689, assessed for taxes. In June, 1692, she married Albany widower 
        <a href="../vd/mewvdp.html">Melgert Wynantse Vanderpoel</a> with whom 
        she had two more children. Although misnamed, their large household was 
        configured on the city census of <a href="../../census1697.html#142">1697</a>. 
      <p>Elizabeth's second husband was dead by September 1710 when his estate 
        was <a href="../../wills/willmewvdp.html">considered</a> by the Albany 
        Mayor's Court. However, she was not mentioned in those proceedings.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Teller Van Tricht Vanderpoel was a widow again when she filed 
        a <a href="../../wills/willelizteller.html">will</a> in February 1720. 
        It passed probate in January 1726.</p>
