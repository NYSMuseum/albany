<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Stephen Tuttle</strong></a> was a member of the Master's <a href="../../org/masonic.html#st">Masonic Lodge</a> of Albany. His son and daughter 
with Mary Graham were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in January 1778 and June 1779, respectively. A <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~herblst/tuttle_family.htm">number</a> of same-named contemporaries are <a href="../qqqq.html">at risk</a> in the region.

<p>However, this individual is <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/l/a/g/Rena-M-Lagerblade/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0068.html">said</a> to have been born in New Jersey in 1733. By the late 1760s, he had re-located to <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. His marriage produced at least seven <a href="../qqqq.html">children</a> with Albany-christened Guy being a younger son. Mary Graham is <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/FL-BREVARD-GENSOC/2005-07/1120836798">thought</a> to have been his second wife and a sister of Albany resident <a href="../g/jograham8219.html">John Graham</a>.

<p>This individual was <a href="../../criteria.html">not</a> an Albany resident but was a farmer and landholder along "the <a href="../../na/kayad.html">Kayad</a>erosseras" about "47 miles from Albany." 

<p>He <a href="#my">lived</a> near Fort Edward, was appointed Justice of the Peace in 1768, served as deputy surveyor of the province under Alexander Colden. In 1772, he prepared a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA12&lpg=PA197&dq=%22stephen+tuttle%22+albany&sig=6L93y67X-uLZoVtOinEP5pMiHB4&ei=hLOpTLqKAcGC8gaYxf3RDA&ct=result&id=efoaAQAAIAAJ&ots=eB1CmolvnA#v=onepage&q=%22stephen%20tuttle%22%20albany&f=false">survey</a> of the sources of the Hudson River.

<p>His name <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_3d_reg.htm">appeared</a> along with those of other Tuttles on rosters of Revolutionary war military units. However, his <a href="../../friends.html">loyalties</a> would lie at the other extreme.

<p>In August <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LwnYfKaK4ksC&pg=PA210&lpg=PA210&dq=%22stephen+tuttle%22+albany&source=bl&ots=IREG_xPtXW&sig=-s7kzPAeEvtdjcWh6IjzY6_7juc&hl=en&ei=hLOpTLqKAcGC8gaYxf3RDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&sqi=2&ved=0CDMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">1778</a>, he posted bail for a jailed loyalist.

<p>He was known to the Albany revolutionaries as a <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/minutesalbanycou03newyrich#page/234/mode/2up">loyalist</a> and was  declared an outlaw by General Gates. Tuttle and his <a href="http://haldimand-collection.ca/?page_id=1588">family</a> joined the British in 1779 and later claimed extensive compensation for losses. In 1779, his Saratoga property was <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/ny/albany/taxlists/saratoga1779-1.txt">taxed</a> substantially.

<p>By the end of the war, Stephen Tuttle had left New York permanently. In December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA12&lpg=PA197&dq=%22stephen+tuttle%22+albany&sig=6L93y67X-uLZoVtOinEP5pMiHB4&ei=hLOpTLqKAcGC8gaYxf3RDA&ct=result&id=efoaAQAAIAAJ&ots=eB1CmolvnA#v=onepage&q=%22stephen%20tuttle%22%20albany&f=false">1785</a>, he gave testimony at Halifax. At that time he was a resident of Quebec.

<p>Stephen Tuttle died at Wallace Bay, Nova Scotia in 1818.</p>
