<strong>Cornelia Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in January 1729. "<a href="../../res/sp.html">N</a>eeltie" was the first child born in the large family of Albany natives and <a href="../../albanycounty.html">regional residents</a> Jacob and Alida Visscher Ten Eyck.

<p>In February 1756, she married <a href="../p/sapruyn3577.html">Samuel Pruyn, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1768, five children had been christened in the Albany church where she was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Pruyns lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Samuel Jr. was a prominent trader and skipper.
 
<P>"Neeltie"<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Naltie" Ten Eyck Pruyn lost her husband in December 1785. Briefly, she <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wsp">lived</a> under the household of her son. By <a href="../../census1790.html#4862">1790</a>, she was identified as the head of a third ward household. In time, her holdings at 24 <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a> included a store and space on the dock. In <a href="../../census1800.html#4862">1800</a>, her household included three slaves. By 1810, her residence was served by five slaves. City <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> called her "Eleanor." She also owned a share of property along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.

<p>The Widow Pruyn died in April 1817. Her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in June 1817. Neeltie Ten Eyck Pruyn had lived for more than seventy-eight years.</p>
