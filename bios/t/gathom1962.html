      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Gabriel Thomase (Thompson)</b></a> [additionally 
        <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as "Stridles"] probably was born 
        about 1640. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. 
      <p>In January 1662, he was in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck 
        when he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IisWAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=%22gabriel+thompson%22+stridles&source=bl&ots=mIzz4XeaeJ&sig=Ck8xgB4m8wEsSwtrqzmdNxvLdsI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv3KXUl-7XAhVDPiYKHTdhCfMQ6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=%22gabriel%20thompson%22%20stridles&f=false">signed 
        a contract</a> to work for <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Thomas Powell 
        "in breadmaking" and other things as "a good and faithful servant" for 
        two consecutive years. 
      <p>By March 1663, he had joined with two other men to lease a house in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. 
        In 1665, he rented a house from <a href="../k/joketel4639.html">Jochem 
        Ketelhuyn</a> on his own. Five years later, he purchased a houselot - 
        thus initiating city <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> 
        holdings anchored by his home on State Street. Young <a href="../l/rlivingston94.html">Robert 
        Livingston</a> boarded with him when he first came to Albany. In 1679, 
        his substantial holdings were assessed on a <a href="../../census1679.html#1962">census</a> 
        of Albany householders. 
      <p>In December <a href="https://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/files/5113/5464/7161/RutgerEstateSale12091665.pdf">1665</a>, 
        he was to receive a looking glass from the estate of <A HREF="../vw/rjvwoert2637.html">Rutger 
        Jacobsen</a>. 
      <p>In September <a href="http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/files/7614/2777/4978/Court_Minutes_of_Albany_Rennselaerswyck_and_Schenectady_1675-1680_Vol_II.pdf.pdf">1675</a>, 
        he was among those Albany men appointed constable for the next year. At 
        that time, he was one of those <A HREF="http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/files/7614/2777/4978/Court_Minutes_of_Albany_Rennselaerswyck_and_Schenectady_1675-1680_Vol_II.pdf.pdf">named</a> as commissaries and listed with the rank of ensign.
		
<p>Initially, he imported goods from New England for use in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. During the 1670s and 80s, he made frequent appearances before the Albany magistrates to defend his trading enterprises. At one time, he was the master of the sloop <i>Hopewell</i> which <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sailed</a> between the Hudson and New England.

<p>About 1678, he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Jannetje Martens. 
        Some of their children were baptized at the Albany Dutch church and the 
        last two were born in New York in 1693 and 1694. He was not listed on 
        the Albany church membership rolls but he did <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html">contribute</a> 
        financial support and witnessed the baptisms of his children in Albany 
        during the 1680s.</p>
      <p>By 1695, he had relocated to Manhattan where he was made a "freeman" 
        of New York City on August 8. An affidavit filed a year later called him 
        "a trader with the Indians" who "did live at Albany, now at New York." 
        He also was called a "captain of a company at Albany."</p>
      <p>Gabriel Thomase (Thompson) filed a will in September 1702. It mentioned 
        a son and daughters but no wife. He died later in the month. An <a href="../../wills/willgathom.html">inventory</a> 
        of his estate was taken in October and filed in April 1703.</p>
