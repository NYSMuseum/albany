<P><B>T</b>he <A href="#sources"><b>Ten Eycks</b></A> were a <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~mlbgen/Ten_Eyck_Documentd.html">German-ancestry</a> family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. Patriarch Coenradt Ten Eyck was shoemaker, tanner, and property holder in New Amsterdam who died within a few years of 1680.</P>

<P>His son, <a href="jacote4807.html">Jacob C. Ten Eyck</a> moved from Manhattan to Albany after 1664 and married farmer's daughter <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">Geertje Coeymans</a>. Jacob practiced the shoemaker's trade and died in Albany about 1693. Geertie lived in their <a href="../../census1697.html#118">Albany house</a> for several decades. Her children <a href="../../marriages.html">marr</a>ied well, prospered, and established the Ten Eyck family in Albany and in the upper Hudson region.</P>


<p>Their son,<a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt</a> (1678-1753), was a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a> and the father of ten children - eight of whom married. His son, <a href="jacte4881.html">Jacob C. Ten Eyck</a> (1705-93), was mayor of Albany in 1748. A younger son, <a href="barte4844.html">Barent</a>, was a prominent Albany silversmith. Silver objects made by Ten Eyck family members survive in museum and private collections as outstanding reminders of the family's accomplishments.</p>

<p>Arriving in Albany after 1664, the Ten Eycks were a successful and prolific Albany-based family that branched out into the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manor</a> and <a href="../../albanycounty.html">beyond</a>. Despite their late start, the Albany Ten Eycks were able to acquire considerable <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> during the eighteenth century. </p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, eight Ten Eyck households were counted in the city. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the city of Albany had seven Ten Eyck-named households. By 1800, the family was in its fourth generation in the Albany setting!</p>

<p>Follow <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/hsdec_jte.html">this link</a> to an essay on the "last Ten Eyck in Albany."</p>

<p>Ten Eyck Avenue, Ten Eyck Insurance Company, Ten Eyck Plaza, and many Ten Eycks in the Albany phone book, the family is still prominent in Albany today!</p>
