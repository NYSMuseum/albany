<P><a href="#sources"><b>Lewis Top</b></a> probably was born about 1787. He was of <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">African</a> ancestry. We seek defining information on his origins.

<p> In 1813, the first published Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> identified him as a ferryman living at 20 Union Street in Albany. In 1820, he was identified as the head of an Albany household that included no Whites but two "free" men and two "free" women. We take that to mean they were "<a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free people of color</a>!"</p>


<p>We believe he was the kinsman and neighbor of musician <a href="jotop7750.html">John Top</a>.</p>

<p>Lewis Top died in December 1838 and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Aftican Methodist Episcopal plot. Later, his stone was moved to Albany Rural Cemetery. He had lived fifty-one years!  </p>
