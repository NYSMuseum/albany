<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Ten Eyck</b></a> was born in September 1742. She was the daughter of Albany mainstays <a href="jahte4882.html">Jacob H</a>. and <a href="../w/anwendell2750.html">Anna Wendell</a> Ten Eyck. She grew up in a merchant's <a href="../../census1756.html#159">home</a> in the second ward.</p>


<p>In December 1766, she married twenty-eight-year-old <a href="../m/wilman.html">Wilhelmus Mancius</a> - a Kingston minister's son who recently had come to Albany on business. Following his marriage, Mancius settled in Albany and later became a <a href="../../trades/medical.html">physician</a> and apothecary of some repute. By 1784, their eight children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were pewholders.</p>

<p>The Doctor's family lived in a large home on <a href="../../loc/edownstate.html">Market Street</a> where he also saw patients and kept a medical supplies store. Later, the building also served as the <a href="../../org/po.html">Post Office</a>.</p> 

<p>Anna Ten Eyck Mancius lost her husband in 1808. Beginning in 1813, she was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=%22mancius+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22mancius%20widow%22&f=false">identified</a> as the principal personage living in the Mancius house at 52 Market Street (afterwards called 314 North Market) until her death in August 1816 at age seventy-four. She was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Dutch church plot of the Washington Park cemetery.</p>
