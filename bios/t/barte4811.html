<P><a href="#sources"><b>Barent Ten Eyck</b></a> was born about 1679. He was the second of four sons born to Albany newcomer <a href="jacote4807.html">Jacob C. Ten Eyck</a> and his wife, landholder's daughter <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">Geertruy Coeymans</a> Ten Eyck.</p>

<p>Following the early death of his father, the boy joined with his brother <a href="hete4818.html">Hendrick</a> to enter the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. By <a href="../../census1697.html#118">1697</a>, they were sharing a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> next to that of their widowed mother.</p>

<p>His place in Albany society seemed assured when he married <a href="../s/coscher5488.html">Cornelia Schermerhorn</a> in September 1700. By 1709, the marriage had produced six children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Barent Ten Eyck was on his way to becoming an Albany mainstay. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4811">1699</a>, he joined in a petition pledging loyalty to the King of England. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a> valued his second ward property at a substantial rate. He served on juries and was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and surveyor for the second ward in 1708 and 1710.</p>
  
<p>His rise was cut short when Barent Ten Eyck died in January 1710 at the age of thirty-one. His widow survived for a number of years afterward.</p>
