      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Tayler</b></a> was born in New York City in 
        1742. He was the son of William and <a href="#mother">Nancy Condit</a> 
        Tayler. Tayler left New York in his late teens to trade supplies at British 
        forts on the northern frontier. Using Albany as a base, he serviced <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>, 
        Fort William Henry, outposts along Lake Champlain, and also on the Mohawk 
        River. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/jotaylercolor.jpg" border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=180 alt="John Tayler - 1816" align=right></a>A 
        grandson noted he could speak <a href="#sources">"Indian Tongue"</a> and 
        that he kept a store on Lake George.</p>
      <P>In 1764, Tayler married <A href="../vv/mgtvvlk1382.html">Margarita Van 
        Valkenburgh</A>, the daughter of an Albany carpenter. Their marriage produced 
        no children. Instead, they adopted <a href="../v/mgtvernor2093.html">Margaret 
        Vernor</a>, the infant daughter of Margarita's sister, the late <a href="../vv/evvvlk1291.html">Eva 
        Van Valkenburgh</a> Vernor.</p>
      <P>These Taylers settled on a farm at Stillwater. He grew hemp and flax, 
        kept cattle, and began a lumber business. Tayler's farm produced smoked 
        meats, rope, and potash. The farm prospered and enabled him to stock his 
        store at Ballston (Ballston Spa) and his other enterprises as well. He 
        also offered more exclusive items obtained from merchants in London, New 
        York City, and Philadelphia.</p>
      <P>In 1777, the threat of British attack forced Tayler to abandon his farm 
        and move his family to safety in Albany where he was known as a storekeeper 
        as early as July 1776. The Battles of Saratoga occurred near his farm. 
        The British used the Tayler house as headquarters. He never returned to 
        Saratoga and the war thrust him into the public service. He represented 
        first Saratoga and then Albany on the county <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Safety</a> and on the Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies 
        - where he worked to identify and suppress <a href="../../friends.html">loyalists</A>. 
        Tayler further supported the war by using his farm and businesses to supply 
        meat for the Continental army. General <A href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
        Schuyler</a> appointed him Clothier General of the Northern army in 1776.</p>
      <p>By 1779, John Tayler had become an Albany mainstay with his third ward 
        property prominently configured on city assessment rolls. By <a href="../../census1790.html#1383">1790</a>, 
        he had relocated to the south side of <a href="../../loc/statestreet.html">State 
        Street</a> where he lived until his death.</p>
      <P>In 1776, he represented Albany County in the Third and Fourth Provincial 
        Congresses. He was elected to the first New York State Assembly in 1777 
        and served through 1781. In 1802, he was elected to the State Senate and 
        served until 1813. He was an Antifederalist and a political ally of Governor 
        George Clinton.</p>
      <p>Following the war, he was involved in diplomatic negotiations with the 
        Iroquois. He served on a number of boards and was active in many public 
        enterprises. He was a member and officer of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's Church</a>. He also acquired extensive real estate in Albany and 
        beyond.</P>
      <P><A href="../vv/mgtvvlk1382.html">Margaret Tayler</a> died in 1796. Their 
        adopted daughter, Peggy, and her husband Dr. <a href="../c/chcooper462.html">Charles 
        De Kay Cooper</a> and their family, now became his kinship network.</p>
      <p>Although into his fifties, Tayler's political career was on the rise. 
        In 1793, he was appointed city Recorder (deputy Mayor) and in 1797, he 
        was appointed justice of the Court of Common Pleas. During much of that 
        time, he retained his seat in the New York State Senate - serving as president 
        of the Senate in 1811.</P>
      <p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#1383">1800</a>, his first ward household 
        included two boys and perhaps a younger adult couple. As in 1790, it was 
        served by five slaves. 
      <P>Tayler was elected lieutenant governor under Daniel D. Tompkins in 1813 
        and served until 1817 when he was elected to the same office under De 
        Witt Clinton. He served until 1822. In 1817, he was acting governor for 
        four months when Tompkins resigned to become vice president.</P>
      <P>John Tayler died at home at 50 State Street in March 1829. His will left 
        extensive property and money to his daughter Peggy and her family. He 
        also made cash bequests to his extended family and to the children of 
        his political allies.</p>

This profile is based on <a href="../../cbr.html">community based resources</a> and on an analysis of the John Tayler Papers, Charles De 
        Kay Cooper Papers, and the Gertrude Lansing Papers at the New York State 
        Library; and the John Tayler Papers at the New York Public Library. Tayler 
        is the subject of a larger work by the author.</p>

 <p><a name=mother></a><B>His mother</b> is said to have been the granddaughter 
        of James Clinton of New Britain, Ulster County (now Orange County). James 
        Clinton settled in New York Colony in 1729 with his brother, Charles Clinton, 
        the father of Governor George Clinton (1739-1812), suggesting Tayler and 
        Clinton were most likely second cousins. Family history notes James Clinton's 
        daughter, Mary, married into the Condit or Condy family, and had a daughter 
        named Nancy. Nancy later married William Tayler. 
      <P> His grandson was John Tayler Cooper. See the John Tayler Papers in the 
        New York State Library, Albany, Box 1, Folder 1. Cooper wrote a biography 
        of his grandfather based on conversation he recalled.</P>
