<strong>Dirck Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in November 1765. He was the only son of Albany leader <a href="abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a> and his wife <a href="../vr/elvr5068.html">Elizabeth Van Rensselaer</a> Ten Broeck.

<p><a href="#eng"><img src="../../images/jpg/dtbroeck37.jpg" align=right width=200 border=0 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Dirck Ten Broeck - speaker of the Assembly"></a> His twin sister died before her second birthday. Son and grandson of mayors of Albany and of the lord of Van Rensselaer manor, Dirck grew up in Albany's highest circles - living in his father's house on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> and at his family's country homes.

<p>He was trained to practice law. He was admitted to the bar in 1791 and served on the Albany city council in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1793">1793</a>.


<p>But prior to his twentieth birthday, in September 1785, he married an even younger <a href="../s/costuyvesant.html">Cornelia Stuyvesant</a> at the New York City Dutch church. Perhaps due to the inordinately early marriage age of his bride, their family was very large with twelve children <a href="../../drc.html">baptized</a> in Albany and several more babies that were stillborn. 

<p>This Ten Broeck family also made its <a href="../../census1790.html#37">home</a> on Market Street. Dirck was elected to represent Albany in the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> first in 1796. In 1798, he was named speaker of the Assembly. He served in that body thru 1802. In <a href="../../census1800.html#37">1800</a>, his third ward household included three children and four servants.

<p>He inherited substantial lands upon the death of his father in 1810. However, his legal practice dictated that he spend substantial time in New York City.

<p>His wife died in Trenton, New Jersey in 1825. Dirck Ten Broeck lived until December 1832.</p>
