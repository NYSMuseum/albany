<P><a href="#sources"><b>Matthew Trotter</b></a> was born about 1760. He was the son of former British soldier <a href="jotrotter4909.html">John Trotter</a> and his wife, Albany native <a href="../h/anhogan4292.html">Anna Hogan</a> Trotter.</p>

<p>While still a teenager, he served the Revolutionary cause in several capacities. Many years later, a <a href="http://www.fortklock.com/simmsafterwar.htm">story</a> circulated that identified Matthew Trotter as a drummer boy in the American army who bandaged the wounded leg of General Lafayette at the Battle of Brandywine in 1777.  He served primarily in the Quartermaster's Department. In 1781, he was commissioned an ensign on the recommendation of Colonel and future Albany neighbor <a href="../vs/gvs.html">Goose Van Schaick</a>. He was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4914">First Regiment</a> of the Albany County militia.</p>

<p>After the war, he maintained his commission - ultimately rising to the rank of General in the New York State militia. He served through the War of 1812. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="biography in-progress"></a></p>

<p>By 1779, his property was assessed under the household of his father. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4914">1790</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was configured on the first Federal census. He <a href="../../census1800.html#4914">lived</a> on <a href="../../im/imecourt.html">Court Street</a> next door to his brother-in-law and partner <a href="../w/jowwendell2954.html">John W. Wendell</a>.</p>

<p>By 1789, he had married <a href="../w/mgtwendell3040.html">Margarita Wendell</a>. In November, their first son was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1800, his Court Street household included three sons and four slaves.</p>

<p>This Albany mainstay was in business with the Wendells and also was known as a mariner and skipper of a Hudson River sloop. In 1786, he took title to land in Albany from his father-in-law. He served as director of a number of Albany-based organizations and later was an alderman in the newly created fourth ward.</p>

<p>Matthew Trotter died in Albany in early December 1830. His will passed probate on December 15.</p>
