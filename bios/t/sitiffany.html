      <P>Printer and publisher <a href="#sources"> <strong>Silvester Tiffany</strong></a> 
        was a resident of Albany during the late 1780s and early 1790s.

<p>He was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=evippMryHjsC&pg=PA814&lpg=PA814&dq=%22silvester+tiffany%22+albany&source=bl&ots=kRG1jBt5LK&sig=-Wwl16aWSvVIXyjjc3zjt8MVNG8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw9O-Yi_DMAhXFVD4KHRVYAog4ChDoAQg1MAY#v=onepage&q=%22silvester%20tiffany%22%20albany&f=false">born</a> in August 1759. He was the eldest son of Gideon and Sarah Dean Farrar Tiffany of Norton, Massachusetts. He grew up in a large family perhaps in the home of a physician and Patriot. These Tiffany's seemed to have moved to New Hampshire where younger siblings were born. 

      <p>Just past his sixteenth birthday, <a href="../../res/sp.html">Syl</a>vester 
        entered Dartmouth College in 1775 but left after two years. He then seems 
        to have taken up the printing trade and the calling of the journalist. 
        We seek information on this young <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a>'s 
        wartime activities <a href="../../res/origins.html">and path</a> to Albany.	
      <P>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#stiff">1788</a>, he was a boarder 
        in a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home. His kinsman, Oliver 
        Tiffany, lived there as well. In <a href="../../census1790.html#stiff">1790</a>, 
        he was the head of a Pearl Street household that included seven family 
        members and a slave. Also appearing on the census for the first ward was 
        the household of <a href="eztiffany.html">Ezekiel Tiffany</a>. 
      <p>He was a printer and publisher. In <a href="http://www.bookmaps.de/lib/all/a/n/ane_2.html">1793</a>, 
        he had an office at "<a href="../s/thspen.html">Spencer</a>'s Book Store" 
        in Albany. About that time, he also was the partner of William W. Wands. 
      <p>During the 1790s, he <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/news/18th/384.html">published</a> 
        newspapers in <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> where he 
        also had a book store. 
<P>His first wife was Frances Davis Hopkins. Their <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/applegarth/messages/83.html">daughter</a> was christened in Albany in 1797. That couple also had at least a son named George Sylvester Tiffany who later lived in Central New York. His second wife was Elizabeth Ralston - the mother of five Tiffany children.
<p>After other not successful publishing enterprises in the Troy area, by the end of 1795, Tiffany moved his family west joining his younger brothers in Upper Canada where they were printers as well. Silvester Tiffany was able to secure land grants and the appointment as "the king's printer" (or at least an assistant). He died in Canandaigua, New York in March 1811. </p>

 <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Silvester Tiffany 
        has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
        This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. It is presented here because its subject was an Albany 
        householder in <a href="../../census1790.html#stiff">1790</a>. We seek 
        defining demographic information. The essential source for his life beyond Albany is a biographical <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=evippMryHjsC&pg=PA814&lpg=PA814&dq=%22george+ramsay%22+albany&source=bl&ots=kRG1jBt5LK&sig=-Wwl16aWSvVIXyjjc3zjt8MVNG8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjw9O-Yi_DMAhXFVD4KHRVYAog4ChDoAQg1MAY#v=onepage&q=%22george%20ramsay%22%20albany&f=false">article published</a> in the <i>Dictionary of Canadian Biography</i>.
