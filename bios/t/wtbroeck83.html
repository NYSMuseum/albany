          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Wessel Ten Broeck</B></A> was born in 1664. 
            He was the eldest son in the large family of Albany patriarch <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck 
            Wesselse</a> and his wife <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">Christina 
            Van Buren</a> Ten Broeck. </P>

          <p>He married furtrader's daughter <a href="../l/caloock5934.html">Catharina 
            Loockermans</a> in 1684. Their eight children were baptized in the 
            Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were 
            members and very frequent baptism sponsors and where Wessel was a 
            <a href="../../drc.html#deacons">church officer</a>.</p>

<P>Nominally a baker, he followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> and to acquiring rural land. In 1689, he joined a number of leading Albany residents who signed a pledge of support for the authority of William and Mary - thus repudiating the pretentions of Jacob Leisler. By the 1690s, his emergence as a businessman was recognized with election to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> - first as an assistant in 1691, and then, beginning in 1697, as alderman for the third ward. By that time, his family  was well-established in its <a href="../../census1697.html#063">riverside home</a>.</P>

          <p>With the relocation of his aging <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">father</a> 
            to the countryside, Wessel spoke for the Ten Broeck family in Albany 
            circles where he remained a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#83">prominent</a> 
            businessman, <a href="#civic">civic leader</a>, <a href="#militia">militia 
            officer</a>, and churchman for the next twenty years. As an eldest son, he figured prominently in the <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1715. He retired from the city council in 1718.</p>
 
<p>Wessel Ten Broeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willwtbroeck.html">will</a> in June 1723. It named Catharina as his principal heir and listed his house and lots on Brewers (<a href="../../streets.html#market">Market</a>) Street, farms south of Albany, and substantial personal assets. He lived another twenty-four years - dying in 1747 at the age of eighty-three. His son and grandson became <a href="../../mayors.html#dtb">mayors</a> of Albany </p>

            <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 83. This profile is derived chiefly 
            from <a href="../../fhg.html#tbg">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
            resources</a>. Named for his grandfather, the first American Ten Broeck, 
            <a href="wtbroeck83.html">Wessel of Albany</a> is sometimes confused 
            with sons of his uncles of the same name.</p>

During that time, he was active in committee work, as a magistrate, and as a member of the <a href="../../cia.html">CIA</a>!
