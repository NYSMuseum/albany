He was the son of Hezekiah and Elizabeth Pettis Tracy of Norwich, Connecticut. With at least <a href="http://www.mccallroots.com/TNG/getperson.php?personID=I1088&tree=Tree_2">another</a> same-named contemporary, the father of this subject appears to have been a Patriot soldier who lost his wife in 1791 and <a href="http://www.newhorizonsgenealogicalservices.com/connecticut-genealogy/new-london/franklin_connecticut_congregational_church_death_records_1782-1860.htm">died</a> in Norwich in 1817. 

<p>In January 1791, this subject appears (given as "Gurdon Tracy" in the Franklin, CT Congregational <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iFpZAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=hezekiah+tracy+albany&source=bl&ots=QMXEiO-RJP&sig=cRCGWX3w-Mkbjum8-3pDjgF3Y3I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyy9GlxcjYAhWNulMKHSChAHsQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&q=hezekiah%20tracy%20albany&f=false">church records</a>) to have married <a href="../../yankinv.html">Mass</a>achusetts native <a href="../p/eupackard.html">Eunice Packard</a>, daughter of a newcomer Albany <a href="../p/ispackard.html">carpenter</a>. The union produced two children - born in 1798 and '99. However, the marriage would not be a long one as Eunice Tracy died in 1801.

      <p>By the end of century, Tracy had settled in Albany. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, 
        his personal property was assessed perhaps under the second ward home 
        of <a href="../c/jacassidy7568.html">James Cassidy</a>. His widowed mother 
        was taxed (personal property only) at that location as well. In <a href="../../census1800.html#hetr">1800</a>, 
        Hezekiah was identified as head of that household which included a boy 
        under ten and a couple born between 1756 and 1774. 
      <p>After that, his name has not yet been encountered during our sweeps of 
        community and Internet based resources. 
      <p>After little more than a decade in Albany, traditional sources state that he returned Connecticut. While not actively pursuing it, we still <a href="../qqqq.html">welcome</a> information on his subsequent life.


<p>Hezekiah Tracy is <a href="https://wikitree.com/wiki/Tracy-109">said</a> to have died in Norwich in July 1829.</p>
