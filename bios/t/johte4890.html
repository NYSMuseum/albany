<strong>Johannes H. Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in October 1710. He was the son of <a href="hete4818.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/mgtbleecker210.html">Margarita Bleecker</a> Ten Eyck. To prevent confusion with several same-named kin, he was known as "Johannes H. Ten Eyck."

<p>In May 1746, he was almost thirty-six when he married a much younger <a href="satbroeck80.html">Sara Ten Broeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1758, four children had been christened in Albany where both parents were members, pewholders, and regular baptism sponsors. However, none of their offspring survived past childhood. His <a href="http://www.onentofl.com/chbibleteneyckjoh.html">bible</a> documents his family life.

<p>By the 1750s, he had settled permanently in Albany where Johannes H. Ten Eyck was elected alderman for the third ward beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1753">1753</a>. During the <a href="../../org/cc.html#1742">1740s</a>, he had served as assistant alderman. These Ten Eycks lived in a comfortable house in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#60">1756</a>, he was identified as an <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian Trader</a> - a fast disappearing type of businessman who engaged Native hunters on their own turf or at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> or Niagara. Perhaps he spent earlier years on the frontier while his father held down the Albany end of the Ten Eyck family business. By the <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4890">1760s</a>, he was in his fifties and more identified with the Albany-based business community.

<p>He held additional lots on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> and was involved in a number of civic initiatives during the 1760s <a href="../../im/im1770.html">and</a> 70s.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a>, he was appointed <a href="../../corporation.html">recorder</a> and seems to have held that office for the remainder of the the colonial period. In 1775, he was identified as a <a href="../../albanycounty.html">county</a> judge.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities, he was elected to represent the third ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. During that time, he also served as <a href="../../cia.html">Indian commissioner</a>.

<p>After the war, Johannes and Sara <a href="../../census1790.html#4890">lived</a> more quietly <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4890">next</a> to his aging brother in their Market Street home.    


<p>Johannes H. Ten Eyck filed a <a href="../../wills/willjote4890.html">will</a> in May 1792. With no living children, it named his wife, nieces, and nephews as his heirs. He died on July 31, 1794 and was buried on the next day. He was a few days shy of his eighty-second birthday. His widow survived until 1801.</p>
