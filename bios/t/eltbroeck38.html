<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Ten Broeck</b></a> was born during the early 1670s. She was the daughter of Albany leader <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> and <a href="../vb./chvburen29.html">Christina Van Buren</a> Ten Broeck. She grew up in a large family living at the top of the early Albany socio-economic ladder.</p>


<p>In December 1698, she married baker/businessman <a href="../c/antcoster5968.html">Anthony Coster</a>. By 1716, the marriage had produced four children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member and a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Even before the wedding, Coster was <a href="../../census1697.html#097">living</a> in a State Street house next to that of his future father-in-law. The marriage and subsequent family would evolve in close proximity to the Ten Broecks who would be able to assist Elizabeth's husband in realizing his ambitions<a href="../c/antcoster5968.html#ambition">!</a></p> 

<p>Anthony Coster's death in 1753 ended a long marriage of over fifty years. Elizabeth Ten Broeck Coster died in May 1757 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church.</p>
