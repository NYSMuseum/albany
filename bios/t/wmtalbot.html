<strong>William Talbot</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> "Tolbert") seems to have been born before 1755. We seek information on his origins, early life, and path to Albany residency.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war years</a>, a William Talbot was listed as an <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_1st_reg.htm">enlisted</a> man on a roster for the first regiment of the New York Line. We seek additional infomation on his wartime service. 

<p>In March 1777, he was in Albany when he married Anna (<a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jachix/hicks/pafg79.htm#2029">Hannah</a>) Young at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as young people "of this city." By 1801, at least seven children had been christened at Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1785">1785</a> and '86, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wt">1788</a>, his modest personal holdings were valued on the Albany assessment roll in the third ward. By <a href="../../census1790.html#wt">1790</a>, he was counted among the heads of household in the first ward (probably in the area between Market/Court Street and the river). In <a href="../../census1800.html#wt">1800</a>, his household was enumerated on the Albany census in the second ward. His household also was on the Albany census in 1810.

<p>City directories listed him as a laborer living on Van Schaick and then Montgomery Streets. In 1813, a Philip Talbot was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#v=onepage&q=talbot&f=false">listed</a> in the directory at 16 Van Schaick. Later, an Elizabeth Talbot lived at the 16 Van Schaick Street address.

<p>William Talbot was dead by February 23, 1820 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on his estate.
