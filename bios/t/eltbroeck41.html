<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in August 1772. She was the eldest surviving daughter of <a href="abtbroeck6.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../vr/elvr5068.html">Elizabeth Van Rensselaer</a> Ten Broeck. She was born to parents who <a href="../../marriages.html">represented</a> the region's landed and business elites. She grew up in the comfort of her father's town house on <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">Market Street</a>. 

<p>In February 1793, Elizabeth was in Philadelphia where she married <a href="../s/renschuyler.html">Rensselaer Schuyler</a>. Although their union lasted more than fifty years, it does not apprear to have produced children.

<p>In 1810, she was named among the heirs identified in the <a href="../../wills/willabtbroeck6.html">will</a> filed by her father. In August 1812, she was left the entire estate of her unmarried younger sister Margaret - the principal part being a third of Abraham Ten Broeck's holdings. 

<p>These Schuylers made their home on the upper Hudson where Rensselaer is said to have been one of the initial developers of Stillwater.

<p>Rensselaer Schuyler died in 1847 and was buried at Stillwater in December. A few months later, Elizabeth Ten Broeck Schuyler passed on as well. She was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6965907">buried</a> with her husband in April 1848.</p>
