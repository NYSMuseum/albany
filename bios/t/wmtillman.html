<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Tillman</strong></a> probably was born about 1750. Although <a href="../../res/guess.html">prob</a>ably related, we have yet to connect him to the <a href="http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.tillman/1020/mb.ashx">family</a> of <a href="../ger.html">German</a>-born patriarch <a href="jotillman.html">John Tillman</a> who emigrated to America in 1752. A number of same-named individuals are at risk.

<p>In August 1775, he married Charity Hutchins at the First <a href="http://www.history.pcusa.org/collections/findingaids/fa.cfm?record_id=413">Pres</a>byterian Church of New York City. At that time, he was identified as "of Albany" and she as "of New York." The marriage is said to have produced children.

<p>William Tillman <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the American <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olution. He was an ensign and then lieutenant in the third and then first Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">regiments</a>. Afterwards, Lieutenant Tillman was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#witi">1790</a>, he was listed on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. At that time, his household included seven people.

<p>After that, the name of William Tillman has not been encountered during our sweep of <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. With so many outstanding questions, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now! </p>
