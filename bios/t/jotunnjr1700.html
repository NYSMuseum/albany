<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Tunnicliff, Jr.</b></a> was born in England about 1750. He was a younger son of <a href="jotunn1683.html">John</a> and Elizabeth Tunnicliff. A goldsmith by trade, he came to America during the War for Independence where he was reunited with his <a href="jotunn1683.html">father</a> - a then-vulnerable pioneer of the New York wilderness.</p>


<p>He married twice - first to an unknown English woman. His second marriage to Hannah Hudson in 1774 produced fourteen children - many of whom were baptized in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's church</a> where he was a member.</p>


      <p>During the war years, he divided his time between his father's farms at <a href="../../na/whitehall.html">Whitehall</a> 
        and in the Unadilla Valley. He served the revolutionary cause and later 
        was awarded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> as a member 
        of the Albany regiment of the county militia.</p>

<p>After the war, he settled in Albany where he earned a living as a watchmaker. During the 1780s, he was paid by the Albany government for repairing the city clock. His jewelry store at 16 State Street was advertized in the pages of the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. His household was configured on the Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#1700">census of 1790</a>. He also leased land west of Albany from the city government.</p>


<p>After a decade in Albany, in 1793 he removed to a farm in Richfield Springs where he lived out his life. John Tunnicliff, Jr. died in July 1814 in Warren, Herkimer County. </p>
