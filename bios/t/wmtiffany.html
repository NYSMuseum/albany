<strong>William Tiffany</strong></a> was a painter living in Albany during the second decade of the nineteenth century. He probably was of New England origins. Perhaps he was the son of <a href="eztiffany.html">Ezekiel</a> and Margaret Tiffany.

<p>From 1813 thru 1820, he was listed in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">Directories</a> as a painter at various addresses on Sand, Fox, South Pearl Streets, and on Store Lane. His shop was located at 128 State Street and on Hamilton and also South Market Streets.

<p>In 1815, he was living at the same address (107 Fox) as the <a href="eztiffany.html">widow</a> Margaret Tiffany.


<p>We recognize that this sketch of William Tiffany is premature. It appears here in hopes of stimulating discussion regarding his origins, life, and passing.</p>
