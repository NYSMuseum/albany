<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anthony C. Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in June 1712. He was the son of <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt</a> and <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje Van Schaick</a> Ten Eyck. He grew up as a middle child in the large family of an Albany silversmith. Several of his <a href="jacte4881.html">sib</a>lings became prominent residents of Albany and its environs. However, at least two other Anthony Ten Eycks are generally <a href="../qqqq.html">at risk</a> during his effective lifetime.

<p>This Anthony, however, <a href="../../res/guess.html">may</a> have re-located to New York and <a href="../../res/ts.html">appears</a> to have established himself as a merchant.

<p>In December 1740, he married his second cousin Sara Ten Eyck in New York City. Following Sara's death in March 1758 (and after six births), he married Margarita Van Wyck, the widow of Brandt  Schuyler, in Red Hook. By 1762, seven children were <a href="http://clanwaddell.com/family/family/getperson.php?personID=I140783&tree=10283">accounted</a> for in the two marriages. During the 1740s and '50s, he witnessed a number of baptisms in  Albany.

<p>During the 1750s, he is said to have owned the sloop <i>Christina</i> with his brother <a href="tote4907.html">Tobias.</a>

<p>Following the death of his first wife and subsequent re-marriage, he is said to have moved to southern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> (<a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Co</a>eymans) where he was a part of family-based business and social networks. Even prior to those years, he was mentioned in a number of related wills. In June 1754, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willsacoeymans.html">estate</a> of his kinsman Samuel Coeymans under which his widowed mother received a substantial bequest. In September 1763, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willcavschaick4007.html">estate</a> of Samuel's widow.

<p>Anthony C. Ten Eyck filed a <a href="../../wills/willantte.html">will</a> in April 1775. At that time, he identified himself as a resident of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and as "weak in body." It named his wife and three living children as heirs. This complicated document passed probate in June. 

<p>Afterwards, his widow returned to Red Hook and survived until 1777. However, this 
Anthony Ten Eyck appears to have been named (but probably not still living) in the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtte.html">will</a> filed by his sister in October 1782.  Until we can verify his death date, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>

Because so much of this Albany native son's life evolved <a href="../../na/na.html">beyond</a> an Albany city context, we have relied on traditional sources to flesh out his story and have not pursued his non Albany life into primary source research.
