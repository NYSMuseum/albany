<strong>Catherine or Christina Temper</strong></a> was born about 1748. She is <a href="#dau">said</a> to have been the daughter of Jacob Tremper of Kingston. However, a number of sources have held that instead this individual was named Christina and that she was the daughter of Henry Tremper of Philadelphia.


<p>During the late 1760s, she married European emigrer <a href="../m/jomaley.html">John Maley</a>. Perhaps after a time in New York, the couple settled in Albany where their  <a href="../m/hamaley.html">daughter</a> was christened in 1769.

<p>As he prospered quickly, the Maleys lived in a landmark <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">house</a> on North <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> from where John Maley ran an import business.

<p>Catherine/Christina Temper Maley lived into her sixties but was dead by the time letters of administration were issued on her husband's estate in June 1812.</p>

The life of Catherine/Christina Temper Maley has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. A portrait of Catherine was done by Albany artist <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra Ames</a> shortly before her death. 

<p><a name=dau>We are not certain of Mrs. Maley's parentage or of her first name for that matter. She may have been the daughter of a Pennsylvania merchant and land speculator who had a number of real estate dealings with John Maley. However, in <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~degroff/pafn490.htm">1795</a>, John Maley was made co-administrator of the estate of Jacob W. Tremper of Kingston. Thus, we remain flexible on her origins.
