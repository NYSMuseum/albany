<strong>Andries Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in December 1718. He was the son of <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt</a> and <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje Van Schaick</a> Ten Eyck. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a prominent silversmith and businessman. His older <a href="jacte4881.html">brother</a> was named mayor of Albany in 1748.

<p>About 1749, he married Anna Margarita Coeymans. She died in 1760. In July 1763, he married the widow Jannetje Schermerhorn Jansen. By 1772, the two marriages had produced seven children who were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

He also paid taxes on property (probably on Schodack Island) in the East Manor of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. He owned a Hudson River sloop with his brother and served as a justice of the peace as early as 1756. He most often was identified as a "farmer."

<p>In 1779, his son was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjobarclay.html">will</a> filed by his brother-in-law, Mayor <a href="../b/jobarclay.html">John Barclay</a>. In 1782, he was named in the will filed by his widowed <a href="anmgte4836.html">sister</a>.

<p>In 1786, he sold two lots on the south side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> - thus ending his direct connection to the city. In 
<a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his Rensselaerwcyk household included five family members and four slaves. In 1796, he was involved in a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uok4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA35&lpg=PA35&dq=%22andries+ten+eyck%22&source=web&ots=90LpowLrO1&sig=0TXNvKKZmaA1D70aBUM8mUO8gCk">court case</a> regarding his lands at Coeymans.


 
 <P>Andries Ten Eyck died in October 1802. He had lived almost eighty-three years.

<p>A substantial legacy of his holdings has recently been <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/press/2006/preservingfamily.cfm">exhibited</a> at the New York State Museum.</p>
