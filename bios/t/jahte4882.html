<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob H. Ten Eyck</b></a> was born in January 1708. He was the son of Hendrick and Margarita Bleecker Ten Eyck.</p>


      <p>He married <a href="../w/anwendell2750.html">Anna Wendell</a> in November 
        1737 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both 
        parents were members and occasional baptism sponsors. By 1750, six children 
        were baptized at the Albany church.</p>

<p>He was an <a href="../../census1756.html#159">Albany mainstay</a> who was known as "Jacob H. Ten Eyck" to prevent confusion with a number of contemporary "Jacob Ten Eycks" in Albany and its hinterland. This Jacob Ten Eyck was a highly visible Albany officeholder. He served as assistant alderman in the second ward from 1739 to 1743 and as 
<a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> from 1746 to 1748. From 1759 to 1775, he represented Albany in the <a href="../../org/ass.html">provincial Assembly</a>. That office kept him from Albany for extended periods of time during his forties and fifties.</p>

<p>His livlihood came from business and shipping. In <a href="../../lists/list1764.html">1764</a>, he joined other Albany merchants in petitioning the provincial government regarding the Indian trade. By the mid-1760s, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> property ranked among the most valuable on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. He also held lots in other parts of the city!</p>

<p>Jacob H. Ten Eyck died in November 1776 at the age of sixty-eight. However, his will did not pass probate until December 1794. His son was colonial sheriff <a href="heteyck4875.html">Hendrick Ten Eyck, Jr.</a></p>
