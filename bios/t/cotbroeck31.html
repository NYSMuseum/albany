<strong>Cornelis Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born in March 1706. He was the last of nine children born to the marriage of <a href="wtbroeck83.html">Wessel</a> and <a href="../l/caloock5934.html">Catharina Loockermans</a> Ten Broeck. He grew up in the <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home of a prominent Albany businessman and civic leader. In 1723, he was named co-executor of his father's <a href="../../wills/willwtbroeck.html">estate</a>.


<p>In October 1733, Cornelis married <a href="../c/macuyler596.html">Maria Cuyler</a> at her father's Albany home. Their family was small with only a <a href="jotbroeck55.html">son</a> and a <a href="catbroeck7.html">daughter</a> living long enough to raise their own families.  Both parents, however, were prominent members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>This Ten Broeck family first lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Cornelis qualified to vote in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#31">1742</a> and later in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#31">1763</a>. He was a "<a href="../../census1756.html#276">skipper</a>" (shipper), <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#31">trader</a>, and businessman whose Albany holdings were valued in the top five percent on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. By that time, he had settled permanently in the third ward.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1738">1738</a>, he was appointed firemaster. But in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1760">1760</a>, he was elected alderman for the third ward. He was re-elected for the next five years. His virtual absence from community rolls for the 1740s and 1750s may indicate that he was involved in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian trade</a> on the frontier. However, during the 1760s, he was an active participant in Albany-based  business and government. He owned or leased a number of city <a href="../../res/realestate.html">parcels</a> and was particularly involved with the development of the city docks during that time.

<p>He also held <a href="../../res/realestate.html">acreage</a> in a number of frontier partnerships including the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga Patent</a>.

<p>Cornelis Ten Broeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willcotbroeck31.html">will</a> in March 1771. He died in January 1773 - a few months shy of his sixty-seventh birthday. His widow survived for many <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#596">more</a> years.</p>
