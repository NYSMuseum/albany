<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry Truax</strong></a> was born in October 1761. He was the second surviving son (two earlier Hendricks died) of Isaac <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~truax/assoc/descend/dutr0004.htm#id873">a</a>nd <a href="../r/suroseboom1955.html">Susanna Roseboom</a> Truax. His family was from <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> but was living in Montreal at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. His older brother was Albany merchant <a href="isitruax1959.html">Isaac I. Truax</a>. 

<p>In 1769, he among those noted in the <a href="../../wills/willheroseboom1663.html">will</a> filed by his bachelor <a href="../r/heroseboom1663.html">uncle</a> - an Albany resident.

<p>Not yet fifteen at the onset of hostilities, Henry Truax would serve in the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">Rev</a>olutionary army where he <a href="../../res/ts.html">s</a>ometimes was referred to as "Harry." We seek more definitive information on his wartime activities. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#ht">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.</p>


 
<p>After the war, he settled in Albany. In March 1783, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willgeewendell2872.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#ht">1788</a>, his personal property was valued under the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> house of his widowed mother. His brother also lived in the Market Street home.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1790.html#ht">1790</a>, his third ward household was configured on the Albany census. In <a href="../../census1800.html#ht">1800</a>, his household included two young girls and Truax and his wife. City <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment rolls</a> valued his Market Street home and lots in the first ward as well.  Beginning with the first directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=%22truax+henry%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22truax%20henry%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was identified as a merchant living at 67 (North) <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. 

<p>In 1789, he married <a href="../y/anyates4452.html">Ann Yates</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their children were christened there where he was a supporter, pewholder, and later a member of the Consistory. Beginning in 1800, Henry kept an account book for alms distributed by the church. In 1815, these Truaxes became members of the <a href="../../drc.html#second">Second</a> Reformed Church in Albany.

<p>In the years that followed, this Market Street merchant held a number of civic and private sector offices. In 1820, he was appointed county clerk and served for a year.


<p>Henry Truax died in December 1834 at the age of seventy-four. He was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2aQkLfnyCIIC&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=%22henry+truax%22+albany&source=bl&ots=S3VOlnCZ-q&sig=ay51krqPyjU8astBPYhnTnlz3sA&hl=en&ei=HE_lTK-aM8GclgfOvbGzCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20truax%22%20albany&f=false">buried</a> along with his deceased children in the Dutch church section of the Washington Park <a href="../../dead.html">cemetery</a>. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in December. His widow survived until 1845.</p>
