<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac Ja. Truax</b></a> was born in May 1726. He was the son of Jacob and Elizabeth La Grange Truax of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</p>


<p>In June 1750, he married <a href="../w/mawyngaert6230.html">Maria Wyngaert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1768, ten children were christened at Albany and several others were baptized elsewhere.</p>

<p>He ran the "Halfway House" tavern/inn located at the mid-point of the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">King's Highway</a> route between Albany and Schenectady. Later, he would be described as a "jolly good tavern keeper and [a] good friend" and characterized as a "very eccentric person" and disposed toward "fastidious and gaudy dress."</p>

His "old red tavern" located just inside the northern boundary of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> was an eighteenth-century landmark and stopping point on the road through the pine barrens. In 1754, he was commissioned an ensign in a Schenectady-based company of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GuH0Jp1290MC&pg=PA589&lpg=PA589&dq=%22isaac+i+truax%22&source=bl&ots=Sj_ZyDhC6k&sig=ikU_UvOTnH6k8w1Fzn1qw9vtttc&hl=en&ei=mPnvTNDNAsPflgfP67XhDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20i%20truax%22&f=false">November 1780</a>, he was identified as a tavernkeeper hen he posted a bond of fifty pounds guaranteeing the good behavior of his kinsman with the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>. </p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1678">1790</a>, his home was configued in the Watervliet section of the Federal census for Albany County. The homes of two sons were located nearby!</p>

He died in April 1808 and was buried in the <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~truax/trucem.html">family cemetery</a> created in response to instructions in his will. The will passed probate on June 19.</p>
