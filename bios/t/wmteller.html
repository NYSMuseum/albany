      <P>According to family-based <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Willem-Teller/6000000007578168233">res</a>ources, 
        <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer <a href="#sources"><b>Willem 
        Teller</b></a> was born in Edinburgh, Scotland about 1620. His <a href="#father">father</a> 
        was a German-ancestry Dutch minister. In 1638, young Willem was sent to 
        <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> by the West India Company. 
        He served in several capacities at <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort 
        Orange</a>.</p>
      <p>His first wife was <a href="../d/mgtdonchesen.html">Margaret Donchesen</a> 
        - the mother of at least nine of his children. Family <a href="http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/gen/chfmclc4.html">resources</a> 
        state that he was a Scot from the Shetland Isles and that he married Margaret 
        in Amsterdam on February 6, 1639. On April 9, 1664, he <a href="http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/church/rdcmarr1664.shtml">married</a> 
        the widow Maria Verleth Van Schrick in the New Amsterdam Dutch church. 
        At that time, he was identified as the widower of "Margariet Dunces." 
      <p>Official duties soon gave was to private enterprises. In <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6606">1660</a>, 
        his name was on a list of principal fur traders petitioning the Beverwyck 
        <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">court</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1661, he was one of the original <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~newyork43/Schenectady.html">patentees</a> 
        of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. Each of the principals 
        received a village lot and a farm on the "Great Flat" - on the south side 
        of the Mohawk and west of what became the village of Schenectady.</p>
      <p>He was well-known in both communities. In <a href="../../census1679.html#wmteller">1679</a>, 
        his Albany property was accorded one of the highest assessments on the 
        Albany tax list. 
      <p>By the early 1690s, he had shifted his focus to New York City - leaving 
        son <a href="andteller6605.html">Andries</a> in charge of his Albany holdings. 
        Willem Teller made a deposition in 1698. It stated that he was seventy-eight 
        years old. He may have died in New York in 1701.</p>

    According to family-based <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Romanus-Teller/6000000008469536742">sources</a>, 
      Romanus Teller (1588-?) also emigrated to New Netherland and is said to 
      have been at Fort Orange as well. We seek more definitive documentation.
