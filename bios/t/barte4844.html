      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent C. Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born 
        in September 1714. He was the son of Albany mainliners <a href="cote4812.html">Coenradt</a> 
        and <a href="../vs/gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje Van Schaick</a> Ten Eyck. 
        He grew up in a large family in a silvesmith's home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>. His father's business carried him to New York and to the frontier 
        where Coenradt's sons learned the silversmith's craft as well as the elements 
        of business. He sometimes was referred to as "Barent C. Ten Eyck" to prevent 
        confusion with a number of same-named kin. 
      <p>In January 1756, Barent C. married Albany native <a href="../c/elscuyler521.html">Elsje 
        Cuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He 
        was in his forties and she was twenty-seven. The marriage may have been 
        childless. However, both partners were long time church members, pewholders, 
        and baptism sponsors. 
      <p>These Ten Eycks lived in the second ward where Barent was a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a>, 
        businessman, firemaster (<a href="../../org/cc.html#1742">1742</a>, 1767), 
        and assistant alderman (<a href="../../org/cc.html#1747">1747</a>). In 
        <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4844">1763</a>, his name may have 
        appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. 
      <p>During the 1760s, 70s, and 80s, his property was valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. He was involved in a number of real estate transactions and 
        was an occasional contractor of the city. A number of references regarding 
        "Barent Ten Eyck" appear in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a>. 
      <p>In 1790, perhaps the [childless] couple were living in <a href="tote4907.html">one</a> 
        of his brothers' Watervliet <a href="../../census1790.html#4844">home</a>s. 
      <p>Barent C. Ten Eyck buried his wife in November 1791. He filed a will 
        on February 9, 1795. It named his [deceased] <a href="tote4907.html">brother</a> 
        and nephews as heirs. He died at the end of February 1795 at the age of 
        eighty. The will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> 
        on March 9.</p>
