<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Truax</strong></a> was born in October 1752. He was the eldest son of <a href="istruax1678.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../w/mawyngaert6230.html">Maria Wyngaert</a> Truax. His father operated "The Halfway House" inn along the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a> to Schenectady. A number of sons lived nearby. This individual <a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> was referred to as John W. (or Wyngaert) Truax. However, several same named contemporaries may be at-risk. This sketch aims to <a href="#wiki">focus</a> on John Truax - son of the Halfway House innkeeper.

<p>As John W. was an innkeeper himself, <a href="../../res/guess.html"> perhaps</a> he took over for his father who lived until 1808 - three years after the death of this subject.

<p>During the 1770s, he married one Magdalena Huysen (of Columbia County). Their son was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in June 1779. Subsequent children were born during the 1780s but do not appear to have been baptized in <a href="../../churches.html">Alb</a>any.


<p>In his early twenties at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, we expect to find substantial information on his <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/hanson/revwar_q_t.html" 
>activities</a> during the war years. Afterwards, John Truax  was among those accorded a land bounty right in conjunction with the Schenectady regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. 

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jotr">1779</a>, his (simply John Truax) house and holdings were valued on the Albany assessment roll in the second ward. In 
<a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jotr">1788</a>, the real and personal property of "John T. Truax" were valued in the same vicinity.

<p>In late November <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXHfeDs_6DoC&pg=PA589&lpg=PA589&dq=%22john+w+truax%22&source=bl&ots=izMUDs7biQ&sig=xklY3BfG5grWvI3GXRCQmfAwfMI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIs86_lpbXAhUq7YMKHe7kADI4ChDoAQgsMAI#v=onepage&q=%22john%20w%20truax%22&f=false">1780</a>, "John W. Truax" "of the county of Albany [-] innkeeper" was among four Truax kin those who posted a <a href="../../cddc.html">bond</a> of &pound50 for the liberty of another family member. 


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "John J. Truax" was configured on the Albany census of the second ward. However, four other householders named "John Truax" also were listed on the census in Albany County.

<p>John W. Truax "of Schenectady" was a prominent <a href="../../res/realestate.html">landholder</a> in the area along the Albany road and along the Mohawk River as well. Those properties were described in some detail in <a href="http://schenectadyhistorical.org/admin/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/First-Reformed-Church-of-Schenectady-Book-of-Indentures.pdf">Schenectady real property</a> listings. 
 
<p>In August of <a href="#will">1805</a>, Johannes W. Truax "of Schenectady" filed a <a href="https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/3:1:33SQ-GYH1-QWY?i=157&wc=Q7P3-2N5%3A213301001%2C215080201&cc=1920234">will</a>. It named his wife " Magdalene," two married daughters, a "youngest daughter", five sons, and his brother Isaac as heirs. The will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in Schenectady County in December. </p>
