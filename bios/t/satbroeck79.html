<strong>Samuel Ten Broeck</strong></a> was born about 1680. He was a son in the <a href="tbvb.html">large family </a> of Albany leader <a href="dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> and <a href="../vb/chvburen29.html">Christina Van Buren</a> Ten Broeck. He grew up in the comfortable <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> home and on the emerging east bank farm of one of the most important men in early Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#097">1697</a>, he was accounted for in his father's Albany household. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#79">1699</a>, he joined his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. However, he seems to have lived on the family farm in eastern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.

<p>In November 1712, he married <a href="../vr/mavr5096.html">Maria Van Rensselaer</a> - daughter of the Albany leader of the region's premier <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> family. By 1730, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>In 1715, he was <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">named</a> to inherit a share of his father's estate and a portion of his land on the Roeloff Jansen Kill in Livingston Manor. He settled there and raised a family that included several future residents of Albany.

<p>


<p>After more than three decades of success as an <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> farmer, Samuel Ten Broeck died in April 1756 and was buried from the Albany church.</p>
