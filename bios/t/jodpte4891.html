      <P>This <a href="#sources"><strong>John Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born in 
        October 1757. He was the third son of <a href="tote4830.html">Tobias H.</a> 
        and <a href="../d/radep7828.html">Rachel De Peyster</a> Ten Eyck. Named 
        for his prominent and long-lived <a href="../d/jodp.html">grandfather</a>, 
        John De Peyster Ten Eyck grew up in his merchant father's comfortable home in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 
      <p>In August 1774, he was among the six sons named (along with their mother) 
        in the <a href="../../wills/willtote4830.html">will</a> filed by "Tobias 
        Ten Eyck of Schenectady." 
      <p>John D.P. Ten Eyck was twenty-eight at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> 
        in 1775. By 1777, he was <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">serving</a> as 
        lieutenant and paymaster of the First Canadian Regiment commanded by Colonel 
        <a href="../l/jalivingston8605.html">James Livingston</a>. Two years later, 
        he had been promoted to captain. He retired from the military in January 
        1781. Afterwards, he received land <a href="../../guide/histres.html#bounty">bounties</a> 
        for wartime service. 
      <p>In January 1782, he married <a href="../d/madouw2162.html">Maria Douw</a> 
        - the twenty-one-year-old younger daughter of a former <a href="../d/vopdouw2234.html">mayor</a> 
        of Albany. He was a member and supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. However, the marriage may have only produced two children 
        - one of whom was named "John De Peyster Ten Eyck." 
      <p>After the war, this Ten Eyck family settled in Albany - making their 
        home in a landmark family house on <a href="../../streets.html#state">State 
        Street</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4891">1788</a>, he 
        was elected to the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>. 
        He also served as an inspector in the first ward. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4891">1790</a>, 
        his home at 82 State Street was served by four slaves. He also was a member 
        of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>. 
      <p>John De Peyster Ten Eyck died in April 1798 at the age of forty. His 
        will passed probate in 1817. Widow Maria Douw Ten Eyck lived on in their 
        State Street home until her death in 1818.</p>
