      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Harmanus Ten Eyck</strong></a> was born 
        in January 1750. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany 
        natives <a href="jahte4882.html">Jacob H.</a> and <a href="../w/anwendell2750.html">Anna 
        Wendell</a> Ten Eyck. He grew up in a wealthy merchant's home in the second 
        ward. He was an Albany mainstay for over fifty years and the only significant 
        member of his large Albany family to be named "Harmanus" - the <a href="../w/hawendell2667.html">name</a> 
        of his maternal grandfather. 
      <p>In March 1776, he married Albany native <a href="../b/mgtbleecker213.html">Margarita 
        Bleecker</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1798, the marriage had produced ten children who were christened in 
        Albany where both parents were members and occasional baptism sponsors. 
      <p>Harmanus Ten Eyck was a merchant and <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        estate</a> trader who, after a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4815">time</a> 
        in the first ward, set up his home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a>. In 1776, he was called a skipper when he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willelvr5067.html">will</a> 
        of an Albany neighbor. He was particularly active in buying and selling 
        city lots. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4815">1790</a>, his household 
        was served by two slaves - who he later freed. By <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, 
        he had settled at what became 362 North Market Street and lived there 
        for the rest of his life. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1776">1776</a> and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1788">1788</a>, 
        he served as a firemaster. In 1781, he was identified as a chimney viewer. 
        However, except for the occasional payment of his account by the city, 
        he does not appear to have been as publicly active as other merchants 
        of his standing. 
      <p>Especially during the 1790s and early 1800s, he bought and sold <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lots</a> 
        all around Albany. In August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#middle">1797</a>, 
        a great fire destroyed his stables in Middle Lane. He also traded in land 
        <a href="../../albanycounty.html">beyond</a> the city limits. 
      <p>Harmanus Ten Eyck died in 1828. His will passed probate in March. His 
        widow survived at 362 North Market Street until 1834.</p>
