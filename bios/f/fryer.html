<P>The <a href="#sources"><strong>Fryer family</strong></a> of early Albany is descended from English weaver <a href="isfryer8033.html">Isaac Fryer</a> who settled in Albany about 1720. He died in 1755, leaving a widow and four living children. The Fryers would live along <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> for several generations.

<p>Isaac Fryer's eldest son, <a href="wmfryer8035.html">William</a>, was a baker who raised a small family near his boyhood home before an untimely death while still in his forties. Captain <a href="jofryer8034.html">John Fryer</a> was an Albany mainstay for much of the mid-eighteenth century. His daughter, <a href="lyfryer2220.html">Lydia</a>, married Revolutionary stalwart Matthew Visscher. Brother <a href="isfryer8037.html">Isaac I. Fryer</a> followed his father in the weaver's craft and later operated a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> brickyard. Their sister, <a href="cafryer8036.html">Catherine Fryer</a>, (1731-91) never married but was known as a sometime <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8036">householder</a>.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#8037">1790</a>, two Fryer-named households were listed in the city of Albany. Five more were identified on the <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">census</a> for surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#8037">1800</a>, three "Fryar" named households were configured on the city census for the first ward.		
		
<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66dq=%22fryer+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22fryer%20john%22&f=false">1813</a>, four Fryer households were listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>. By 1830, five Fryer addresses remained in the annual directory.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the earliest Albany Fryers were tradesmen and transporters who intermarried with their neighbors in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.<p>

The Albany <a href="../../res/sp.html">Fryers</a> are distinct from the <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> "Freers" who settled in the lower Hudson Valley during the seventeenth century. Traditional sources <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/fryer-1.html">hold</a> that perhaps a different Fryer family emerged during the second half of the eighteenth century and inhabited the countryside west of Albany.

Family genealogical material via <a href="http://www.linkpendium.com/genealogy/USA/sur/surc-F/surc-Fry/sur-Fryer/">Linkpendium</a> is overly broad. At this point, we have found no comprehensive <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based</a> source  for the Fryers of Albany.
