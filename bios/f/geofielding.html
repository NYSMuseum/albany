<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>George Fielding</strong></a> was a New York <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a> who also lived in Albany during the middle decades of the eighteenth century.

<p>He probably was born in New York about 1710. We seek particulars regarding his background and early life. However, in April 1729, he married <a href="../r/caroseboom1591.html">Catharina Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the next twenty-five years, several of their children were christened at the Dutch church in New York City. In 1730, he was named co-executor of the letters of administration granted on the estate of Widow Deborah Fielding of New York City. Perhaps she was his mother.


<p><a href="http://62.173.116.70/partnerpages/Lot.aspx?SaleHouseID=1040824&SaleID=1112329&UNID=210819337"><img src="../../images/jpg/salverfielding.jpg" align=right hspace=4 vspace=4 width=100 border=1 alt="salver made by George Fielding"></a> In 1731, he was admitted to the freemanship of New York City and identified as a "goldsmith." However, silver pieces such as the salver pictured here and dating from about that time have survived.

<p>Beginning in 1756, his name began appearing regularly on Albany rolls. A <a href="../../census1756.html#17">census</a> of householders taken by the British army called him "Mr. Fielding" and identified him as a silversmith. Subsequent Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a> taxed his second ward holdings at a modest rate. In 1765, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/williskip.html#wit">will</a> of one of his second ward neighbors.

<p>George Fielding was last heard from in 1779. His widow's name was listed as the owner of a house in the second ward as late as <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#gf">1788</a>.</p>
