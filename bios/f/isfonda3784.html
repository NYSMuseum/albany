<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac I. Fonda</strong></a> was born in June 1723. He was the twin son and last child of <a href="isfonda3760.html">Isaac D.</a> and <a href="../l/allansing3100.html">Alida Lansing</a> Fonda. It appears that neither of his parents lived to see 1750. Sometimes, this "Isaac I." (not to be confused with contemporary <a href="isfonda3783.html">Isaac D.</a> or the younger <a href="isfonda3786.html">Isaac A.</a>) was referred to as "Isaac Fonda, Jr." 

<p><a href="http://www.eancestry.org/familygroup.php?familyID=F4291&tree=nichols">Perhaps</a> he married in February 1748. Thus, his wife was <a href="../d/codef4754.html">Cornelia De Foreest</a>. That couple christened at least five children at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1749 and 1760 when Cornelia apparently died. Two years later, her pew was transferred to their daughter, Alida. 

<p>For the second half of the eighteenth century, substantial qualitative information exists for "Isaac Fonda" and could refer to any or all of the four Isaacs identified herein. Unless specifically noted, we have tried <a href="../../res/guess.html">not</a> to assign any of those bits to this biographical sketch. Thus, this offering has little depth - only demographics.

<p>However, in October <a href="http://www.threerivershms.com/docnyhistservicemilitiaalb1.htm">1779</a>, Isaac I. Fonda was appointed ensign in the city militia company commanded by Capt. <a href="../d/isdef4726.html">Isaac De Foreest</a>- brother of his late wife. Afterwards, "Isaac Jr." received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3784">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>Albany native Isaac I. Fonda is said to have died in 1784.</p>
