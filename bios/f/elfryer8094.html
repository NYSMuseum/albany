<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Fryer</strong></a> was born in February 1758. She was the daughter of <a href="wmfryer8035.html">William</a> and <a href="../f/hafarrell8022.html">Hannah Farrell</a> Lansing. She grew up as part of a small family in a baker's home in the first ward.

<p>In February 1776, she married Albany native <a href="../l/jolansing3754.html">John A. Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1791, nine children had been christened at the church where she was a member and pewholder.

<p>Elizabeth's new husband served the American <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">cause</a> first as a carpenter and then on the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">supply side</a> as a regimental quartermaster. 

<p>These Lansings also raised their family in a home that became <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA75&lpg=PA75&dq=%22john+a%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22john%20a%22&f=false">33 South Pearl Street</a> probably where John also pursued the baker's craft. Although William Fryer had died in 1768, Elizabeth's growing family lived near several Fryer family kin. While the Lansings were Albany's most numerous residents, by the early 1770s, John's father had left Albany to establish a "New City" named <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#3754">1800</a> and afterwards, this Lansing household was <a href="../l/jolansing3754.html#config">configured</a> on the census of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>Patriot baker John A. Lansing died in 1825. Probated in 1828, his <a href="https://familysearch.org/photos/stories/2665932">will</a> left Elizabeth in charge of his estate during her lifetime.  She lived on in their home at 33 South Pearl Street into the 1830s. In 1836, she applied for a <a href="../l/jolansing3754.html#pension">pension</a> based on Lansing's wartime service. 

<p>Widow Elizabeth Fryer Lansing <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=elizabeth+widow+of+john+lansing&source=bl&ots=sviWbD89Xm&sig=2w4kz1b08pVHxeRfzWWiHrbg-is&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VSnrVMvRN9G1sASy1YGoCA&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=elizabeth%20widow%20of%20john%20lansing&f=false">died</a> in April 1837 at the age of eighty.</p>
