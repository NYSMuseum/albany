<strong>Isaac D. Fonda</strong></a> was born in January 1728. He was the son of Douw and Aaltje Onderdonck Fonda. Although another same-named but much older <a href="isfonda3760.html">Isaac D. Fonda</a> was still alive while this individual was in his childhood, as he matured, this person was known widely as "Isaac D. Fonda."

<p>About 1752, he married <a href="../d/sudf4745.html">Susanna De Foreest</a>. By 1770, their eight children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#29">1756</a>, his name first appeared on the census of city householders. He was identified as a carpenter. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> listed his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> property as of moderate value. In 1760, he had purchased a lot in the first ward. His house was on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl</a> Street. These Fondas were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#3783">mainstays</a> for many decades. Later, he was involved in real property transactions in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> with his son, <a href="jofondajr.html">John Fonda, Jr.</a>

<p>In 1757, he served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the second ward. He was paid by the city on several occasions for carpentry work and for making ladders. He also served in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In 1776, he was identified with the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties when he was elected to represent the second ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. He was an active member throughout its lifetime. Later he served as one of the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies. After the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war</a>, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>With the restoration of the city government in 1778, he was elected assistant <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> for the second ward. He served for more than a decade. During that time, he also held the position of Albany dockmaster.  


<p>Isaac D. Fonda lost his wife of more than forty years in 1798. The following year, the seventy-year-old widower married Martha Cooper at the Albany church. He probably <a href="#dead">died</a> shortly thereafter. </p>

The life of Isaac D. <a href="fonda.html">Fonda</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 3783. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from

<p><a name=dead>But was he the same "Isaac D. Fonda" who died in 1824 and was buried in <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/saratoga1/cem/yellowpics.htm">Saratoga</a>? The stone says the deceased was eighty-something, but . . ." An Isaac D. Fonda owned a number of parcels of land in greater Albany County during his lifespan. At this point, we do not know how many individuals of that name were alive at the time(s).
