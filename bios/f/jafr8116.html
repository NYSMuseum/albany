<strong>Jacob Freligh</strong></a> was born about 1740. His name has been found with a variety of <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>ellings. He probably was of German ancestry.

<p>He married Christina Metsger in August 1762. Their children were not found among the baptism records of <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>. In 1766, he was one of those granted land on the "<a href="../../loc/wout.html">Woutsbergh</a>" to erect a German Reformed Church.

<p>In 1766, Jacob "Fralick" was one of those who <a href="../../solconst.html#8116">signed</a> the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. At that <a href="../../sources.html#uny">time</a>, he was a resident of the west <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manor</a> and a Van Rensselaer tenant. Another notation on those documents noted the property of "Freylay the currier" that was located near the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">So</a>uth Albany <a href="../vs/hvschaack.html">home</a> of Henry Van Schaack.

<p>In 1769, he applied for and recieved a lot on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> for use as a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tan</a> yard. It was located west of Jacob Ten Eyck's lot and was fifty feet on the north and south. The annual quit rent was fixed at ten shillings. In 1787, his rent was in arrears and the lot was to be sold.

<p>In <a href="../../cddc.html">1781</a>, he was identified as a "labourer," denounced as "disaffected," and confined. Later he posted a bond and was released on promise of good behavior. His name also appeared on a number of militia rosters during the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">War</a> and on subsequent bounty rolls.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of a Jacob  Freligh was listed on the census in Clinton, Dutchess County.

<p>We seek information on his later life and passing.</p>
