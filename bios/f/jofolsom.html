<P>Known under various <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>ellings, <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Folsom</strong></a> was an Albany resident during the 1780s.

<p>According to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x-dCdmnX6FcC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22john+folsom%22+silversmith&source=bl&ots=aKWrdQFEfA&sig=P-T7Km6d1TIPTOGNqYhhcWRkXTA&hl=en&ei=em16TJrSOYL7lwftk6C0Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&sqi=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false">family-based</a> sources, he was born in May 1756. He was the youngest son in the large family of Samuel and Ann Bingham Folsom of Stratford, Connecticut. His father was a farmer and blacksmith who is said to have died in Ohio in 1800.

<p>John is said to have left home at age fourteen and to have learned the silversmith's trade.

<p>Coming of age at the outbreak of hostilities, we seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. However, afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8068">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia regiment</a>.

<p>In July 1781, he married "Elizabeth File" (<a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/r/u/Tanya-M-Bruce/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0387.html">Feile?</a>) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Children were christened there in 1782 and '85. However, he was a member and deacon at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a> where his daughters were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3RXxAh_sHaAC&pg=PA505&lpg=PA505&dq=%22elizabeth+file%22+folsom&source=bl&ots=cRopJPfI1n&sig=8nmMM2gAdQa-wZlReCduzrN33GI&hl=en&ei=rHt6TLPsNIWKlweD2YGvCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&sqi=2&ved=0CDEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22elizabeth%20file%22%20folsom&f=false">christened</a> in 1787 and 1789. The marriage is said ultimately to have produced thirteen children. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#8068">1781</a>, he was living in Albany and was among those non natives who purchased the freedom of the city. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a>. Later, he would be called a merchant.


<p>In November 1786, he was appointed chimney viewer for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8068">1788</a>, his house and belongings were valued on the city assessment rolls. It also appears that future Albany silversmith <a href="../h/ishutton.html">Isaac Hutton</a> lived there as well. Folsom's personal property at the third ward <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jofoshop">shop</a> he shared with sailmaker <a href="../e/abeights7800.html">Abraham Eights</a> was also assessed. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jobu">1790</a>, a John Bulson was listed on the Albany census in the second ward. At the same time "John Fulsom" was identified as the head of a household in Argyle, Washington County.

<p>In February 1797, Albany Presbyterian records noted that John Folsom had "removed from the city." 

<p>According to the standard family <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x-dCdmnX6FcC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22john+folsom%22+silversmith&source=bl&ots=aKWrdQFEfA&sig=P-T7Km6d1TIPTOGNqYhhcWRkXTA&hl=en&ei=em16TJrSOYL7lwftk6C0Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&sqi=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false">genealogy</a>, John Folsom left Albany after experiencing business troubles and stopped in what became Greenwich, Washington County. In 1806, he then settled in Glens Falls where he had a farm and lumbering business. He was a devout christian,  a preacher in the Glens Falls Presbyterian Church, and he would be known as "Rev. John Folsom."
 
<p>John Folsom died in August 1838 at the age of eighty-three. His widow survived until 1840.</p>
