<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Fryer</b></a> was the wife of <a href="isfryer8033.html">Isaac Fryer</a> and matriarch of the Albany <a href="fryer.html">Fryer family</a>.</p>


<p>Isaac Fryer had taken up residence on the <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> of Albany about 1720. In 1722, the first of her six children were baptized in the Albany Dutch church.</p>

<p>As her family grew, she found time to help her husband in the practice of the weaver's craft in the Pearl Street home. Isaac Fryer died in 1755. His will filed two years earlier named her co-executor and chief beneficiary during her widowhood. In 1756, her household was enumerated on the citywide <a href="../../census1756.html#176">census of houses</a> and she was identified as a <a href="../../trades/weaver.html">weaver</a>.</p>

<p>Past sixty, she was identified as the head of her first ward household on city assessment rolls for 1766 and 1767. By that time, her daughter, <a href="cafryer8036.html">Catherine</a>, was named in the assessment as well. By 1779, Elizabeth Fryer had passed as Catherine was living in her parents' home as specified in the will of her father.</p>
