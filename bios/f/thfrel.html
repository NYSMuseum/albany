<strong>Theodorus Frelinghuysen, Jr.</strong></a> (sometimes "Frielinghuysen") perhaps was born in 1724. <a href="../../res/sp.html">He</a> was the eldest son of the reknowned Domine <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodorus_Jacobus_Frelinghuysen">Theodorus Frelinghuysen</a> and his wife, Flatbush native Eva Terhune. Their large family grew up at the elder Frelinghuysen's parishes in New Jersey. Four younger brothers became Reformed ministers and two sisters married ministers as well.</P>

<p>Theodorus Jr. (or "Theodorus II") studied at the University of Utrecht and was ordained a minister in October 1745. His first assignment was to the Reformed <a href="../../drc.html">church in Albany</a>.  He quickly set sail for America but his ship was captured by the French and he did not reach his new congregation until the following Spring.

<p>He made an immediate and <a href="../../art/grant4.html#tf">profound impact</a> on his new congregation and was a pillar of the Albany community for more than a decade.

<p><p>His long <a href="../../census1756.html#274">tenure</a> in Albany came at a <a href="../../7yw.html">pivotal time</a> in early American history and in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Awakening">transformation</a> of religion in American life. He his ability to also preach in English  permitted his Albany church to accommodate non Dutch <a href="../../newcomers.html">speakers</a> as well.  However, liturgial matters kept his ministry in <a href="#turmoil">turmoil</a> for most of his tenure.

<p>In January 1756, he married nineteen-year-old <a href="../s/elsymes.html">Elizabeth Symes</a> / Sims - the sister of the wife of eminent Anglican <a  href="../o/jogilvie.html">John Ogilvie</a>. The marriage produced two daughters.

<P>In 1759, Theodorus Frelinghuysen, Jr. sought to return to Holland - presumably for a visit. He sailed from New York in October 1759. Several <a href="../../art/grant4.html#301">senarios</a> have been <a href="#turmoil">offered</a> but he never returned and his fate still has not been definitively determined. His <a href="../w/ewesterlo.html">replacement</a> arrived in Albany in October 1760.</p>
