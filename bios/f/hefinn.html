<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Henry Finn</strong></a> was in Albany for a time during the early 1780s. Beginning with his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>,at this point many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> remain unanswered regarding his life.

<p>In February 1780, he was the sole witness to the baptism of the son of  Albany <a href="../../na/na.html">area</a> resident Jonathan Pettit at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#hf">1781</a>, he was among the thirty-one <a href="../../newcomers.html">new</a>comers who purchased the "freedom" or right to do business in the city of Albany. At that time, he was identified as a merchant.

<p>We seek information on his life during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. His name does not appear on the community-based resources encountered so far. However, the name "Henry Finn" was included on a general <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">list</a> of soldiers serving in the New York Line. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#hf">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>Perhaps he was the Henry Finn whose nine-person household was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> for the Washington County town of Salem in 1790. An <a href="http://boards.ancestry.com/localities.northam.usa.states.newyork.counties.washington/1726.1/mb.ashx">online resource</a> follows the life of this individual to his death about 1815 in central New York

<p>Aside from three references placing Henry Finn in Albany about 1781, his story awaits answers to many presently unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">q</a>uestions. Perhaps he was a relative of the younger New York-born actor <a href="http://www.famousamericans.net/henryjfinn/">Henry J. Finn</a>.</p>
