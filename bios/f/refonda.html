<strong>Rebecca Fonda</strong></a> probably was born during the 1690s. Perhaps she was the daughter of one-time Albany residents <a href="jofonda3766.html">Jan</a> and <a href="../l/maloock5938.html">Maria Loockermans</a> Fonda.  

<p>In September 1718, she married <a href="../b/joblo1480.html">Jan Maase Bloomendal</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1728, six children had been christened in Albany.

<p>This Maase family was an Albany mainstay. They lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in  the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Jan Maase was known as a <a href="../../census1756.html#296">brazier</a> and minor officeholder. He served as firemaster as early as <a href="../../org/cc.html#1714">1714</a>.

<p>Rebecca Fonda Maase (Bloomendal) may have died after the birth of her last child. However, she may have survived into the 1760s. </p>
