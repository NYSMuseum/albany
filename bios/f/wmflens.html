<P>The name of "<a href="#sources">
<strong>William Flansbury</strong></a>" was included on a <a href="../../census1756.html#207">census</a> of Albany householders made by the British army in 1756. He was called a carpenter and his Albany house was said to have been able to accommodate no officers but 4-6 soldiers. It had two fireplaces and one room without fire, and the family currently occupied one room. This profile seeks to identify and place that individual on the community landscape.

<p>That householder cannot be the boy <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part3.html">christened</a> in the Flensburgh family on September 28, 1746 - unless he was baptized at age 10 or so. At this point, we cannot say that this "real person" is a member of the Albany <a href="flens.html">Flensburgh</a> family.

<p>A number of marriage senarios are possible as well.

<p>In November 1774, the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq#v=onepage&q=+flansburg&f=false">city council</a> paid the account of William Flansburg the sum of one pound, twelve shillings.

<p>Military service records exist for William F___s during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">R</a>evolutionary era.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#wmfl">1790</a>, the household of William Flansburgh was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet - probably located south of the city in what soon would become <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">B</a>ethlehem.

<p>In March 1821, William Flansburg of Berne filed a <a href="http://www.footprints.org/8-100105.htm">will</a>. It identified heirs including a son named Matthew. Those children fit with the WF who married Christina Boeckes and fathered a number of children up to 1782.

<p>At this point, we cannot definitively connect the individual listed with the Albany householders to any of other "<a href="../../res/sp.html">William</a>s" named above. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on the origins of the Albany mainstay of 1756.</p>
