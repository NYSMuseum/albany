<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Fryer </strong></a> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in March 1766. He was the son of Johannes and Catharina "Kennryk" Fryer. Perhaps these parents were <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> Albany residents - although most contemporary Fryers lived in or near Albany. We will refer to him as "John J. Fryer" to curtail confusion with his father and <a href="jofryer8136.html">other</a> "John Fry<a href="../../res/sp.html">e</a>rs" <a href="jofryer8135.html">living</a> in the Albany area.

<p>His wife was <a href="#ch">Christina</a>. The marriage produced children. Although not yet definitively documented, we expect that these Fryers would be connected to <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jofr">1788</a> and 1799, city assessment rolls for the first ward valued the property of a John J. Fryer.
<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#jofr">1800</a>, two <a href="../../census1800.html#jofr2">separate</a> first ward households were configured for "John Fryar."

<p>Additional qualitative information is available for John Fryer. However, so many individuals are <a href="../qqqq.html">at risk</a> here that further study is required to move forward. 

<p>Albany resident John J. Fryer <a href="https://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/284/mode/2up">died</a> in December 1815 and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Episcopal plot. He had lived just forty-nine years. Within a few years, two of their children were interred there as well. His widow probably lived on for a number of years.</p>
