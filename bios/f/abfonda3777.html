<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham I. Fonda </strong></a> was born in August 1718. He was the eldest surviving son of <a href="isfonda3760.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../l/allansing3100.html">Alida Lansing</a> Fonda. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of a middling merchant along with brothers and sisters who also would become Albany residents. He was referred to as "Abraham I. Fonda" to help prevent confusion with a number of contemporary Abraham Fondas living in the Albany area.

<p>In September 1743, Abraham I. married <a href="../vs/mavschoon5902.html">Maria Van Schoonhoven</a> of <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">H</a>alfmoon at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1759, seven children had been christened in Albany.

<p>Abraham I. Fonda was identified as a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> on a census of Albany householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html#258">1756</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1740">1740</a>, he had been appointed constable for the third ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1747">1747</a> and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>, he served as firemaster.

<p>Beginning during the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s,</a> his house and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> were valued moderately. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3777">1779</a>, his holdings were assessed for the last time. His blacksmith son <a href="jafonda3787.html">Jacobus</a>, and son <a href="isfonda3786.html">Isaac A. Fonda</a>, a bachelor, lived in Abraham's house during those years.

<p>In his late sixties in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, Abraham I. would have been too old for active service. However, the records of the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany</a> committee  reference a large number of entries for <a href="../../res/sp.html">sim</a>ply "Abraham Fonda."  

<p>In <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html#3777">1788</a>, his name appeared on the estate ledger of an Albany neighbor. At that time, he would have been about seventy-years-old. After that, his name has not been found in the community-based record. His widow is <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/p/e/n/Danielle-A-Pensec-CA/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0386.html">said</a> to have died in 1801.

<p>We seek information on the <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a> of Albany resident Abraham I. Fonda.</p>
