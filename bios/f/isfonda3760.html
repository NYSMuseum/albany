<strong>Isaac D. Fonda</strong></a> was born in March 1684. He was the son of <a href="dofonda3763.html">Douwe</a> and <a href="../c/reconyn3765.html">Rebecca Conyn</a> Fonda. He was a younger son in a large family and grew up in a home beyond Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north gate</a>. Isaac's father died in 1700 when the boy was sixteen.

<p>In December 1708, he married fur trader's daughter <a href="../l/allansing3100.html">Alida Lansing</a> at the  Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1723, the marriage had produced eight children who were christened at the Albany church where both parents were frequent baptism sponsors. Seven of those children lived to marry and raise their own families - further solidifying the family web.
 
<p>Fonda was a businessman who set up his home in Albany where his holdings were assessed as early as <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3760">1709</a>. He belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a> and was included on freeholder's lists in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3760">1720</a>. 

<p>He  <a href="../../org/cc.html#1716">served</a> the community first as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> (1716-18), and as assistant then alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> (1732-34).


<p>Isaac D. Fonda is said to have died in 1748. If so, he lived for sixty-four years. <a href="isfonda3783.html">Another</a> "Isaac D. Fonda" was born to Albany parents in 1728.</p>
