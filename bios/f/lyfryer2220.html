      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Lydia Fryer</b></a> was born in October 1753. She 
        was baptized at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican 
        church where her parents, <a href="jofryer8034.html">John</a> and <a href="../vz/anvzandt239.html">Hannah 
        Van Zandt</a> Fryer, were members.</p>
      <p>This sloop captain's daughter grew up in Albany's first ward surrounded 
        by her mother's family - the <a href="../vz/vzandt.html">Van Zandts</a>. </p>
      <p>She married rising attorney <a href="../v/mavisscher4062.html">Matthew 
        Visscher</a> in 1772. Over the next decade, their children were baptized 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was 
        a member and pewholder. Over the next two decades, Matthew Visscher emerged 
        as one of the visible leaders of the new city.</p>
<p>In November 1783, she was identified as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjofryer.html">will</a> filed by her father.
		
		
      <p><a href="#house"><img src="../../images/jpg/mvisscherhse.jpg" align=right border=1 v space=4 h width=150" alt="Matthew Visscher House about 1830"></a>After 
        living with her family on the Southside, by <a href="../../census1790.html#4062">1790</a> 
        these Visschers had moved into their new home on Pearl Street in a style 
        befitting a rising public official.</p>
      <p>However, Lydia was on her own when Matthew Visscher died suddenly in 
        August 1793. The young widow became head of their <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a> home that became 100 North Pearl Street. This premier <a href="../../im/imepearl.html">residential 
        location</a> would become known as a "street of widows!" 
      <p>A few months later, a <a href="../../fire.html">great fire</a> destroyed 
        a large chunk of the old city - coming precariously close to the new Visscher 
        home. To make matters worse, the fire was blamed on <a href="../slave/pomp.html">Pomp</a> 
        - the servant of Matthew Visscher who had been out-of-control since the 
        death of his master.</p>
      <p>Although not yet forty-years-old, widow Lydia Visscher did not remarry. 
        Taking control of her husband's estate, she would count on the support 
        of her son, <a href="../v/sebvisscher.html">Sebastian (Bastian)</a>, who 
        helped her sell off extra property. Living with other widows, servants 
        helped her maintain the Pearl Street home for many years.</p>
      <p>Lydia Fryer Visscher died in April 1841 at the age of eighty-eight. Her 
        will passed probate in July.</p>

      <p><a name=house></a>Watercolor titled "<b>Matthew Visscher House</b> - 
        1830." Probably derived from a <a href="../../im/imepearl.html">cityscape 
        painting</a> by James Eights. This image was copied from a forgotten/unknown/un-attributed 
        Internet source – perhaps in the course of cyber-shopping! Copy in the 
        CAP <a href="../../grapharch.html">Graphics Archives</a>. In 1788, only 
        <a href="../b/jorbleecker201.html">one home</a> in the second ward was 
        assessed higher than Matthew Visscher's new house. Widow Lydia Visscher 
        probably lived at this 100 North Pearl Street address until her death 
        - almost fifty years after her husband!</p>
