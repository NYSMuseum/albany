<strong>Francis Follet</strong></a> was born in March 1768. He was the first-born son of <a href="chfoll8065.html">Charles</a> and <a href="../b/mabgd4834.html">Mary Bloodgood</a> Folliot/Follet. He grew up with only one brother in a merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#mark">Mark Lane</a> near the Albany waterfront where "Bloodgood & Follet" kept a store at least into the early 1790s. Francis was named for his mother's father - the Bloodgood family patriarch.

<p>During the 1780s and early 1790s, he witnessed the filing of administrative papers on behalf of a number of residents from around greater Albany County. This probably meant that he had a connection to the Albany courthouse and to courthouses in <a href="../../inprog.html">elsewhere</a> in New York State.

<p>He was the 287th person to sign in at the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> lodge - probably after the war.

<p>In 1792, <a href="chfoll8065.html">Charles Folliot</a> granted a power of attorney to his son, Francis.  Perhaps, that was because the elder Follet had relocated to eastern New York (Schaghticoke).

<p>In March 1795, Francis Folliot had commissioned a miniature from <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra Ames</a>.

<p>In June 1797, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yehmAAAAMAAJ&q=francis+follet&dq=francis+follet&lr=&pgis=1">married</a> Jane Watson in New York City. 
 

<p>In January 1797, he was among the petitioners for the incorporation of an Albany library. In May, letters of administration on the estate of deceased merchant <a href="../w/mawatson6837.html">Matthew Watson</a> were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dhAXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA251&dq=francis+follet">granted</a> to his son William and to "Francis Follet," a friend. Later that year, he was identified as a merchant and as a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">freeholder</a> living in the first ward. 

<p>In March 1799, Follet and his wife <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Xc81AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA14&dq=francis+follet&lr=#PPA15,M1">sold land</a> in Onondaga County to Saratoga County farmer Robert Mc Knight. A few years earlier, he was involved in a <a href="http://miasp.milliman.com/SaciaTree/webdocs/deeds1700.htm">real estate transaction</a> involving property in New York City. 
 
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, store, and lots in the first ward were valued substantially on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#frfo">1800</a>, his first ward home was configured on the census with a boy under ten, a man 26-45, two women of that age, another free person, and a slave as members of his household. 

<p>After that,  the name of Francis Follet dropped from city rolls.

The life of Francis Follet is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 8066. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. At least two relatively prominent, same-named individuals lived during his lifetime in New Hampshire and Virginia. Additionally, in 1790 the household of a "Francis Follet" was included on the census for Orange County, Vermont. <p></p>
