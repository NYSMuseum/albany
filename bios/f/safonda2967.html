        <a href="#sources"><strong>Sara Fondey</strong></a> was born in June 1784. 
        She was the first child born to the marriage of <a href="jofondajr.html">John 
        Fondey Jr.</a> and his wife <a href="../h/cohun4795.html">Cornelia Hun</a> 
        Fonda. The young beauty was captured in a <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/Painting/ames.htm">family 
        portrait</a> done in 1803 when she was nineteen. 
      <p>By the mid-1800s, she had married her childhood neighbor the somewhat older <a href="../w/jewinne2790.html">Jellis Winne, Jr.</a> The marriage produced several children. Their eldest <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YdMLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=%22sara+fondey%22&source=bl&ots=mNfxY5W6K4&sig=bky-FSD9Sm3CHbypl_eQaonshGo&hl=en&ei=lNAzS_eOKJOxlAfj_4GWBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22sara%20fondey%22&f=false">son</a> became a prominent physician. We seek information on her married life and family.

<p>These Winnes lived on <a href="../../streets.html#market">North Market Street</a> almost across the street from her childhood home. Her husband was a business associate of her father until John Fondey's death in 1814. Jellis Fonda enjoyed success in business and banking. They were pillars of the early nineteenth century <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> community. 

<p>Sara's father's death in 1814 left "Sally" a share of his <a href="../../wills/willjofondajr.html">estate</a> of which her husband was co-executor and which still generated family <a href="http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.fondey/1/mb.ashx">income</a> into the late 1820s. 

<p>Sara Fondey Winne died in November 1834. She had lived fifty years. Her husband survived until 1849.
