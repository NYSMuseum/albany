<strong>Charles Folliet</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> Follet, Vollet)  probably was born during the 1740s. He may have been the son of Charles Follet of <a href="http://www.doak.ws/sources.htm">Boston</a> or the kinsman of George Folliet, later a Queens County loyalist.

<p>By the mid-1760s, he had settled in Albany. Beginning in <ahref="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his second ward home was accorded a modest assessment on Albany tax lists. In 1768, he purchased a lot on <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius Street</a>. Four years later, he owed for the lot and was expected to leave Albany. By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, assessment rolls listed that property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He was known as a <a href="../../makers.html">carpenter</a>. 

<p>His wife was <a href="../b/mabgd4834.html">Mary Bloodgood</a>. Two children were born between 1768 and 1779 and christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>In May 1775, he made a modest contribution for the relief of Ticonderoga. However, by the next year, he was in trouble with the Albany revolutionaries. In June, he was among those <a href="../../or/or-be.html">arrested</a> following an evening of drinking to the King's health. Incarcerated, he refused to sign the <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">Association</a>, he was freed in July after posting a bond promising good behavior. However, after the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service in <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8065">conjunction</a> with the Albany militia regiment.  
 


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, a Charles Folliot was identified as a resident of <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 


<p>In August 1791, his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> lot was mentioned in a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transaction. Charles Folli<a href="../../res/sp.html">e</a>t died sometime after he granted a power of attorney to his son, <a href="frfoll.html">Francis</a>, in March 1792. Charles Follet was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/cemf5.txt">buried</a> in Schaghticoke in May 1818 at the age of seventy-nine.
