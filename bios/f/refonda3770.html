<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Rebecca Fonda</strong></a> was born in March 1686. She was the daughter of <a href="dofonda3763.html">Douw Jellis</a> and <a href="../c/reconyn3765.html">Rebecca Conyn</a> Fonda. She grew up in a large family in a home just outside the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North gate</a> but lost her father about 1700 when she was in her teens. However, her mother lived until 1727.

<p>About 1710, she married the slightly younger Albany native <a href="../b/pibogert6070.html">Pieter Bogert</a>. By 1726, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> although their marriage was not entered in the church records. 

<p>These Bogerts lived modestly in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Pieter was involved in a number of civic activities.
 
<p>"Rebecca Fonda," the wife of Pieter Bogert, was buried by the church in February 1754. She had lived about sixty-eight years. He survived for at least another decade.</p>
