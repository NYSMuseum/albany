<strong>Elizabeth Fonda</strong></a> was born in 1711 and <a href="http://www.altlaw.com/edball/dutchbap.htm#1711">bap</a>tized at the Dutch church in New York in July. She was the daughter of <a href="isfonda3760.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../l/allansing3100.html">Alida Lansing</a> Fonda. She grew up in a large family in the second ward home of an Albany mainstay.

<p>In January 1735, she married <a href="../k/woknick1530.html">Wouter Knickerbacker</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, eight children had been christened at the Albany church where she was a pewholder and frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>This Knickerbacker family lived in or north of Albany near Elizabeth's kin. Wouter was an Albany property holder who was <a href="../../census1756.html#134">identified</a> as a farmer.

<p>Elizabeth Fonda Knickerbacker died in December 1760 and was buried from the church. She had not reached her fiftieth birthday. Her husband does not appear to have remarried but survived for several decades.
