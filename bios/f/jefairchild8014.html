<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jesse Fairchild</strong></a> was born about 1740 in New Jersey. <a href="http://boards.ancestry.com.au/surnames.fairchild/186.435/mb.ashx">Perhaps</a> he was the same-named individual who was a blacksmith in Morris County in 1763.

<p>In September 1771, <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> church records identified him as a blacksmith and stated that <a href="../w/jowillis.html">John Willis</a> was his journeyman. In November of that year the new <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> advertized that he was a <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith</a> and that he had relocated to Albany from New Jersey. In December, he advertized that he was looking for an apprentice smith.


<p>By the mid-1770s, he had married Albany native Maria <a href="../g/gerritse.html">G</a>erritsen. Between 1775 and 1779, four children had been christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany.

<p>In October 1776, he was one of the smiths employed in making spades, nails, and later handcuffs for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a>. In 1778, he <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html">served</a> under the Continental Quartermaster General's command and had charge of six nailers. During the war, a Jesse Fairchild (probably not this blacksmith) was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#military">listed</a> as an enlisted man on the rosters of the first and third regiments of the New York Line and on a subsequent land bounty list.
 
<p>In 1779, his <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8014">res</a>idence, <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8014s">shop</a>, and <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8014l">lot</a> were valued separately on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll.
	  
<p>In November 1780, he was identified as an Albany blacksmith when he posted a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5vm7k0yfMesC&pg=PA570&lpg=PA570&dq=%22jesse+fairchild%22+albany&source=bl&ots=uIHbgoBi9E&sig=yXlm1oT11B4UhAxpkQ1ip9JFgOU&hl=en&ei=scObS46RMIT78AbNrMmxDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CA4Q6AEwBA#">bond</a> for good behavior with the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>.
 
<p>In July 1785, the city records <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq#v=onepage&q&f=true">noted</a> that he was in business with Vosburgh and noted that he was paid from the city treasury.

<p>The name of Jesse Fairchild has not been found in the community-based Albany record after 1785 nor was he on the census in New York State in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. But, was he the "Jesse Fairchild, Esq." who officiated the marriage of Colin Gibson and Peggy Miller in Cambridge in October 1807? Family-based resources <a href="http://www.familyorigins.com/users/k/a/t/Roy--Katschke/FAMO5-0001/d35.htm#P7457">hold</a> that Jesse Fairchild died on February 13, 1813 in Colonie. </p>
