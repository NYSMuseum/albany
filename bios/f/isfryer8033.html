<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac Fryer</b></a> probably was born in England about 1690. He came to America during the early 1700s. Perhaps he was the Isaac Fryer identified as an enlisted man in an "Independent Company of fuzileers" stationed at Catskill under the command of Colonel Peter Matthews in 1714<a href="#company">!</a></p>

<p>In 1720, he purchased land at the foot of <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> from the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>.

<p> Beginning in 1722, five children of Isaac and <a href="elizfryer1859.html">Elizabeth</a> Fryer were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html"> Dutch church</a>. Known as "English people," they received additional services at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>He probably built his house near the corner of today's <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl</a> and Hudson Streets. He lived among a small enclave of <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> weavers. His will noted a "weaver's loom." He served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the first ward and purchased additional lots near his home. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, he was listed with the qualified freeholders in the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a>. 


<p>Isaac Fryer filed a <a href="../../wills/willisfryer.html">will</a> in December 1753. Calling himself a <a href="../../trades/weaver.html">weaver</a>, it named his wife and four children and listed his house and lot in the first ward, his loom, and other personal property. He died in August 1755 and was buried in the English church cemetery.</p>
