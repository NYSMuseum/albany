        Fonda, Jr.</b></a> was born in 1761. He was the son of Albany residents 
        <a href="isfonda3783.html">Isaac D.</a> and <a href="../d/sudf4745.html">Susanna De Foreest</a> Fonda. He also was known as "Fondey" and as "John I. Fonda." </p>


<p>While still in his teens, he joined the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties. He was an ensign in an Albany Ranger company and also a quartermaster and lieutenant in Colonel Marinus Willet's regiment of the New York troops. He saw <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">active duty</a> on the New York frontier. Surviving records refer to his his militia unit as "Fondey's party!"</p>

<p>In 1779, his name first appreared on a city assessment roll. In 1780, he began to take his place in Albany society when he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the second ward. With the end of the war, he entered business (selling imported glass and ceramics) and began to acquire real estate along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. His extensive real estate dealings in Albany and <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> are <a href="http://www.schist.org/DeedFile.htm">chronicled online</a>!</p>

<p>In 1783, he married <a href="../h/cohun4795.html">Cornelia Hun</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3788">settled</a> into her father's home on North Market Street at the corner of <a href="../../streets.html#tromp">Van Tromp</a>. Their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4784">1790</a>, his growing family was counted within the household of his father-in-law. By <a href="../../census1800.html#3788">1800</a>, he had taken over as the head of the third ward household that now included a dozen members. In 1803, his family was memorialized in a 
<a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/Painting/ames.htm">beautiful portrait</a> by Albany artist Ezra Ames.</p>

<p>Over the next decade, Fonda/Fondey brought his sons and son-in-law into his business and sought to develop his waterfront holdings. The landmark home and grounds were <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> fixtures. </p>

<p>John Fonda, Jr. filed a <a href="../../wills/willjofondajr.html">will</a> in January 1814. He was dead by August 2 when the passed probate. His widow and sons lived on in their Market Street home.</p>
