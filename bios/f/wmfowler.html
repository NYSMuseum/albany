<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Fowler</strong></a> was born about 1774. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=goRAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=%22william+fowler%22+albany&source=bl&ots=Wn_8SZP9xe&sig=MTm1mRLuvx59L2EjoPaMYJE4mAc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cl62T93zIfCA6QHZv7nzCg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=%22william%20fowler%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have been born in February in Eastchester, Westchester County, New York.

<p>Thus, he would have worked in the manufacture of morocco (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_leather">generally</a>, fine leather tanned with sumac) in New York City. He is said to have come to Albany in 1793 but lost his resources in a <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> during the 1790s. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=goRAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=astor+%22william+fowler%22&source=bl&ots=Wn_8V1T8xc&sig=KJnrP2Ld6ilJ_Rg354YyWKQq-C0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=y527T-7_N6Xw6AH86uDCCg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=astor%20%22william%20fowler%22&f=false">said</a> to have be re-capitalized by John Jacob Astor and to have been in the wool and fur business with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Knower">Benjamin Knower</a> for many years. Again, according to the most <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional of <a href="../../fhg.html#nea">sources</a>, he prospered and was able to retire in 1824.  

<p>He is <a href="http://www.gregorygenealogy.com/Henry-0/gp2323.html">said</a> to have married <a href="../s/mgtstevenson.html">Margaret Stevenson</a> in 1796. Their son, "Samuel Stevenson Fowler," was christened in Albany in 1799. Another <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BqdVAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA23&lpg=RA3-PA23&dq=%22margaret+stevenson%22+fowler+albany&source=bl&ots=Ne3pt3YzA8&sig=IWtuR_iZ95fdZQu0XeLUcBl1JZY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Tri7T7_EEcmZ6QH5g83NCw&sqi=2&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22margaret%20stevenson%22%20fowler%20albany&f=false">son</a> became a prominent cleric. In August 1818, their daughter became the first wife of jurist <a href="../f/safoote.html">Samuel A. Foote</a>. Another son (William) died in 1823. These Fowlers were members of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>In  <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot were accorded modest assessments. In that year, the newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WqApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA310&lpg=PA310&dq=%22william+fowler+informed%22&source=bl&ots=3ZxDhVXoDS&sig=kFwJx4nn8SLwRw1N6JHLrdWMTdU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oW-2T9rdDMrJ6gG3jeXCCg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20fowler%20informed%22&f=false">advertized</a> that "William Fowler informed his friends and the public that he had for sale at his shop, No. 9 Court street, the following articles, viz: Leather Breeches, warranted to be good; buck and sheep skins, dressed; gloves, mittens, mocasins; and every other article in his line, either ready made or furnished on the shortest notice, on reasonable terms. A consignment of 400 Racoon skins; a variety of Paper Hangings kept constantly on hand at the New York prices." This merchant also was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">known</a> as a "skinner" <a href="../../trades/leather.html">and</a> "glover." 

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#2598">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> household included six members. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">censuses</a> detailed the changing demographics of his family.

<p>During the 1800s, these Fowlers bought and sold a number of parcels of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> - mostly in the first ward.


<p>During the early 1800s, he was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a> and of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#wf">Masonic Lodge</a>.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=%22fowler+william%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22fowler%20william%22&f=false">1813</a>, city directories identified him as a merchant at 33 <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court</a> (later 409 South Market) Street. He also was listed as the owner of a "moro factory" on/at <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">Ferry</a> Street.

<p>In 1811, he was elected one of the first directors of the Mechanics & Farmers Bank and served for a number of years.

<p>Over the remainder of his long life, Fowler was a director and trustee of a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA686&lpg=PA686&dq=%22william+fowler%22+albany&source=bl&ots=m1c0RBbKhZ&sig=brZ4AE6ffz3IIqyPRMlLgOkTmOg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1Wm2T6PnBaXl6QGDwZn8Cg&ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjge#v=onepage&q=%22william%20fowler%22%20albany&f=false">number</a> of Albany-based civic organizations.



<p>Margaret Fowler died in January 1852. She had lived 76 years. On October 1, 1861, the Albany newspaper <a href="../../guide/histres.html#nn">noted</a> that William Fowler had died at the age of eighty-seven. His will was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probated</a> in Albany County.</p>
