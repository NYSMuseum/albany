<P>The name of <a href="#sources">
<strong></strong></a>
<a href="../../res/sp.html">Isabel Fife</a> was listed on the <a href="../../census1790.html#ifife">census of 1790</a> in the uphill section of Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Her household included two boys under sixteen years of age. This women died in Albany and 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on her estate in August 1794.</p>

<p>We believe she was the Isabel Fife who came to America on the ship <i>Glascow Packet</i> in April 1775. She was identified as a twenty-seven-year-old resident of Paisly, Scotland and was accompanied by a child. She was headed for New York and "going to her husband."</p>

<p>Probably not finding her spouse, she finally settled in Albany where her son learned the woodworker's trade and then went to New York. Known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Phyfe">Duncan Phyfe</a>, he became a chairmaker and later one of the most important furniture manufacturers in the new American republic.</p>
 
<p>At administrator Duncan's request, Isabella Phyfe's estate was inventoried following his mother's death. Her possessions included household items,  clothing, and 45 pounds 10 shillings in cash - all totalling 76 pounds 9 shillings and 4 pence! From her effects, perhaps she had supported herself sewing, washing, or performing other domestic chores.</p>

The life of Isabel Fife has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Internet expositions have begun to shed light on her background. <a href="http://www.familyhistorypages.com/Fife.htm">Fife</a>, however, makes no provision for a son named Duncan.</p>
