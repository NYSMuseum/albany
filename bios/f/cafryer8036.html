<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catherine Fryer</b></a> was born about 1731. She was the sole surviving daughter of Albany newcomers <a href="isfryer8033.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="elizfryer1859.html">Elizabeth</a> Fryer.</p>

<p>She grew up and lived most of her life in the family home on <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a>. She apparently did not marry. She was a longtime member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's Anglican</a> Church. She sponsored a number of baptisms there during the 1750s and 60s.</p>

<p>In 1753, she was <a href="../../wills/willisfryer.html">willed</a> a share of Isaac Fryer's estate, left his "great cupboard or kas," and allowed to live in the family home until she married.</p>

<p>Her father died in 1755. By 1767, she was named on city assessment rolls in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house headed by her mother. Over the next two decades, she would be listed on <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8036" title="Link to Albany assessment roll for 1788">tax rolls</a> but it is not clear whether she was living separately or with the family of her brother.</p> 

<p>Catherine Fryer died in October 1791 at age sixty. She was buried from the Albany Dutch church. Letters of administration were issued on her estate to her brother, <a href="isfryer8037.html">Isaac</a>, in August 1792.</p>
