<P>Known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Furnival</strong></a> (Furnwall) lived in Albany during the late 1770s. Perhaps he was the James Furnival who was an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA240&lpg=PA240&dq=%22furnival,+james%22+heitman&source=bl&ots=vjVGFl3uCb&sig=6igim7At4VzMe2vs3zhpwVBiM_A&hl=en&ei=c14OTM2wB4aBlAeV0_1s&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">officer</a> in the Continental artillery from Massachusetts who was sent to General Schuyler in 1777 under guard. He is <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:LzxQFsey-b8J:www.saratogaplan.org/documents/1BattlesofSaratogaPreservationPlanFinalDraft.pdf+%22james+furnival%22+massachusetts&cd=48&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">said</a> to have served at the Battle of Saratoga

<p>Probably during the 1770s, he signed in at the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#jafur">Masonic lodge</a>.

<p>His wife was named Mary. Perhaps their marriage was childless as no children appear to have been christened in early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In August 1778, James and Mary bought <a href="../../res/realestate.html">or</a> leased five or six lots along King Street (<a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a>) from the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> of Albany.
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jafur">1779</a>, his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> was assessed moderately. However, his personal property was accorded a more substantial assessment.

<p>However, by November 1778, Furnival/Furnwall had come under the <a href="../../friends.html">scrutiny</a> of the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies. Identified as an innkeeper, he posted a bond and later was arrested for recruiting soldiers for the British army. He was released on bond and his promise of good behavior.

<p>After 1779, the name of James Furnival has not been found in the community-based record.

<p> <a href="http://www.gaspe-loyalists.ca/Docs/ACNY5.pdf">Perhaps</a> he was among the <a href="../../or/or-icw.html">loyalists</a> who emigrated to Canada! We appreciate that many essential <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> remain surrounding the brief Albany life of this individual.</p>
