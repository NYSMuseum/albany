<strong>Caty Fryer</strong></a> was born during the early 1760s. She probably was a daughter of <a href="wmfryer8035.html">William</a> and <a href="hafarrell8022.html">Hannah Farrell</a> Fryer. However, her christening has not yet been found in the available records of early Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. The Fryers were prominent members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> English church. Her father had passed by 1768 when her widowed mother was referenced in community-based documents. Caty probably was named for her <a href="cafryer8036.html">maiden aunt</a> who eventually became head of the Fryer family homestead located around the corner on <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a>.


<p>In September 1789, she probably was <a href="../../marriages.html#young">older</a> than most first-time brides when she married Albany native <a href="../h/jahilton.html">James/Jacobus Hilton</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1799, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Hiltons made their <a href="../../census1790.html#jah">home</a> near both of their families on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South side</a> of Albany - probably on <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#jah">1800</a>, their home included Caty and her husband, two younger adults, and an adolescent. 
<p>Catherine Fryer Hilton died in November 1807 and was buried from the church. She had lived forty-seven years. Her husband survived for several decades.
