      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>(Nicholas) Claes Fonda</strong></a> was 
        born during the last quarter of the seventeenth century. He was the son 
        of <a href="dofonda3763.html">Douwe</a> and <a href="../c/reconyn3765.html">Rebecca 
        Conyn</a> Fonda. He grew up in a large family in his father's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North 
        Albany</a> home. His name appeared in the records as both "Nicholas" and 
        "Claes." His father died in 1700. 
      <p>In November 1716, he married <a href="../m/anmarselis628.html">Anna Marselis</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1732, six 
        children had been christened in the church where he had been a member 
        since 1692 and was a regular baptism sponsor. 
      <p>Claes Fonda was an Albany mainstay for more than a half century. He was 
        a <a href="../../census1756.html#123">cooper</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3772">freeholder</a>, 
        and a sergeant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1706">1706</a>, he first was 
        appointed as constable. The next year, he was chosen high constable. He 
        also served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and on 
        juries. In 1732, he was paid for making <a href="../../fire.html">fire 
        buckets</a>. 
      <p>He first appeared on Albany rolls in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3772">1699</a> 
        when he pledged allegiance to the king of England. Beginning in 1702, 
        his second ward property was valued on city assessment <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3772">rolls</a>. 
      <p>Claes Fonda lost his wife in 1751. He died in August 1763 and was buried 
        by his son in the church cemetery.</p>
