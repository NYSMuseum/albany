<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Finn</b></a> was listed as the head of a childless Albany household on the city <a href="../../census1697.html#028">census in 1697</a>. Two years later, he joined his Albany neighbors in signing a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html">loyalty oath</a> to the King of England.</p>

<p>He probably was a soldier at the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">Albany fort</a>!</p>

<p>In June 1697, he married Jopje Classe Van Slyck at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where their child was baptized in 1698. He then married Alide Jans Gardinier in 1699. By 1702, two of their children had been baptized at the Albany church.</p>

<p>During that time, he was a juror and litigant before the Albany court. In June <a href="../../doc/cc/0627699.html">1699</a>, he was among those cited for illegal trading as he did not possess the freedom of the city. Subsequently, he did have a trading license!</p>

<p><a href="../../sources.html#pfs">Traditional sources</a> identify him as a cooper and that he was from Waterfort, Ireland. However, the census in 1697 did not identify him as Irish - unlike the <a href="../../census1697.html#026">designation</a> assigned to his neighbor William Hogan.

<p> Otherwise, after signing Albany-based petitions in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1700pe">1700</a> and 1701 and being named in the baptism of a son in 1702, John Finn's name disappeared from the community record. We <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now still seeking defining information on his precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and later life.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of John Finn/Jean Fyne/Fein/Fine/Syne is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6028. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Somewhat conflicting information on his first marriage (which states he was from England) appears in the <a href="http://olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/church/rdcmarr1693.shtml">Manhattan church records</a>.  The name of his first wife is the <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2001-11/1004617693">subject of some discussion</a>. </font size></p>
