<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Fonda</strong></a> was born in September 1769. He was the son of <a href="gysfonda3782.html">Gysbert</a> and <a href="../d/eldouw2080.html">Elsie Douw</a> Fonda. The fourth child in that line to be christened Nicholas (after the paternal <a href="clfonda3772.html">grandfather</a>), he grew up in the predictably small family of a <a href="../../census1756.html#156">prom</a>inent Pearl Street businessman.

<P>The sole surviving son of an established family he was sent to Columbia College from where he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=j1NCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=%22nicholas+fonda%22+columbia&source=bl&ots=Cl64yA7ZNC&sig=3REf_s-4OY8S5QLDJ2gXzCRhlB4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj8jKrBicHOAhUDKB4KHZMlCwkQ6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20fonda%22%20columbia&f=false">graduated</a> in 1787. Four years, later, he was among those aspiring attorneys <a href="http://www.saratoganygenweb.com/Sylvester/chap39.html">admitted</a> to practice law in Rensselaer and Saratoga counties.
		 
<p>In February 1788, he was one of the two surviving children named along with their mother as heirs and executors in the <a href="../../wills/willgyfonda.html">will</a> filed by his father. Gysbert was dead by the end of the year and Elsie took over as <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2080">property owner</a> of record that same year.

<p>His mother would survive to the age of ninety-two. But, in <a href="../../census1790.html#3789">1790</a>, Nicholas was identified as head of a second ward household. That unit included two females and four slaves. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, resources at that <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> address were valued under the name of the "widow of Guysbert Fonda." 

<p>This individual does not seem to have married - although the <a href="../qqqq.html">name</a> "Nicholas Fonda" made a number of appearances in the records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> during the late 1780s and 90s.. He was closely connected to his mother and his older <a href="cafonda3805.html">sister</a> who had married newcomer <a href="../l/rilush1047.html">Richard Lush</a>.

<p>In January <a href="#inc">1797</a>, he was among those signing a petition to incorporate a library in Albany.  

<p>In March 1797, an Albany paper <a href="#inc">reported</a> that "after a tedious illness, Nicolas Fonda, Esq. of this city; [died] and on Thursday, his remains were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=%22nicholas+fonda%22+will&source=bl&ots=SrcpSLzlvg&sig=yjSIGd5CrSE6vykWJfXpIW8VoKY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj_sYj9mMbOAhXOMx4KHerXAtgQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20fonda%22&f=false">interred</a> in the Dutch Church cemetery[.] A very respectable and numerous concourse of relatives and other citizens attended the interment." He had lived but twenty-seven years. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in July 1802 with his mother Elsie as his principal heir.</p>
