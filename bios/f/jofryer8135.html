<strong>John Fryer</strong></a> was born about 1730. We seek information on his parentage and childhood. He <a href="#will">may</a> have been a son of Albany slooper <a href="jofryer8034.html">John Fryer</a>. More certainly, he was  a grandson of Albany patriarch <a href="isfryer8033.html">Isaac Fryer</a>.


<p>In March 1759, he married <a href="../vw/elvwoert2428.html">Elizabeth Van Woert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1777, nine children had been christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. By 1769, these Fryers had become members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. In <a href="../../coerec1771.html#jf">1771</a>, he was listed among the communicants at St. Peter's.

<p>Like the older "<a href="../../census1756.html#193">John Fryer</a>," this individual was an <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">inland sailor</a>. His marriage bond from February 1759, identified him as a resident of the city of Albany and a "skipper." 

<p>During the 1760s, his house and lot on the west side of the Manor were valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">ass</a>essment rolls. In 1767, John Fryer was listed on the rolls of a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>At the same time, qualitative information is available for an Albany-based, adult life. But the existence of several "John Fryers" on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> makes us more cautious in seeking to connect lifecourse information. 

<p>If he was the son of the skipper, he was dead as his name was not mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willjofryer.html">will</a> filed by John Fryer in 1783. We seek information on his later life and passing.
