<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Douw Fonda</strong></a> was born in September 1701. He was the son of <a href="jofonda3766.html">Jan</a> and <a href="../l/maloock5938.html">Maria Loockermans</a> Fonda. A middle child of a large <a href="../../census1697.html#068">Alb</a>any then Rensselaerswyck family, he was destined to become a city-based mainstay. A number of "Douw Fondas" appear to be at risk during his lifetime. This sketch <a href="../qqqq.html">strives</a> to focus on the Albany resident we call Douw J. Fonda.

<p>In October 1732, Douw married one "A." <a href="../vn/vness.html">Van Ness</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1744, perhaps four of their children had been christened in Albany. <a href="#dist">However</a>, a different "Douwe Fonda" also was baptizing children during that time. 

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22ye+house+of+douwe+fonda%22&source=bl&ots=GuMbYlYJOB&sig=_4IY_n_N_kw78RRwJgOwaG1LGxg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mWrIUMWAOOrD0AGShICYBA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ye%20house%20of%20douwe%20fonda%22&f=false">1728</a>, "Douwe Fonda's" <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house was referenced in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">1729</a>, he was named firemaster in the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1732">1732</a>, perhaps it was not this subject who was appointed constable for the third ward. Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">guess</a> that who we call Douwe J. first was elected assistant alderman for the second ward. That individual was re-elected in 1737 and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1738">1738</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3781">1742</a>, this "son of John Fonda" was so identified on a list of freeholders in the second ward.
<p>In January <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=%22dowe+fonda%22+january+6&source=bl&ots=sulX8v66Yg&sig=hVIX1uUZgvNRC70pBs43TPhyqDQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vnjIUO3SNMyJ0QGmpIHIDw&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22dowe%20fonda%22%20january%206&f=false">1743</a>, the city records last referenced "Dowe Fonda" by noting that he was among those who were delinquent in what they owed the city treasury.

<p>At this point, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> still seeking information about the later life and passing of this second ward resident. </p>
