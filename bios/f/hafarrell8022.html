<strong>Hanna Farrell</strong></a> (Ferrel, Farel, Ferro, <a href="../../res/sp.html">variants</a>) probably was 
born before 1730. We have yet to connect her to an Albany or other early New York family. 

<p>By the 1750s, she had become the wife of Albany native <a href="wmfryer8035.html">William Fryer</a>. Her husband was a <a href="../../census1756.html#188">baker</a> and  they became residents of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> living with or near other Fryer family members. By 1760, four daughters had been christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church where both parents were members. In 1768, she was a widow and her family had four members. 

<p>Beginning in February 1771, she had business with the Albany municipal government when a committee was formed to "get" a new well near her home. Over the next decade, her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">accounts</a> were paid by the city on a number of occasions. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, the "widow of Wm. Fryer" was acknowledged as the owner of a first ward property of modest value.

<p>Hanna Farrell Fryer was last referenced in May 1781 when her account with the city was paid in bushels of wheat.</p>
