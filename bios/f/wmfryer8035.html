<strong>William Fryer</strong></a> was born in March 1722. He was the eldest child of <a href="isfryer8033.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="elizfryer1859.html">Elizabeth Fryer</a>. He grew up in a weaver's home in Albany's  <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1746">1746</a>, he was appointed constable and then high constable for the first ward. In 1750 and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>, he was named <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>.

<p>In 1753, he was <a href="../../wills/willisfryer.html">bequeathed</a> a share of his father's estate - including the first ward house and lot. Isaac Fryer died in 1755 leaving a widow and several adult children as heirs.

<p>By the mid-1750s, he had married <a href="hafarrell8022.html">Hannah Farrell</a>. Between 1755 and 1760, their four children had been christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church where he was a member and church warden.

<p>William Fryer was a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#188">1756</a>, his home was included on a census of Albany householders. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#8035">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. In November 1764, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> of a Southside neighbor.  In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his first ward property was accorded a modest assessment. He probably still shared the home with his sister as, in 1767, <a href="cafryer8036.html">Catherine Fryer</a> was listed as the owner of record.

<p>William Fryer was dead by 1768, when his widow was referenced in the records St. Peter's church and in 1771 in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a>. He had lived less than fifty years.</p>
