<P><a href="#sources"><b>Alexander Forsyth/Forsight</b></a> was <a href="#origins">born</a> in Scotland about 1749. His name first appears in the community record when he married <a href="mafrasier8106.html">Mary/Molly Frasier</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in December 1776. Scottish people, their younger children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a>.</p>

<p>A carpenter by trade, in 1780 he was held back from military service at the request of Continental Quartermaster <a href="../../bios/l/morlewis.html">Morgan Lewis</a>.</p>


<p>By the end of the war, Alexander Forsyth had become a 
<a href="../../census1790.html#5904">fixture</a> in the second ward where he practiced his trade, raised a family, and served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fireman</a>. His <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Chapel Street</a> home was in the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5904">heart</a> of an enclave of recently arrived Scottish tradesmen. In 1789, he purchased an additional lot farther up the hill.</p>

        Forsyth lost his wife in 1804. A widower with several young children, 
        he lived at 65 Chapel Street until his death in 1818. His sons became 
        businessmen in nineteenth century Albany. He was buried in the <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">United 
        Presbyterian Church</a> <a href="../../dead.html">cemetery plot</a>. He 
        was sixty-nine years old and had lived in Albany for more than forty years. 
        His tombstone was found in 1988 in the backyard of a home near Washington 
        Park and on the road to Albany Rural Cemetery. It became an important 
        historical resource as it revealed that Alexander Forsyth had been born 
        in Scotland!</p>
