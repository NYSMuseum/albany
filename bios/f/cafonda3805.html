<P><a href="#sources"><b>Lyntie (Catharina) Fonda</b></a> was born in September 1761. She was the eldest daughter of Albany mainstays <a href="gysfonda3782.html">Gysbert</a> and <a href="../d/eldouw2080.html">Elsje Douw</a> Fonda.</p>


<p>In December 1780, she had not reached her twentieth birthday when she married newcomer <a href="../l/rilush1047.html">Richard Lush</a>. Over the next two decades, the marriage produced seven children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>Lyntie raised her family in a large <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">house</a> on Market Street from where Richard prospered until his death in 1817. Lyntie lived on in double house for the next fifteen years. Her 92-year-old mother died in the house at 320 North Market in July 1823.</p>

<p>The widow Lyntie Fonda Lush died in February 1832 and was buried from the Dutch church. She had lived in Albany for seventy-one years! Her will passed probate in July.</p>
