<P><a href="#sources"><b>John C. Fredenreich</b></a> was of German ancestry. He was born about 1752. In 1777, he was in New York and a <a href="#bounty">soldier</a> in John Burgoyne's army. Following the surrender, he escaped and hid out in Guilderland. Before long he married Eve Featherly and began a family. By <a href="../../census1790.html#8113">1790</a>, he had become a permanent resident of the city of Albany and the patriarch of a large and growing family!</p>


<p>Although his children were baptized in several Albany churches, he was a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.</p>

<p>In 1791, he had a meat market on the corner of Market Street and Maiden Lane. He often was called a grocer, victualler, and cordwainer. He may have been the partner of <a href="../s/joshep2460.html">John Shepherd</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#8113">1800</a> his first ward household  housed eight family members and a slave. At that time,  he was listed as a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../sources.html#ad">City directories</a> identified him as a butcher living at 84 <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">South Pearl Street</a> for many years. In 1820, three sons were listed as South End butchers as well.</p> 

<p>An Albany mainstay for more than forty years, John C. Fredenreich died in March 1821 at the age of sixty-nine! His will passed probate in October.</p>
