<strong>Douw I. Fonda</strong></a> was christened in July 1709. He was the son of <a href="isfonda3760.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../l/allansing3100.html">Alida Lansing</a> Fonda. He grew up in a businessman's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In March 1727, he married Aaltie (<a href="../../res/sp.html">A</a>lida) Ouderkerk at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Beginning in 1728, their children were christened in the church where both parents were frequent baptism sponsors and thus active at least as late as 1754.

<p>These young Fondas were Albany residents. In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1733">1733</a>, Douwe Isaacse was named high constable. He probably was the "Douwe Fonda" who was elected assistant alderman for the second ward in September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>. In July <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+9&id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&ots=ssp_5u99Tk#v=onepage&q=%22annals%20of%20albany%22%20volume%209&f=false">1737</a>, that individual purchased a lot in the second ward along the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">P</a>earl Street and next to the property of <a href="../b/joblo1480.html">Jan Maase</a>. The council minutes further described the property and set the terms of sale. He also was re-elected assistant alderman in 1737.

<p>In 1741, he was named a partner in the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga Patent</a>.

<p>Additional community-based information exists for Douw Fonda. However, at this point, we will <a href="#sources">step away</a> from this particular Douw  lest we further confuse the issues. See <a href="dofonda381.html">DIF381</a>.

The life of Douw I. <a href="fonda.html">Fonda</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 3808. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Perhaps a different (and more Mohawk valley centered) Douw Fonda married A. Van Ness in 1732. That marriage also produced a number of children during some of the time that Aaltie Ouderkerk was bearing Douw I. Fonda's children.
<dd>In case anyone feels they definitively know their Douw Fondas, you might consult <a href="http://www.newyorkfamilyhistory.org/modules.php?name=Sections&op=printpage&artid=128">Joe Fondy</a>'s well-done and interesting offering.
