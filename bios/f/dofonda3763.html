<strong>Douwe Jellis Fonda</strong></a> was born about 1645. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers Jellis Douwse and Hester Fonda. After a time in New Amsterdam, his father moved their family to the new village of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he died about 1659. His mother may have lived until 1690.


<p>About 1666, Douwe Jellis married <a href="../c/reconyn3765.html">Rebecca Conyn</a> and raised a large family that included several future residents of Albany.

<p>These Fondas lived just outside the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north gate</a> of Albany and were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#3763">1684</a>, his Albany taxes were in arrears. In 1676, he also owned land in what became Troy.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#3763">1697</a>, his <a href="../../loc/northend.html">No</a>rth End household of six people was configured under the census of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.


<p>Douwe Jellis Fonda is thought to have died in December 1700 when his widow paid for use of his pall.</p>
