<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacobus Fonda</strong></a> was born in December 1746. He was the son of Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#258">ta</a>ilor <a href="abfonda3777.html">Abraham I.</a> and Maria <a href="../vs/mavschoon5902.html">Van Schoonhoven</a> Fonda. Named for his maternal <a href="../vs/jgvschoon5896.html">gr</a>andfather, he <a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> would be known as "James Fonda."

<p>As a young adult, he continued to reside in his father's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home. He probably was the "& son" considered under Abraham's <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> during  the mid-1760s. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, "Jacob" was named constable for the third ward. Later, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=%22jacobus+fonda%22&source=bl&ots=wxhHaYBefs&sig=Ne6WIQPTWJ1l-ulUe4f57RUDOXE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KwQxUMjnAvTz6wHFpIHQCA&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22jacobus%20fonda%22&f=false">appointed</a> high constable.

<p>Almost thirty at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, we expect to be able to connect him to wartime activities. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3787">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3787">1779</a>, his personal property was assessed under his father's household. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October</a>, his Albany property was valued separately on the assessment roll.  

<p>In August 1783, he married Albany native <a href="../b/wibogert6152.html">Willempie Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1798, the couple had christened ten children in Albany. Initially, these Fondas lived in the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4283">house</a> of Willempie's widowed mother.

<p>After the war, Jacobus/James resumed his association with the city government as a <a href="../../org/cc.html#1788">fireman</a>, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false">con</a>tractor, and, beginning in 1794, was appointed city watchman.


<p>Jacobus Fonda was a <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith</a> who lived in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">second</a> and then third ward. In <a href="../../census1790.html#3787">1790</a>, his household had five members. By <a href="../../census1800.html#3787">1800</a>, six children under ten joined James, his wife, and another girl in their third ward home.

<p>"James Fonday" was buried from his church in October 1807. His widow <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=%22fonda+widow willimpy%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22fonda%20widow willimpy%22&f=false">lived</a> on in their Market Street home.</p>
