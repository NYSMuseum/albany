<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Fonda</strong></a> is <a href="http://www.fonda.org/files/Fonda_Oct15.pdf">said</a> to have been born in Greenbush but christened at the Dutch church in Stone Arabia in March 1754. She was the daughter of Jellis and Jannetje Wemple Fonda. Her father became a prominent businessman, landowner, and patriot leader based in Caughnawaga. Young Maria's marriage would connect her Fondas to the Albany Van Vechtens.

      <p>Maria is said to have married Albany native <a href="../vv/antvvechten2392.html">Anthony 
        Van Vechten</a> in Stone Arabia in April 1770. Their son was christened 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in November 1771. 
        At least seven subsequent baptisms took place at the Stone Arabia church. 
      <p>These Van Vechtens probably left Albany for the Mohawk Valley shortly after the birth of their first son.

<p>In <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHKG-LQM">1790</a>, their household was configured on the census in Caughnawaga. At that time, their family consisted of eight members.
 
<p><p>Maria Van Vechten is <a href="http://www.biblerecords.com/mounta4.jpg">said</a> to have died in June 1800 at the age of forty-six. The same source notes Anthony Van Vechten's passing in October of 1812. However, yet another family-based "record" <a href="http://www.fonda.org/files/Fonda_Oct15.pdf">claimed</a> that she survived until 1830 when a same-named individual was buried at Tribe's Hill, Montgomery County.

Information on Maria's life and on her family has relied on a more recent <a href="http://www.fonda.org/files/Fonda_Oct15.pdf">online compilation</a> (pp.67-69) of family-based resources and conventional wisdom. Beyond that resource, we have not actively tracked Maria's family beyond Albany.
