<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Fryer</b></a> was born about 1720. He was the eldest son of Albany newcomers <a href="isfryer8033.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="elizfryer1859.html">Elizabeth</a> Fryer. He grew up along <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> in a house probably built by his father about the time of John's birth. Their neighbors were a mix of <a href="../../garrison.html#gf">soldier families</a> and older residents including the <a href="../vz/vzandt.html">Van Zandts</a>.</p>


<p>About 1745, he married Albany native <a href="../vz/anvzandt239.html">Anna Van Zandt</a> - a daughter of the Fryers' Southside neighbors. By 1760, six of their children had been baptized at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church where he was a member.</p>

<p>John Fryer came of age during the 1740s and served as a constable in the first ward. He supplied candles and other items to the city government. In <a href="../../census1756.html#193">1756</a>, his house was identified as a dramshop. By that time, he had become a <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">slooper</a> and carried cargoes on the Hudson for many clients for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>In 1766, he was elected assistant alderman for the first ward and served for several years. With the passing of his father in 1755, he had become head of the <a href="fryer.html">Fryer</a> family and prominent in a number of community-based activities - including serving as a lieutenant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.</p>

<p>At the onset of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">difficulties</a> during the mid-1770s, this active skipper supported the Revolutionaries, contributing for supplies, signing the Association, and keeping the wells in the first ward. Absent from most wartime rolls, this English-ancestry native son must not have been considered disaffected. Later, he was awarded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html"> land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia.</P>


<p>Captain John Fryer filed a <a href="../../wills/willjofryer.html">will</a> in November 1783. It named his daughters and grandchildren as his wife and sons had passed on. John Fryer died in July 1784 at the age of sixty-four. His <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/burnewsp.html">obituary</a> appeared in the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a>. He was buried in the Dutch Reformed churchyard.</p>
