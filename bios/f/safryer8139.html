<P><a href="#sources"><b>Sarah Fryer</b></a> was born in February 1752. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jofryer8034.html">John</a> and <a href="../vz/anvzandt239.html">Anna Van Zandt</a> Fryer. She grew up on the <a href="../../bios/vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> of Albany in the family of a sloop captain.</p>


<p>In January 1774, she married newcomer <a href="../w/edwillett6905.html">Edward S. Willett</a>. By 1782, the marriage had produced seven children. Six years earlier, the sixteen-year-old became a pewholder in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where most of her children would be christened.</p>

<p>In November 1783, she was identified as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjofryer.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>These Willetts were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#6905">mainliners</a> who lived on what became <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> near other members of the Fryer and Van Zandt families.</p> 

<p>Edward S. Willett died in 1810. Widow Sarah Fryer Willett continued to live in their home at 18 <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl</a> Street. Later, she moved in with her daughter where she died at the end of December 1831. She had lived almost seventy-one years.</p>
