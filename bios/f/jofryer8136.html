<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John W. Fryer</strong></a> was born during the 1760s. He probably was the son of baker <a href="wmfryer8035.html">William Fryer</a> who had passed on by 1766. Raised by his widowed mother, the former <a href="hafarrell8022.html">Hannah Farrell</a>, he was most often referred to as "John W. Fryer."

<p><a href="http://www.sterlingflatwarefashions.com/Silversmiths/SilversmithsF5.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/mc/detjowfryerspoon.jpg" align=right width=200 vspace=1 hspace=1 border=1 alt="mark on spoon made by John W. Fryer about 1790"></a>From his youth, John W. Fryer was known in the community as a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a>. In May of 1784, the Albany <a href="../../doc/nn1.html#1784">newspaper</a> advertized that  "<a href="#balch">Balch</a> & Fryer [had] opened a shop near the north gate, for the purpose of carrying on the gold and silversmith's business. The north gate at this time is believed to have been a little above Columbia street in <a href="../../streets.html#market">Broadway</a>. 

<p>In April 1788, he married his childhood <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> neighbor, innkeeper's daughter <a href="../d/nadenniston.html">Nancy Denniston</a> at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. At that time, both partners were said to have been "of Albany." However, in September 1791, he was confirmed in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. Their son was christened at St. Peter's in August 1789.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#8136">1790</a>, his household showed only the young couple. The first ward census for <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, showed two "John Fryars" with likely configured households. At this point, we <a href="../qqqq.html">hesitate</a> in assigning census and other qualitative information for what surely was more than one "John Fryer."


<p>This (John W.) silversmith was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a> and served as its secretary in 1801.
<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=%22fryer+john w%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22fryer%20john w%22&f=false">1813</a>, this city mainliner was identified as a silversmith and living at 21 Washington Street which beginning in 1817 was called the rear of 21 <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl</a> Street. This distinctively named silversmith last was listed in the directory in 1819.

<p>John W. Fryer is said to have died in 1820. The directory for <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1820</a> identified Nancy the widow of John W. Fryer at that address.</p>
