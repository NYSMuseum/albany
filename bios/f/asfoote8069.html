<P>Based on demographics from the census of <a href="../../census1800.html#8069">1800</a> entry, 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Asa Foote</strong></a> was born    after <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-3sPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA211&lpg">1756</a>. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=M1N2rD9tnlcC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22asa+foote%22+albany&source=web&ots=KgeMq5Eyg1&sig=tP2DCZHqw7f4q5dnqHYrJmJAKok&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result">Perhaps</a> he was the son of Ephraim and Lydia Cushman Foote. That New England family eminated from Connecticut.

<p>In January 1790, he married Catalyntie David (perhaps Davis) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1803, four children had been christened at the church.

<p> In 1799, his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was accorded a moderate assessment. However, his personal property was valued separately (just below his holdings on the tax list) in association with innkeeper <a href="../w/izwetmore6869.html">Izrahiah Wetmore</a>. The <a href="../../census1800.html#8069">next year</a>,  he was listed as the head of a household probably on Court Street. That household consisted of four boys and two adult women. 

<p>We have uncovered no community-based references for Asa Foote after the christening of his last child in 1803.

<p>He probably was not the close kinsman of Albany resident <a href="ebfoote8070.html">Ebenezer Foote</a> - an attorney and a founder of the Albany Academy for Girls who died in 1814.
