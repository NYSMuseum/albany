<strong>Matthew Flensburgh</strong></a> probably was born during the 1690s. Thus, he would have been the son of Johannes Flensburgh who <a href="../../newcomers.html">emigrated</a> from Germany to New York during the 1670s. His brother was Albany resident <a href="daflens8041.html">Daniel Flensburgh</a>.


<p>In February 1716, he married <a href="../vz/mavzandt306.html">Maria Van Zandt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1737, ten children were christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>In 1718, he had a house on the southside of Albany near the stockade and the corner of what became Hudson and Green <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Streets</a>. The "horseguard" was situated behind his house. Two years later, he purchased an additional lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#8042">1720</a>, he was counted among the freeholders living in the first ward. In 1725, he was <a href="../../wills/willdaflens8041.html">named</a> co-executor of his brother's estate. During the early 1730s, he was closely involved with the city government as a contractor working on the jail, blockhouses, and stockade. He was elected assistant alderman from <a href="../../org/cc.html#1732">1732</a> to 1734. 

<p>Matthew Flensburgh died in June 1739 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
