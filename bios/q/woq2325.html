<strong>Wouter Quackenbush</strong></a> was born in August 1735. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents Pieter and Anna Oothout Quackenbush.


<p>In October 1763, he married Bata (Barbara) Knoet (Clute).. She died after bearing one child. In December 1766, he married Catharina Roseboom. He was a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps, he fathered only the one child.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his name appeared on an Albany assessment roll. In 1767, the assessment roll for the "West Manor," noted the home of Peter Quackenbush and son Wouter. <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2325">Subsequent</a> tax rolls identified his Albany holdings. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2325">1790</a>, the census enumerated the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of "Walter" Quackenbush.

<p>In 1766, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willvovdb2441.html">will</a> of his neighbor.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>, he supported the American cause in a number of less active ways and later was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1768">1768</a>, he was named to serve as a firemaster. Later, he belonged to an Albany fire company. He also was reimbursed by the city for services. In 1797, he was identified as a cooper and freeholder living in the third ward. In October 1800, he sold a lot along Foxes Creek on <a href="../../streets.html#montgomery">Montgomery Street</a> to Philip W. De Foreest.
  
<p>The <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census for 1800 showed him living alone. In 1810, his name appeared on the "Colonie" census. However, Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> for 1815-17 listed him at 240 North Market Street. 

<p>Wouter Quackenbush died in 1817. His will passed probate in October.</p>
