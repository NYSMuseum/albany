      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Wouter Pieterse</b></a> was born in Holland about 
        1644. He was the second son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> 
        pioneers <a href="piq.html">Pieter</a> and Maria Quackenbush. His father 
        came to America about 1653. Wouter operated then owned a brickyard on 
        the flats <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> of what became the 
        city of Albany.</p>
      <p>About 1671, he married <a href="../vd/covdb5748.html">Neeltje Gysberts 
        Vandenbergh</a>. The last of their children was baptized in 1691 at the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member 
        and frequent baptism sponsor.</p>
      <p>In 1676, he obtained land outside of Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north 
        gate</a> where he made his home. Over the next decades, subsequent land 
        deals added more acreage between <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes</a> 
        and Patroon's Creeks. His household consisting of a man, a woman, and 
        four children was configured on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        census taken in <a href="../../census1697.html#2322">1697</a>. 
      <p>In 1715, he became a <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> British 
        subject. Wouter Pieterse Quackenbush died sometime afterward. His widow 
        lived until 1736!</p>
