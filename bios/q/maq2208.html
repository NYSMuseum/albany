<strong>Maria Quackenbush</strong></a> was born in April 1702. She was the daughter of <a href="woq2323.html">Wouter</a> and <a href="../b/cobogert1017.html">Cornelia Bogert</a> Quackenbush. Maria grew up in her father's house in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany and at his farm in  
<a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. She was one of the five children named in the will filed by her father in August 1711. Her mother and father died in 1735 and 1736.</P>

<p>In October 1725, she married Albany native <a href="../d/jodef4712.html">Johannes De Foreest</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Bu 1741, twelve children had been christened in the Albany church where both parents were frequent baptism sponsors.

<p>This De Foreest family made its home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> from where Johannes plied the brazier's trade. 

<p> in June 1750, she was left a bible and personal property in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Aj8GAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:04N2YCEYfNTUxNcVtUa3zoC#v=onepage&q=&f=false">will</a> filed by Elbert Lieverse of New York.
 
 <P>Fifty-two-year-old Maria Quackenbush De Foreest was left a widow when her husband died in June 1754. We seek information on her later life and passing.</p>
