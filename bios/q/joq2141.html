<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes W. Quackenbush</strong></a> was born in November 1709. He was the last child born to Albany residents <a href="woq2323.html">Wouter Quackenbush, Jr.</a> and his wife, <a href="../b/cobogert1017.html">Cornelia Bogert</a> Quackenbush. He grew up near the waterfront in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany.
 
<p>In December 1730, Johannes married Margarita Bogert in New York City. By 1744, their ten children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>This Quackenbush family made its home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1735, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In 1739,  Johannes was <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">elected</a> assistant alderman. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2141">1742</a> his name was on the list of third ward freeholders.

<p>In 1733, he was allowed to use the land his <a href="q.html">family</a> previously had sold to the city. In 1739, he purchased and sold land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> to the Albany government. At that time, Johannes Quackenbush had a house in Schaghticoke. During the 1740s, he performed bridge and well repairs for the city government. At that time, he also had a number of disagreements with the municipal government regarding land to be taken for fortifications.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#328">1756</a>, he may have been the individual named "Jno. Quackenbush" identified as a shoemaker on a census of city houses made by the British army.

<p>Johannes W. Quackenbush subsequently moved to New York and lived into the 1770s. Perhaps he was the John W. Quackenbush associated with a will filed in New York in September 1771. According to his <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible26.htm">bible</a>, this John Quackenbush died in New York on December 22, 1774.
