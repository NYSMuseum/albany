<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Quackenbush</strong></a> was born  in September 1691. She was the youngest daughter of <a href="wopq2322.html">Wouter P.</a> and <a href="../vd/covdb5748.html">Neeltie Vandenbergh </a> Quackenbush. Her father was a brickmaker who raised his <a href="../../census1697.html#2322">family</a> on the flats just beyond the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">northern</a> border of Albany.

<p>By 1711, she had married Albany native <a href="../g/nigroesbeck3370.html">Nicholas Groesbeck</a>. By 1728, their marriage had produced seven children. As Nicholas recently had secured the right to extract clay for brickmaking, this Groesbeck family was becoming established in eighteenth century Albany. 

<p>However, at the end of December 1728, the Dutch church recorded the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/chbur_gp.html">burial</a> of "Maria, the wife of Nicholas Groesbeck," in the church yard. Within a few years Groesbeck had re-married and then relocated the family to New Jersey where he lived into his sixties. His first wife, Maria Quackenbush Groesbeck, had lived but thirty-two years.</p>
