<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit Quackenbush</strong></a> lived in Albany from at least the 1760s to the early 1800s. A number of same-named individuals are <a href="../../res/guess.html">at risk</a> during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. The most learned family-based <a href="../../fhg.html#qfa">resource</a> suggests that may have been born in August 1763 and would have been the son of Anthony Quackenbush of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> and his second wife, Anna La Grange (widow Bogert).

<p>Unless he married Elizabeth Banker at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in April 1791 and had daughters with her in 1797 and in 1800 (Heldebergh DRC), we still seek family information for him.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#2103">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">sec</a>ond ward household included a couple and three young children. Assessment rolls for 1799 and 1802 <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">valued</a> his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> moderately.

<p>His name was included on a <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">list</a> of members of the Dutch church "Great Consistory" dated May 17, 1805.

<p>After that, the name of Gerrit Quackenbush has not yet been encountered in the community-based record. With many unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on for now!
