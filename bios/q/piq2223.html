<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Quackenbush</strong></a> probably was born about 1680. He is believed to have been the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="piq.html">Pieter</a> and Maria Quackenbush. He grew up in a large family in the homes of an Albany area brickmaker and landholder.

<p>In November 1701, he married <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> native Neeltje Marens at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, he was a single man born and living in Albany. By 1716, the marriage had produced seven children who were christened in the church where both parents were frequent baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">1701</a>, his name appeared on a petition signed by a number of loyal Protestant merchants of Albany County.
<p>In 1702 and in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2223">1709</a>, his Albany property was valued on the second and then first ward city assessment rolls.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>In 1717, the provincial treasury authorized payment in precious metal for his having carried freight from New York to Albany during the administration of Lord Cornbury.

<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, his name (Quackumbus) began to appear on a list of freeholders for Schenectady. In 1722, he is said to have settled (the <a href="http://history.rays-place.com/ny/mont-glen.htm">first</a> white inhabitant) on "Scott's Patent."

<p>In 1733, he is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have bought lands on the Mohawk River from <a href="../c/ecollins.html">Edward Collins</a>. Perhaps, that tract was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willpevdriessen.html">will</a> filed by Domine <a href="../vd/pevdriessen6692.html">Petrus Van Driessen</a> in January 1738 which stated that he had previously purchased tract of land located north of the Mohawk from Pieter and Neeltie Quackenbush. 

<p>In June 1735, he was paid thirty shillings from the Albany treasury for the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22quackenboss&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22quackenboss&f=false">loss</a> he sustained from having stones for the city wall laid on his land.


<p>According to church records, Pieter Quackenbush died in July 1748 and was buried from the church.</p>
