<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referenced variously ("E. C. Quinn") <a href="#sources"><strong>Emmanuel C. Quinn</strong></a> owned a parcel of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">prop</a>erty in the city of Albany during the late 1790s. He is best <a href="../../res/ts.html">known</a> as the "master builder" of the first <a href="../../org/stmarys.html">Catholic church</a> in Albany. All <a href="../../cbr.html">encountered</a> references to him are grouped within a few years of 1800. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In February 1795, he leased a lot (described as lot 22 on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> to <a href="../../streets.html#norton">Church Street</a> and south of Lydius Street - lot 21 adjoining) from <a href="../vr/psvr5106.html">Philip S. Van Rensselaer</a>. In April 1802, he appears to have <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">conveyed</a> that parcel to <a href="../h/abhunt.html">Abijah Hunt</a>. The property would have been in the vicinity of Court Street. However, his name appears to be absent from the <a href="../../census1800.html">census</a> rolls at that time.

<p>In 1798, his name (as master builder) was among those inscribed on the <a href="../../org/stmarys.html#ihs">cornerstone</a> of St. Mary's church.  However, we was not listed among the prominent parishioners of that time.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and personal property were valued on the city assessment for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. At that time, an unoccupied lot in the first ward  was valued modestly. Also, he owned another house and lot in the first ward that was occupied by <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> John Tibo. These three parcels probably were located in what became the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">Southend</a> - mostly south of Lydius Street.

<p>His address was not included in the first city directory in 1813 or in any subsequent annual listings. Past diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now still seeking information on his activities from 1802 on.

<p>Emmanuel C. Quinn was dead by May 1816 when letters of administration were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">granted</a> on his estate in Albany County.</p>
