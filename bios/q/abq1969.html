<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham Quackenbush</strong></a> probably was born between 1756 and 1774. We move <a href="../qqqq.html">cautiously</a> here with <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/customsearchresults.asp?LDS=1&region=11&last_name=Quackenbusch&first_name=Abraham">many</a> same-named individuals potentially at risk in the region. 

<p><a href="#per"><b>P</b></a>erhaps, he first married an Elizabeth <a href="../l/lagrange.html">La Grange</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in September 1788. No christenings have been found for them in the available records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, their daughter was christened at the Dutch <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/jerus04.htm">Jerusalem Reformed</a> church in Feura Bush in January 1796. Then, his second (or first) wife may have been Caty <a href="../r/rad.html">Rad</a>liff. Their four children (Lawrence, John, Peter, Abraham) were christened in the Albany church between 1795 and 1802 and are accounted for in the survey documents considered below.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property of $15 was valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment under the house and property of <a href="../t/rathomp.html">Ralph Thompson</a> and near the <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tannery</a> owned by Lansing & Waters.


<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#1969">1800</a>, the city census configured his first ward household with three boys. A decade later, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> taker noted five people (including two adult men and an adult woman) living in his household.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22abraham+cooper%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20cooper%22&f=false">1813</a>, Abraham Quackenbush was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as a cooper on Mark Lane or at 44 Dock Street. As late as 1821, the annual directory listed this cooper at 44 Dock Street and his home at 30 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson</a>. 

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Albany resident Abraham Quackenbush. </p>
