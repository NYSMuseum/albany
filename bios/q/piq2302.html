<P>Sometimes referred to as, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter W. Quackenbush</strong></a>, this individual was born in June 1706. He was the son of <a href="woq2323.html">Wouter</a> Jr. and <a href="../b/cobogert1017.html">Cornelia Bogert</a> Quackenbush. He was a younger child in the moderate-sized family of an Albany resident who also had ties to <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>.

<p>He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been named in the will <a href="woq2323.html#will">filed</a> by his father in 1711. 

<p>Perhaps he is the Rensselaerswyck cooper <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc15213.htm">mentioned</a> in a real estate transaction dated October 29, 1728.

<p>In December 1733, he married <a href="../o/anoo405.html">Anna Oothout</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1742, three sons had been christened in Albany. The wife of Pieter Quackenbush" was buried in February 1757. He (Pieter Wouter) is said to have made some entries in a Quackenbush family <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible27.htm">bible</a> regarding his sons.

<p>He seems to be the <a href="../../res/guess.html">most likely</a> first builder of the landmark <a href="../../loc/qhouse.html">Quackenbush House</a>.

<p>In October 1738, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">will</a> of his father-in-law as his wife was due to inherit a share of Oothout's estate..

<p>This Albany native made his home in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> where he was listed as a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2302">1742</a>. Perhaps he was the Pieter who was listed on the list of Albany County freeholders in 1763. However, at least one other same-named individual is a possible candidate.

<p>He is <a href="../../fhg.html#qfa">said</a> to have filed a will in May 1782. It stated that he was of the "West District of the Manor." 

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Pieter W. Quackenbush. </p>
