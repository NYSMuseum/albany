<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, this <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Quackenbush</strong></a> (aka "Pieter Bont") was the patriarch of the Albany <a href="q.html">Quackenbush</a> family.

<p>He is said to have been born in Holland in 1614 and to have emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> by the early 1650s. 

<p>Existing resources on his life have been well-chronicled in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Yi5JAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=%2quackenbush&source=bl&ots=YC0t3yaI2i&sig=mjezd_dWkdeOIkW7vVffd_Cqxvc&hl=en&ei=1F_QS4L6DISglAe5wNWwDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22quackenbush&f=false">substantial</a> yet not always consistent <a href="../../fhg.html#qfa">family-based resources</a>.  

<p>At this point, we are uncertain about much of the life of this Pieter Quackenbush. The Quackenbush patriarch left a large family in Albany and its environs. However, there is little agreement regarding the identity of his wife(s) and their mother. However, her name <a href="../../res/ts.html">seems</a> to have been <a href="../../res/sp.html">Maria</a>. Between 1640 and 1663, perhaps eight and maybe even ten children had been born in Europe and America.

<p>His name is missing from the <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">lists</a> of fur traders of 1660 and from the <a href="../../census1679.html">census</a> of Albany householders taken in 1679. Nor does he seem to have been invited to the <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html">funeral</a> of Jeremias Van Rensselaer in 1674.

<p>In July 1668, he purchased a <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">brick</a>yard in Albany. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1683ssl">1683</a>, his name appeared on a <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> subscription list and noted that he lived "outside the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North Gate</a>."

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#later">January 1687</a>, he exchanged his house, pantile shed, and land in Rensselaerswyck with <a href="../vv/javvorst6427.html">Jacob Van Vorst</a> for Jacob's house and lot in Albany and "twenty beavers." At that time Pieter Quackenbush noted that he was residing near Albany in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.
 
<p>Just about all the family-based information encountered so far is mostly <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA193&lpg=PA193&dq=%22pieter+quackenbush%22&source=bl&ots=aLLAQpPeqL&sig=7ZMQQ5OrBJpxqH7wb3yDUw-ZGyA&hl=en&ei=fnjQS-miKsSBlAfVwqimDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CBgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22pieter%20quackenbush%22&f=false">derivative</a> and not necessarily correct.

<p>We seek information on his life in Albany and his passing. 

<p>"The founder" was the first of several generations of individuals named Pieter Quackenbush to live in early Albany and its environs. This profile hopes to organize and present valid and <a href="../../criteria.html">focused</a> information on their lives.</p>
