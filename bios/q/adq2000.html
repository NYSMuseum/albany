<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Adrian Quackenbush</strong></a> was born about 1675. He was a middle son in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="piq.html">Pieter</a> and Maria Quackenbush. His father was a brickmaker who owned properties in and around Albany.

<p>In January 1699, he married <a href="../vs/cavschaick7005.html">Catharina Van Schaick</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. It was the first marriage for both Albany residents. By 1719, nine children had been christened at their Albany church.

<p>In June 1699, he was one of those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7#v=onepage&q&f=false">cited</a> for not actually possessing freedom of the city by the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a>. That action may have meant that he was not actually born within the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a> and perhaps in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1699pmc">1700</a>, he was among those merchants who <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/documentsrelativ08newy#page/754/mode/2up">petitioned</a> the provincial government for protection and for support relating to the <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian trade</a>.

<p>In January 1701, he signed a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">receipt</a> in a property transaction on behalf of his wife and relating to her late father's estate. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his property in the third ward was accorded a moderate assessment. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2000">1709</a>, his first ward house received a moderate assessment.

<p>In May 1719, he successfully petitioned the council for land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. The land was leased and was described as meadow and woodland. In 1720, he was identified as a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">freeholder</a> at Schaghticoke.

<p>In <a href="../../fhg.html#qfa">1732</a>, Adrian Quackenbush sold his Schaghticoke holdings to Daniel Ketelhuyn after first offering to sell them back to the city of Albany.

<p>He died sometime thereafter. His widow survived for more than a decade after her husband's death. A <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bio138.htm">number</a> of their offspring became Schaghticoke residents.  </p>
