<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas N. Quackenbush</strong></a> was born in August 1764. He was the eldest surviving son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck residents Nicholas and Catherine Van Pelt Quackenbush. He grew up in a family whose development was cut short by the death of his mother in 1775. His father would live until 1813 but did not re-marry. This individual was known as "Nicholas N. Quackenbush" to distinguish him from his father and other prominent, same-named contemporaries.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2215">1790</a>, he was accounted for under the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> household of his father in close proximity to other family members.

<p>In December 1792, Nicholas was twenty-eight when he married Albany native <a href="../g/angansevoort4676.html">Anna Gansevoort</a> at the "Bought" Dutch church. Six years earlier, in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1786sl">1786</a>, he contributed one pound to support a second minister in Albany. By 1807, the marriage had produced four children.
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his lot and wharf in the third ward (<a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay Street</a>) were valued on the assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#2215">1800</a>, his household was configured on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census. Afterwards, his residence on Market Street was counted in Albany as the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a> had migrated northward.

<p>Nicholas N. Quackenbush was an <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a> who was licensed to practice law in November <a href="http://www.cowanauctions.com/upcoming_category_list.asp?SaleId=69&cat=2096&mcat=1014">1785</a>. He held a number of <a href="http://www.cowanauctions.com/upcoming_category_list.asp?SaleId=69&cat=2096&mcat=1014">other</a> legal and judicial commissions/licenses as well.

<p>In <a href="http://dl.tufts.edu/view_votingrecord.jsp?pid=tufts:ny.assembly.albany.1801">1801</a>, he was an unsuccessful candidate for the state <a href="../../org/ass.html">Ass</a>embly. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=e637shhPEdMC&pg=PA482&lpg=PA482&dq=%22nicholas+n+quackenbush%22&source=bl&ots=tBKrp9jdBK&sig=_c4Xv_BbpqX_7ANZopI_Ri9nLTo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m5dXT82kD_SO0QGtlpTfDw&ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20n%20quackenbush%22&f=false">1804</a>, he was among the notable residents who were named to a commission on building a new state capitol in Albany that would house city offices as well.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22quackenbush+nicholas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22quackenbush%20nicholas%22&f=false">1813</a>, the Market Street home of this attorney was listed in the city directory.
 
<p>Nicholas N. Quackenbush <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22nicholas+n+quackenbush%22&source=bl&ots=cNnRYFgeUV&sig=H-aNCcXMti8MHkIa6A2kFKw70-A&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kIVXT_iYBPTq0QG86IykDw&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20n%20quackenbush%22&f=false">died</a> at his residence in January 1823. He had lived fifty-eight years.  Widow Ann continued to live in their home at 272 North Market Street until her passing in December 1828. Subsequently, the will of Nicholas N. Quackenbush (which is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Yi5JAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA112&lpg=PA112&dq=&source=bl&ots=YC_B1zbJ3l&sig=NbGzkofeBOMDMrEWyzEM-EJTdRM&hl=en&ei=_WIWS9_jC8fUlAfhy7DMBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=nicholas n.&f=false">said</a> to have distributed a substantial estate) did not pass <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> until 1843.</p>
