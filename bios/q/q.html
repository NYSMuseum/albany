        from <a href="piq.html">Pieter</a> and perhaps Maria Quackenbush who came 
        to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the 1650s. He was 
        known as a brickmaker. Three sons raised families in what became New York. 
        Sons <a href="joq2139.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="wopq2322.html">Wouter 
        Pieterse</a> established the family site just beyond the north gate of 
        Albany. Their daughter, <a href="coq2031.html">Cornelia</a>, married brewer 
        and Albany mayor Albert Janse Ryckman.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, two Quackenbush households 
        (<a href="joq2139.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="woq2323.html">Wouter 
        Jr.</a>) were present in the city of Albany. In <a href="../../census1756.html#328">1756</a>, 
        only one Quackenbush home was counted among the city's 330 households.</p>

<p>In 1790, <a href="woq2325.html">Walter Quackenbush</a> was living in 
        the third ward. But five Quackenbush-named households were counted in 
        adjoining <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a> including 
        that of Colonel <a href="heq2111.html">Hendrick Quackenbush</a> - who 
        further developed the family plot and <a href="../../loc/qhouse.html">home</a> 
        located <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north of the city</a> and along 
        the Hudson River. A <a href="../../im/im1794.html">map</a> dated 1794 
        recognized "Quackenbush Street" leading from North Market to the river 
        as the center of this tract of land. In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, the city census counted three Quackenbush named households. </p>
		
<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22quacken%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22quacken%22&f=false">1813</a>, four Quackenbush households including the aMarket Street home of attorney <a href="ninq.html">Nicholas N. Quackenbush</a> were listed in the first Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.		
		
      <p>The Quackenbush name is found throughout the land that was settled as 
        <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. A consistent presence in the city of 
        Albany throughout the period, people named Quackenbush were more prominent 
        in the countryside <a href="../../albanycounty.html">around</a> Albany and also in New Jersey.
