<P><a href="#sources"><b>Wouter Quackenbush, Jr.</b></a> was born in 1671. He was the eldest son of <a href="wopq2322.html">Wouter</a> and <a href="../vd/covdb5748.html">Neeltie Vandenbergh</a> Quackenbush. He grew up at his father's brickyard located on the flats just <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> of the Albany stockade gate.</p>

<p>In October 1696, he married <a href="../b/cobogert1017.html">Cornelia Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1709, five children had been christened in the Albany church where Wouter, Jr. was a member and an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>By <a href="../../census1697.html#114">1697</a>, his third ward house was configured on the Albany census. Two years later he joined his Albany neighbors in pledging <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2323">allegiance</a> to the king of England. Subsequent <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2323">assessment rolls</a> placed a modest value on his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> property. He also was among the pioneer developers of Albany's lands at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. </p>

<p>Wouter Quackenbush, Jr. filed a <a href="#will">will</a> in August 1711. It named his wife and five children as heirs. He died in November 1736 and was buried in Albany.</p>
