<strong>Cornelia Quackenbush</strong></a> was born in September 1699. She was the daughter of <a href="woq2323.html">Wouter</a> and <a href="../b/cobogert1017.html">Cornelia Bogert</a>  Quackenbush. She grew up near her family's holdings in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany.


<p>In August 1718, she married <a href="../d/jedef4711.html">Jesse De Foreest</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740, nine children had been christened in Albany.

<p>This De Foreest family raised their family near their kin along the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North Albany</a> waterfront where Jesse served as an alderman during the 1730s and '40s.  

<p>Jesse De Foreest was buried in September 1756. Possibly while he was still alive, "Nilky was <a href="../../census1756.html#52">identifed</a> at the head of their Albany household and was called a "merchant." During the next years, Jesse's accounts with the city were paid to his widow. During the 1760s, Neeltie's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> holdings were valued substantially on city assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a>. She also owned a lot in the first ward. Her comparatively high <a href="../../cbr.html">public visibility</a> probably indicates that Neeltie was continuing her late husband's business.
<p>Cornelia Quackenbush De Foreest's passing in April 1773 was noted in the family <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible16.htm">bible</a> with the entry: "1773, April 12, my mother Neiletje Quackenbush died between 5 and 6 P. M., at the age of 76 years she would have been had she lived until 22 August." </p>
