<P><A href="#biography"><B>Hendrick Quackenbush</B></A> was born in August 1737. He was a middle son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents Peter W. Quackenbush and his wife, the former Anna Oothout.</P>

<P><a href="#tradition">Family tradition</a> holds that he began as a trader who frequently ventured into the Mohawk Valley. After the fall of New France, he made a trip to Holland. Thus, he settled into an Albany life later than many of his contemporaries. Prior to his twenty-seventh birthday, he married <a href="../o/mgtoo688.html">Margarita Oothout</a> of New Jersey in 1764. She died  following the birth of their fifth child in 1770. In 1776, he married Elizabeth Roseboom. That marriage was probably childless. Hendrick was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>, baptism sponsor, and a church officer.</P>


<p>His home was on the Quackenbush property located on the northern border of the city. He also held lots along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> which were used as tanning pits. His residence east of the road from Albany to the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> was an well-known <a href="../../loc/qhouse.html">landmark</a> and still stands today! His household including nine slaves is listed in the Watervliet section of the <a href="../../census1790.html#2111">census of 1790</a>.</p>

<p>Hendrick Quackenbush served as a private in the colonial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and fought in the <a href="../../7yw.html">last of the wars</a> with the French. However, with the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, he was commissioned an officer in the revolutionary militia. In 1766, he <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">signed</a> the "General Association."He served at the battle of Saratoga and ultimately rose to be colonel of an Albany militia regiment. He also served as a stalwart member of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>, Safety, and Protection.  

<p>With the end of the war, he returned to business - managing to offset losses incurred by loaning large sums of money to the Revolutionary cause. He then acquired tracts of investment land in northern New York and a number of farms in what became Saratoga and Washington Counties.</p>

<p>He represented Albany County in the New York State Assembly in 1779; served as a presidential elector in 1804, and was appointed one of the trustees of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> in 1795.</p>

<p>Hendrick Quackenbush died on February 4, 1813 at the age of seventy-six. His will passed probate that June. His remains and <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~ghosthunter/quackenbush000.htm">stone</a> are at rest at Albany Rural <a href="../../dead.html">Cemetery</a>.</p>
