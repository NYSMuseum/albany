<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Johannes Quackenbush</strong></a> was born in Holland during the 1640s. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers Pieter and Maria Quackenbush. He emigrated to America with his parents and grew up in their home along the river to the north of the <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> then Albany <a href="../../map/map1676.html">stockade</a>.

<p>During the 1670s, he married <a href="../p/macpost456.html">Machtelt Post</a>. By 1695, the marriage had produced a number of children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>His family made their home on Quackenbush property just north of the <a href="../../citylimits.html">core city</a> of Albany. In 1683, he was identified as one of those living "beyond the North Gate." His household including six children was configured on the Albany census of <a href="../../census1697.html#054">1697</a>. Two years later, he joined his neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2139">pledging allegiance</a> to the king of England.

<p>After that, he sought out more rural locations for his residence. He had a farm with his brother north of the Mohawk in what became Clifton Park and was said to be interested in land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> and <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canistigone</a>.

<p>After 1708, his name dropped from Albany rolls. Johannes Quackenbush is said to have died at Canistigone in 1720.</p>
