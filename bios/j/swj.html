            <P>Although he owned an impressive <a href="#house">house and other 
              property</a> along the Albany waterfront, <A 
      href="#biography"><B>Sir William Johnson</B></a> (1715-1774), rarely if 
              ever spent more than a night in the colonial city. However, from 
              the 1740s until his death in 1774, he was a pivotal figure in early 
              Albany history.</p>
            <p>Frontier developer, businessman, Indian diplomat, military leader, 
              Masonic enthusiast, and all-around British official, William Johnson 
              was one of the most important people in colonial New York. His life 
              in America has been the subject of several <a href="#biographies">biographies</a> 
              and other historical treatments. The multi-volume <a href="../../sources.html#jp">edition 
              of his papers</a> provides an important and unparalleled window 
              on Albany's diverse functions during the middle of the eighteenth 
              century.</P>
            <p><a href="#wiki"><img src="../../images/jpg/wjmcil.jpg" align=right width=200 border=0 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Sir William from an engraving of a portrait by Mc Ilworth"></a>At the same time, Johnson was intimately involved with the Albany 
              business community, in Indian diplomacy - which frequently brought 
              him into conflict with the <a href="../../cia.html">Albany Indian 
              commissioners</a>, and in the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic 
              Lodge</a> where he sincerely cared about the lives of its diverse members. 
			  
           <p>From the time of the last colonial <a href="../../7yw.html">war</a>, 
              William Johnson was clearly visible as the leading <a href="../../friends.html">royalist</a> 
              living in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. Those with pro-British sympathies 
              and loyalties revolved around this important personage. His unexpected 
              death following a stroke in the summer of 1774 left Albany loyalists without an advocate 
              and in complete disarray. The <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">story</a> of the Revolutionary movement in the upriver region may have been markedly different had he lived.
            <p>Johnson's many-faceted and legendary life is much better explained in the sources cited below. In the <a href="../../inprog.html">future</a>, this page will better explain William Johnson in his early Albany context! </p>

<FONT size=-1>               <P> <A name=portrait></a>            Detail from a <b>portrait</b> of William Johnson by John Wollaston, Jr. painted about 1751. In the collection of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany 
            Institute of History and Art</a> - the repository of a number of Sir William-related items. Other likenesses of Johnson 
            are known to exist! 

<P><A name=house></a>Johnson's Albany <b>house</b> stood on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> and on the north side of State Street. He 
              purchased that <b>property</b> from <a href="../h/hholland8489.html">Henry Holland</a> during the winter 
              of 1748-49. Johnson called it "one of the best houses in Albany." 
              An undated notice (but probably of 1748-49 vintage) described a 
              two-story, brick building with good cellars, kitchen, and bleach 
              yard. It was valued at 1,500 pounds. Also included on the property 
              was a water lot with a frame house - valued at 500 pounds.The In 
              1759, Johnson purchased an adjacent lot from the city of Albany. 
              Johnson's Albany property was left to his son-in-law, Daniel Claus.
			  
<P><A name=biography></a>The life of <B>Sir William Johnson</B> is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 8489. With many Albany contacts, 
              he was a keen and long-time observer of the Albany scene. The <a href="../../sources.html#jp">multi-volume 
              edition of his papers</a> represents a major resource for early 
              Albany history.
			  
<P><A name=biographies></a>The most comprehensive printed <b>biographical 
              study</b> of Johnson is Milton W. Hamilton, <i>Sir William Johnson: 
              Colonial American, 1715-1763</i> (Port Washington, NY: 1976). Milton 
              Hamilton also was the last editor of the <a href="../../sources.html#jp"><i>Johnson 
              Papers</i></a>. Not to be missed is <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8J6Rjnt2NhIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=firekeeper+robert+moss&source=bl&ots=gFR8bbHLqL&sig=eZ__d6XuUV0y51lJPbm98GA7re0&hl=en&ei=t3_NTPH1B4WclgfSq-DjCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false">The Firekeeper</a>: A Narrative of the New York Frontier</i> By Robert Moss, published in 1995. The most modern treatment concerning Johnson can be found in

              Empire: The <a href="../../albanycongress.html">Albany Congress</a>
