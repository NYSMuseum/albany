<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Solomon Johnson</strong></a> lived in Albany for a time during the 1780s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. A <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IGsZAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA138&lpg=PA138&dq=%22solomon+johnson%22+albany&source=bl&ots=rws25sCIUT&sig=siGr0Jfdg1-FwlApUzgvkESWKKw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XtWzVJaDJOPasASk3YKYDA&ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20johnson%22%20albany&f=false">num</a>ber of same-named contemporaries dictate <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/z/o/r/Jeannie-Zortman-WA/GENE6-0008.html">caution</a> in the development of this profile. At this point, we will say that most likely he was from <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> - although he was not noted in <a href="../../fhg.html#nea"><i>NEA</i></a>. 

<p>In January 1776, a "Solomon Johnson" was among those militiamen from Marbletown, Ulster County who signed a petition to the "colonial congress." We expect to find a <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> service (or activity record) for the Albany resident. At this point, his name has not been found in the records of Albany's wartime <a href="../../coc.html">committees</a>. However, afterwards, this subject was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#sojo">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

      <p>By the end of the war, he was living in Albany. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1782">1782</a>, 
        he was elected constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 
        He was chosen again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1782">1786</a> but was 
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA281&lpg=PA281&dq=%22solomon+johnson%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0UkhoqJpvs&sig=sqG5eqECvXt5LjZ2ETqfYpiYW3k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kdSzVKDWBPi_sQTC7YD4Cg&ved=0CCUQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22solomon%20johnson%22%20albany&f=false">certified</a> 
        only after he appeared and "took the oath of allegiance." He was elected 
        in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1787">1787</a> (although he soon was replaced). 
      <p>In May 1788, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">City Records</a> reported that he had "removed to the Susquehanna."

<p>Only one Solomon Johnson was <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHKP-8NX">identified</a> on the first Federal census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. The household of that individual was configured (2 boys, 2 men, 3 females) in Canaan, Columbia County, New York.


<p>His <a href="http://www.pagenweb.org/~luzerne/patk/solomonjohnson.htm">will</a>, probated in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania in December 1808, left "to my worthy friend <a href="../c/elcrane.html">Elisha Crane</a> or his heirs all my property in Albany". That document noted that he was "sick and weak in body but Sound Mind Memory and Understanding." Also, no wife or children were identified. Perhaps, this <a href="http://wbwilkesbarreresidents1800.blogspot.com/">intriguing</a> characterization relates to the one-time Albany resident.
<p>With so many basic <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> still unanswered, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
