<strong>Maria Jay</strong></a> was born in February 1782. She was the middle daughter of Revolutionary leader <a href="jjay.html">John Jay</a> and his wife, Sara Van Brugh Livingston Jay. She was born in Spain where here father was the American ambassador. For a time, she was jokingly called "the little spaniard." Her early years also were spent in Paris and London in the company of famous diplomats including Benjamin Franklin - who remembered her fondly.

<p>Upon returning home to New York, Maria was sent to boarding school in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. But mostly, she lived in luxury in New York City. 

<p>Her parents raised their family in Albany while her father was governor of New York State (1795-1801).  In April 1801, she married <a href="../b/gbanyar7201.html">Goldsbrow Banyar, Jr.</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican Church. Their son and daughter were born in 1804 and 1805. But both children were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oHVLBRTz2T0C&pg=RA2-PA368&lpg=RA2-PA368&dq=%22maria+jay%22+death&source=web&ots=J6n7yU7JBd&sig=JgVyvmphjZopxhpBX5bgegCJ4FY&hl=en">short-lived</a>. 

<p>After a honeymoon trip to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qLGhXa9RSVEC&pg=RA2-PA547&lpg=RA2-PA547&dq=%22maria+jay%22+banyar&source=web&ots=EFtUAW249i&sig=1FU0gKQD2fmgkq6AChYYF70byWM&hl=en">visit</a> the Coopers (she was the long-time friend and correspondent of James Fenimore Cooper) in Cooperstown, the couple made their home in Albany. Their household at 62 North Pearl Street included Maria's elderly <a href="../b/gbanyar7200.html">father-in-law</a> and her sister Sarah Jay as well. 

<p>Goldsbrow Banyar, Jr. died in New York in June 1806. However, Maria remained in Albany - caring for the elder Goldsbrow until he died in 1815.

<p>In 1813, "M. Banyar" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA50,M1">listed</a> as one of the managers of the "Albany Ladies Society."

<p>Afterwards, she returned to her family - probably living at Katonah from about 1818 until her father's death in 1829.

<p>Maria Jay Banyar died in New York City in November 1856 at the age of seventy-five.
