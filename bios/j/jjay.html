        leader, statesman, and jurist <a href="#sources"><b>John Jay</b></a> lived in a rented <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=oHVLBRTz2T0C&pg=RA2-PA357&lpg=RA2-PA357&dq=%22john+jay%22+albany&source=web&ots=J6n3BU2Pwi&sig=QqPj2H38Adx15dfRLOlwldl6P6Q">res</a>idence on <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> while serving as Governor of New York State from 1795 to 1801. He also provided interesting commentary when he was <a href="http://www.familytales.org/dbDisplay.php?id=ltr_joj4012&city=albany">in</a> Albany on public business during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independance. </p>

<p>John Jay was born in New York in 1745. He died in at his home in Westchester County in 1829. In 1774, he married Sara Van Brugh Livingston - daughter of the <a href="../../bios/l/wmlivingston.html">Albany-born</a> governor of New Jersey and a descendant of Albany founder <a href="../../bios/l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a>. The marriage produced seven children. His daughter, <a href="majay2592.html">Maria</a>, married Goldsbrow Banyar, Jr. and remained in Albany long after her parents had left. He was the brother of one-time Albany minister's wife <a href="ejay1065.html">Eva Jay Munro</a> and mentor of her son, Peter Jay Munro.

<p>Not knowing if the legislature would remain in Albany , he first rented two rooms while his family remained in New York. But, soon, he acquired and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XP9OXSEvvkYC&pg=RA1-PA443&lpg">resided</a> at 60 State Street in a home formerly belonging to <a href="../../bios\c\jacaldwell7509.html">James Caldwell</a>. In 
<a href="../../census1800.html#jjay">1800</a>, the census revealed that his household consisted eight family members and five slaves.

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay#Slavery">Slave Manumission Act of 1799</a> was passed during his term of office.  Although a slaveholder himself, John Jay had been a leading figure of the anti-slavery movement in New York State.

<p>Jay rarely (if ever) came to Albany before being elected governor. In 1801, he retired to a family farm in Bedford, Westchester County. Perhaps, he never returned to the "State Capital" - dying in Westchester in May 1829. </p>
