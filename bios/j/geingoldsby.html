<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>George Ingoldsby</strong></a> was the son of English officer, official, and one-time Albany commander <a href="riingoldsby.html">Richard Ingoldsby</a> and his wife (and principal heir), Mary. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Poss</a>ibly named for a famous  grandfather, he probably came to America with his father in 1690. However, we seek definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and specific path to Albany. A number of same-named contemporaries complicate that ambition.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1698ric.html">1698</a>, he probably was an adult when his name appeared on the roster of his father's Albany-based garrison <a href="../../garrison.html">company</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#gein">1699</a>, he was among 180 men in Albany County who signed a loyalty oath to the Protestant king of England.

<p> Over several decades, he could be characterized as a royal adherent living in New York and/or New Jersey. In July 1706, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZQ0bAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=%22george+ingoldesby%22&source=bl&ots=hqLBs3es8x&sig=zsje8b8p44RSE70IfUdGDW1TFlw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ksx0U56PKem1sASMqYHwCA&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22george%20ingoldesby%22&f=false">testified</a> regarding political affairs and landholding in those colonies. At that time, he was referred to as a "gentleman" and "Late of the province of New Jersey." 

<p>In August 1714, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willriingolds.html">will</a> filed by his father. However, he was to receive only a token part of Richard's considerable estate.

      <p>During the 1720s he was a lieutenant under his uncle <a href="../s/lasymes.html">Lancaster 
        Symes</a> in one of the Independent Companies. During the first decades 
        of the century, this officer served the crown in a number of capacities 
        and places beyond Albany. We cannot chronicle that <a href="../../na/na.html">service</a>. 
      <p>During the 1730s, he was among those royal favorites who were granted frontier <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>. In July <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iOpRAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1029&lpg=PA1029&dq=%22george+ingoldsby%22+albany&source=bl&ots=wJU6k6cjo2&sig=khEnCWoWauXtRoZ078lNl5yoX3k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4Nh4U6vtKZTtoAShloL4CQ&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22george%20ingoldsby%22%20albany&f=false">1737</a>, he was among those granted a patent for 10,000 acres on the south side of the Mohawk between Schenectady and Schoharie. Later, those lands are <a href="http://genealogytrails.com/ny//schenectady/history_princetown.html">said to have become</a> the property of attorney <a href="../c/wmcorry.html">William Corry</a>. Ingoldsby also administered the real estate (in the so-called "Mary Ingoldsby Patent" in Ulster County) held by his <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/master/gdc/scdser01/200401/books_on_film_project/loc06/20060524001ni.pdf">mother</a>.

      <p>We <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now still expecting to incorporate 
        more qualitative information on the one-time garrison soldier named George 
        Ingoldsby. </p>
