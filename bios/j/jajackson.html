<P>A number of individuals named <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jack Jackson</strong></a> lived (sometimes at the same time) in the city of Albany during its <a href="../../criteria.html">initial         stages</a> of settlement and development. This sketch/essay introduces the <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> to our social mosaic and begins to profile the life of the individual who was listed as "Jack Jackum" on the Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#jaja">census in 1790</a>. Keeping in mind that more than one similarly named contemporary individual was at-risk, we still might infer that he was a <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free person of color</a> whose nine-person household was in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>The <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzle</a> that is his story begins for us in 1779 when the Albany assessment roll taken in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jaja">March</a> lists his modestly valued house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. However a few months later in October another <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">tax list</a> individually valued the property of "Old Jack" and "Young Jack"  at five dollars each with the younger appearing below "Old Jack." [The five dollars seems a modest sum considering that a prominent and loyal <a href="../c/jacuyler539.html">neighbor</a> was assessed $3,000 on the same list.] However, a decade later in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1074">1788</a>, only the household of "Widow Jackson & Son" appeared on the citywide assessment roll. In 1800, two separate individuals named "Jack Jackson" were listed on the Albany census in the <a href="../../census1800.html#jajafn">first</a> (Jack Jackson a free Negro with five free people in his household) and <a href="../../census1800.html#jajafm">second</a> ("John Jackson a free man" with 3 white men and six other free people in his household) wards. At this point, we surmise that "Jack Jackson" was the husband/consort of Afro Albanian matriarch <a href="djackson1074.html">Dinnah Jackson</a>.

<p>However, other <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzlements</a> give us pause! Thinking out loud yet cautious because of multiple potential subjects, we feel it prudent to <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> from this profile of Albany's first "Jack Jackson."</p>
