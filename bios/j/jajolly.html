<strong>James Jolly</strong></a> probably was born before 1756. He was the son of Albany-<a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">area</a> innkeeper <a href="hujolly1171.html">Hugh Jolly</a>. He was left a monetary bequest  but otherwise excluded in the <a href="http://genealogytrails.com/ny/albany/HughJolly.txt">will</a> filed by his father in 1802.

<p>During the 1770s, he was listed as a private in the third regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a> commanded by <a href="../s/phschuyler1751.html">Philip P. Schuyler</a>. In July 1781, he was identified as a farmer of the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>est District of Rensselaerswyck when he <a href="../../cddc.html">posted</a>  a hundred pound bond for Anne Conning, who was charged with harboring robbers. Otherwise, we seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities.

<p>James Jolly appears on the community landscape with the census of <a href="../../census1790.html#jjol">1790</a> when his first ward household included three members. Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">rolls</a> showed that his modest house, lot, and holdings were located on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. In <a href="../../census1800.html#jjol">1800</a>, his home included three children under ten, a young man, in addition to the heads of the this Jolly family.


<p>His wife was named Anna. During the 1790s, their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran Church</a>.

<p>In 1800 and 1801, he paid twelve dollars for a tavern owner's license. In 1800, he was identified as a fireman in a city fire company.

<p>After being named in his father's will in 1802, James Jolly was no longer included in the early Albany record. We seek information on his later life and passing.
