      <P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Richard Ingoldsby</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">often</a> 
        Ingoldesby) was a career <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Ingoldesby">British 
        officer and official</a> who was sent to New York in 1690. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZQyVinBxMRMC&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%22Col+Richard.+Ingoldsby%22+albany&source=bl&ots=HAx4yX4BOE&sig=YVptnysJgd9922H_ONAf4dNcEVU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H_1PU_y5FMevyATu_oK4Bg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22Col%20Richard.%20Ingoldsby%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> 
        to have served previously in Holland and Ireland. We seek information 
        on his precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and specific 
        path to Albany. A number of <a href="#geo">same-named</a> predecessors 
        were <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22richard+ingoldsby%22">prominent</a> 
        in British military and imperial affairs during the seventeenth century. 
      <p>He is said to have arrived in New York with two companies of soldiers in January 1691. Among his first actions was the <a href="#beg">removal</a> of the insurgent <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a> from power. By the end of the year, he had sent a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=Ingoldsby+albany&source=bl&ots=cNtX4Ed8QP&sig=wK_z8gtZ4wSsNSDeFrPTQRk-SS8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wplSU8GNKISNyATkmIGQAw&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&q=Ingoldsby%20albany&f=false">descriptive report</a> on conditions at Albany and elsewhere to England. He later became acting governor of the provinces of New York and New Jersey. His career in America over three decades is substantial and complex. It also is beyond the scope of this study. Sometimes conflicting information on same-named contemporaries further <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ingoldsby,_Richard_(d.1712)_(DNB00)">complicates</a> the assignment of qualitative information on his life. This sketch organizes information on the individual (an officer called captain, major, and colonel) who was in Albany at different times during the 1690s. His <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA999&lpg=RA12-PA999&dq=%22ingoldesby&source=web&ots=hq0MrgbxF_&sig=7sibr8RsHv3rSzUurCrKg6LWnGQ#v=onepage&q=%22ingoldesby&f=false">various commands</a> (particularly of a <a href="../../lists/list1698ric.html">company</a> of grenadiers) included a number of Albany residents. Our <a href="#sh">focus</a> will be on his time in Albany.

<p>In September 1693, city council records called him "<a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Annals-of-Albany-Volume-2/974477/271">Coll Richd. Ingoldsby</a>" while referring to him as "commander of this place" when he joined "Maj." <a href="../s/pischuyler61.html#council">Pieter Schuyler</a>, then a member of the provincial Council, in submitting an order of the Council for improving the city's defenses. In March 1695, he unsuccessfully <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Annals-of-Albany-Volume-2/974477/283">attempted to order</a> the mayor to quarter one "Lieutenant Shanks" on the town. During the 1690s, his various official capacities revealed a number of connections to the operations of <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> at the fort and in their forays against the French. However, after that, his activities mostly emanated from a non Albany base.

<p>His wife was named Mary. In 1700, she was among those admitted to the of the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch church</a>. During the early 1700s, soldiers in his company of Grenadiers and Mary as well were referenced in the church records. An adult <a href="geingoldsby.html">son</a> and married daughter were living in 1714. Thus, he probably was married prior to emigrating to New York. 

<p>Ingoldsby's time in Albany appears to be confined mostly to the 1690s. By the 1700s, he was living on Manhattan and serving the provincial government in a number of official capacities.  At least in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA230&lpg=PA277&dq=ingoldsby&source=bl&ots=Fkue_WocQk&sig=9ygh9_dGFv5Svc5OGir9qfRWM3U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VxxZU6XTNvLHsAT24oCIBQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=ingoldsby&f=false">1709</a>, he returned to Albany presumably in his executive capacity to meet/treat with the Indians. 

<p>Richard Ingoldsby, "Esq." filed a <a href="../../wills/willriingolds.html">will</a> in August of 1714. At that time he was at "Stillwater in Albany County." It named his "beloved wife" and then his two children as his heirs. Ingoldsby had died by 1719 when the will passed probate in New York.</p>

<p><a name=geo></a>One earlier Richard was the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ingoldsby,_Richard_(d.1712)_(DNB00)">son</a> of George Ingoldsby - the given name of this individual's son who served in his father's company and was living in America in 1714.

<p><a name=beg></a>Most historical <a href="../../res/ts.html">mentions</a> of Ingoldsby only allude to his "removal" of Leisler. However, this <a href="http://slic.njstatelib.org/slic_files/imported/NJ_Information/Digital_Collections/Governors_of_New_Jersey/GINGO.pdf">sketch</a> by historian Eugene R. Sheridan further develops his biography.
 
<p><a name=sh></a>The printed <a href="../../sources.html#sh">Annual Reports</a> of the State Historian provide substantial information on varied leadership activities of this royal official. At this point, we have yet not followed them!
