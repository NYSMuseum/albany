      <P>The Albany <a href="../g/gerritse.html">ma</a>triarch known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously as  <a href="#sources"><b>Anna Jans</b></a> is <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Janse-19">said</a> to have been born in Amsterdam, Holland about 1645. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a> she was the daughter of Gerrit and Anna Ryerse.</p>
      <p>In April 1665, she married <a href="../g/gerygerr6020.html">Gerrit Ryerse</a> 
        in New York City. The marriage produced several children who became Albany 
        residents. She was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>.</p>
<p>Known in the community as "Anna Gerritse," her family lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>Gerrit Ryerse filed a <a href="../../wills/willgerygerr.html">will</a> in February 1694. It named Anna sole executrix and left her his house and orchard outside Albany's north gate - and also all remaining assets. Although Gerrit's will was not probated until 1713, he probably died within a few years of its filing.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#169">1697</a>, she was called "Wedewe" and identified as the head of her household that was located next to that of her son <a href="../g/jagerr6008.html">Jan</a>. Her name appeared on subsequent third ward <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6472">assessment rolls</a> which taxed her property comparable to that of prosperous merchants.</p>
		
<p>Anna Jans Ryers Gerrits filed her own <a href="../../wills/willanjrgerr.html">will</a> in May 1712. She left her entire estate to her four living children. It passed probate in March 1713.</p>
