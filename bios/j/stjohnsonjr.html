<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Stephen W. Johnson, Jr.</strong></a> was <a href=http://genforum.genealogy.com/johnson/messages/26457.html"">said</a> to have been born in November 1796. He was the son of <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> Albany residents <a href="stjohnson.html">Stephen W </a> and Martha Smith Johnson. Thus, he would have been born in Albany. We seek more definitive information regarding his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>. However, if he was the son of his namesake, he probably was born in New England,.

<p>Perhaps, his name first appeared on the <a href="../../cbr.html">community landscape</a> when he was identified as a <a href="http://www.bookbindersmuseum.com/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=viewlink&link_id=1424&Itemid=0">bookbinder</a> in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> for 1818. He also was a publisher and bookseller of some <a href="http://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/ocm16447491">note</a>. Probably coincidentally, several scientific publications issuing from Albany about 1830 credited [a different] "S. W. Johnson" as translator.

<p>On October 18, 1828, an Albany newspaper reported (<a href="http://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany09munsuoft#page/175/mode/2up">p. 175</a>) that "S. W. Johnson, whose bookstore was for several years on the corner of South Market and Beaver streets in a one story building, where the Atlas office now stands, removed to 514 South Market street, near the Eagle tavern, where he carried on binding also, his regular business."

<p>Perhaps this individual was the SWJ (and not his father) who was appointed "city gauger" beginning in 1819 (with the common address of 18 Van Schaick).

<p>At this point, we are not willing to separate this individual from his namesake in the assignment of qualitative information. In short, at least two SWJs lived in early nineteenth century Albany.

<p>End of life information is available but not conclusive. With so many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> and loose end regarding the life of Albany resident Stephen W. Johnson, Jr., we prudently move on for now! </p>
