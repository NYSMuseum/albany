<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter Jones</strong></a> probably was born during the 1720s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In October 1748, Peter Jones was living in Albany when he married Albany native <a href="../w/abwinne2804.html">Abigail Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1768, six sons had been christened in the church where he had witnessed baptisms prior to his marriage. However, most of his sons did not survive childhood.

<p>This Peter Jones was an Albany resident for several decades - at least from <a href="../../org/cc.html#1742">1742</a>, when he was appointed constable for the first ward, until as late as March 1769, when his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=%22jones&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22jones&f=false">account</a> for two shillings, nine pence was paid by the city government.

<p>Jones was a <a href="../../census1756.html#195">cooper</a> and was appointed to build stockades for the city in August 1743. He was named firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1747">1747</a> and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1765">1765</a>. However, he refused the last appointment claiming he was too busy and was replaced. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#7659">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. In 1765, he was identified as a cooper and was a potential juror in a probate case. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">mid-1760s</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property was assessed modestly.

<p>An Albany resident for more than three decades, Peter Jones probably was dead or had left Albany by the 1770s. We seek information on his later life and passing. </p>
