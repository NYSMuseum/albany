<P>Based on subsequent and <a href="../../res/irs.html">eph</a>emeral information, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Joseph Jewel</strong></a> (Jewell) was born before 1766 and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XUpkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=jewell+%22american+ancestry%22&source=bl&ots=dNWGJA78Xo&sig=WpZ-hUFvG0UpcuOHiuz_A1nmu4w&hl=en&ei=_7XVS-FEw4HyBvmcicsP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">possibly</a> in 1759. He may have been from New Hampshire - his family having emigrated to Boston in 1639. However, his name is absent from Jonathan Tenney's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=goRAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22new+england+in++albany%22&source=bl&ots=Wm23R1Waxf&sig=fv33sMtrwabGeYkOj1FX_fHGjqI&hl=en&ei=j73VS8zmCMSqlAeO6IS7CQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=jewett&f=false"><i>New England in Albany</i></a>.

<p>We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on his activities during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. A Lieutenant Joseph Jewell <a href="../../guide/histres.html#military">served</a> in the third regiment of the Orange County militia.

<p>In February 1783, he (Joseph Juwell) married <a href="../../res/sp.html">N</a>ancy Dennels (perhaps Daniels) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their son, "Volkert Dawson" Jewel, was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/aluth002.htm">christened</a> at the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> in Albany in August 1786. Another son, <a href="jejewel.html">Jeremiah</a>, became an Albany resident.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#joje">1788</a>, his house and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> were valued on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#joje">1790</a>, his household included six people.

<p>His name does not seem to appear on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, his Albany household included an older couple and three young people. 

<p>Joseph Jewel seems to have died in 1812. The year following, his widow Hannah was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=%22jewel&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22jewel&f=false">listed</a> in the first city directory at 86 Fox Street. </p>
 
<p>Joseoph Jewell's widow, Ann, may have <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany09munsuoft#page/254/mode/2up">died</a> from Cholera in August 1832 at the age of eighty-one.

<p><dd>In 1805, Reverend Joseph Jewel commenced a Methodist <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/ontario/churches/victorchurch.htm">mission</a> in Ontario County, New York. Probably another same-named individual was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GSkAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=calomel+%22joseph+jewel%22&source=bl&ots=b4pVzvgxH9&sig=TP7R0AKzNg0uivNyOpgA6flI7y8&hl=en&ei=0K7VS4iXHcH78Aa8mKkO&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CBEQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=calomel%20%22joseph%20jewel%22&f=false">pharmocological innovator</a> during the early 1800s. A number of Revolutionary War senarios bear investigation as well. A different namesake also lived in <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/First_Presbyterian_Church_of_Durham_Early_Members.htm">Greene County</a>.</p>
