He may have been Albany's first "millionaire." He was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailieborough">born</a> in Northern <a href="../irish.html">Ir</a>eland in 1771 - the son of tenant farmers William and Susan Mc Cartney James.</p>
	  
<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, he 
        came to America with a "small sum of money" in 1789. By 1793, he was a 
        clerk in the Albany dry goods store of <a href="../r/jorobison422.html">John 
        Robison</a>. In 1795, he opened his own store. In 1798, he built a tobacco 
        factory near the Albany waterfront. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2136">1800</a> 
        his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household included only 
        one child. Immediately successful, he soon began to acquire <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        property</a> in all parts of the booming city. Over the next two decades, 
        his businesses had a number of partners.</p>
      <P>In 1796, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AVG16f2b91sC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18">married</a> 
        Albany native <a href="../t/eltillman2133.html">Elizabeth Tillman</a>. 
        After her death, he married Mary Ann Connolly from Ireland at the <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Ca</a>ughnawaga 
        Dutch church. That marriage may have produced only one child. Following 
        her death, in 1803 he took for his third wife Catherine Barber (no relation 
        to <a href="../b/jobarber7202.html">John Barber</a> the publisher). The union brought them ten children - eight of whom survived. In 1802, "William of Albany" became 
        a <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> American citizen.</p>
      <p>By <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1815</a>, his store at 1 Green Street 
        (corner of State) was an Albany landmark. He had another store on the 
        dock. He served on the boards of a number of community organizations, 
        was an advocate of the Erie Canal, and was involved in the salt business 
        - perhaps leading to the establishment of the saltworks at Jamesville.</p>
      <p>He retired from business before 1820 - turning operations over to his 
        son, Robert, who died in 1821 at the age of twenty-four. But the father 
        continued to acquire and trade in city <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        estate</a> for the remainder of his life. At the time of his death, he 
        owned many parcels of Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">property</a> 
        - probably more than any of his contemporaries.</p>
<p>William James died in December 1832, a few days shy of his sixty-first birthday! His will passed probate in January 1833. <a href="../../streets.html#middle">James Street</a> - formerly Middle Alley, was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/carljohnson/79063355">named</a> for him.
