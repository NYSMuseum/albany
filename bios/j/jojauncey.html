<strong>John Jauncey</strong></a> was born during the 1760s. He was the only son born to the marriage of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vwsrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22john+jauncey%22&source=bl&ots=HlcujSarRv&sig=Z8gweoUGISDpcq0yN3kHwq3Gb8c&hl=en&ei=Lf3ISY6yNYy-M_aV4OsD&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPA5,M1">John Jauncey, Jr. </a> and Elizabeth Hicks. His <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/service/gdc/scd0001/2007/20070601050ja/20070601050ja.pdf">grandfather</a> was a ship captain and his mariner father died at sea in 1767. His mother was the daughter of a prominent Hempstead (Long Island) family. 

<p>We seek information on his earlier life - prior to arriving in Albany. We are careful to avoid confusing this individual with same-named contemporaries. He probably was the kinsman of <a href="http://personal.nbnet.nb.ca/halew/NY-Attainder.html">condemned</a> Tory <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vwsrAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=%22james+jauncey%22&source=bl&ots=Hlcuj_7qRA&sig=z9DJIlteTiRHEa5bwemMDGMxBDQ&hl=en&ei=lynKSaSAKYSNtgfLhPShAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result">James Jauncey</a>.

<p>In July 1789, this John Jauncey married Elsie Cuyler (possibly Kugler and not a member of the prominent Albany <a href="../c/cuyler.html">C</a>uyler family) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their first child was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church in April 1790. John Jauncey was confirmed at St. Peters in September 1791. By 1807, the marriage had produced a number of children.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#joja">1788</a>, the firm of "Jauncey & Given" shared a riverside property. The census in <a href="../../census1790.html#joja">1790</a> noted three females and a slave in his household. In <a href="../../census1800.html#joja">1800</a>, his third ward home included eight residents and four slaves. Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his diverse and substantial holdings in Albany were valued on city assessment rolls. His lots, wharves, store, and house "he occupies" - all in the third ward, were accorded more than moderate assessments. He held the waterfront properties as "Jauncey & Hoyt." He was an active participant in the Albany-based <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market.

<p>In December 1790, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> noted that he was a merchant (dealing in glassware) and was located at 23 Market Street. Subsequent freeholder and jury <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">lists</a> identified him as merchant based in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.  


<p>In 1792, he was among the trustees <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=33s4AAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA390&lpg=RA1-PA390&dq=%22john+jauncey%22+albany&source=bl&ots=6irpMcpNtT&sig=VovvOmJ41dlwg1lMsXJoKBkEtXs&hl=en&ei=YQrJSZS9GZawMoWsrKIP&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result">petitioning</a> for incorporation of the Albany Library. In <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#joja">1794</a>, he was among the notables who subscribed in support of Union College.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1793">1793</a>, he was elected assistant alderman. In 1802, he was elected alderman for the second ward.

<p>After the early 1800s, his name seems to be missing from the community record. However, between 1818 and 1820, he was identified as an "auctioneer" and listed with John Jauncey, Jr. in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> at 63 Washington Street and his store at 99 State. The Albany census  in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1820</a>, listed three males and five females in his household.  After that, his name no longer appeared on Albany rolls.
 
<p>John Jauncey died in Auburn in 1831. His widow is said to have survived him by many years.
