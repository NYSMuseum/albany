<a href="#sources">
<strong>Anneke Jans</strong></a> is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in Norway in 1605. Her parents probably were Johannes and Tryntie! Her mother was a mid-wife. She took the name "Anneke Jans" - and it has persisted historically.  She was perhaps the most "<a href="#sources">legendary</a>" woman to live in early Albany!</p>

<p>Her first husband was Roeloff Jansen whom she married in April 1623. She was eighteen. He was twenty-three. Following the birth of their first three children, they emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> in 1630. Roeloff was a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farmer and official who died in 1636. In 1638, she married Dominie <a href="../b/evbogardus.html">Everhardus Bogardus</a> in New Amsterdam. The marriage produced eight or nine children before his accidental death at sea in 1647. Several of her children established prominent families of their own.

<p>Although she controlled substantial assets in and around Manhattan, Anneke Jans gathered her family and settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. She lived in a landmark house on the north side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> and Middle Alley. 

.

<p>Stating that she was "sick in bed," Anneke Jans filed a <a href="../../wills/willanjans.html">will</a> in January 1663. It described her family and  resources. She died in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> in February 1663.</p>
