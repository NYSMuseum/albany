<!-- Start Main Content -->
<P>According to later accounts, <a href="#sources"><strong>George Joyce</strong></a> <a href="../../res/sp.html">(</a>Joice<a href="../../res/sp.html">)</a> was born about 1753.

<p>In his twenties during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, we seek information on his wartime activities. However. afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#gj">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In 1787, his accounts were paid from the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> treasury.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#gj">1788</a>, his first ward holdings were valued modestly. The first census in <a href="../../census1790.html#gj">1790</a> showed his household with two men and four females. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#gj">later</a>,  the census showed five children, another adult man, and a slightly younger woman as living in his household.

<p>His wife was known as "Julia Filia" and their child was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/aluth004.htm">baptized</a> in the Albany Lutheran church in December 1788. We seek information on his wife and children.

<p>A number of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">sources</a> identified him as a cartman. Assessment rolls from 1799 on valued his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in the second ward. Beginning with the first directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=%22joyce,+george%22&source=bl&ots=2hLxOZXx9A&sig=1u1u_V4JYutjq_trCGqkeuehJ04&hl=en&ei=JzFfSpOOH46itgfMkZzgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4">1813</a>, he was called a cartman with the address of 1 North Pearl Street - an address placing him near the city's northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">boundary</a>.



<p>Seventy-eight-year old George Joyce died in Albany in July 1831. At that time, his residence was near the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> waterfront at the corner of Lumber and Montgomery Streets. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in November.</p>
