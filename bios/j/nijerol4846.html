<P>Found under a number of <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>ellings, <a href="#sources"><strong>Nicholas Jeroleman</strong></a> probably was born before 1750. 
        We expect to be able to connect this individual to the family that came 
        to America during the 1600s and <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/1998-07/0900458513">settled</a> 
        in New York and New Jersey. 
      <p>In May 1770, Nicholas "Yeraleman" married bricklayer's daughter <a href="../w/jawaldron663.html">Jannetje 
        Waldron</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At 
        that time, they both were identified as residents of "this city." By 1789, 
        nine children had been christened at the Albany church where both parents 
        were occasional baptism sponsors. 
      <p>In 1775 and '76, he contributed to and performed services for the Albany 
        <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. In 1778, he 
        was appointed a captain in an Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">regiment</a> 
        by the New York State Council of Appointment.
		
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4846">1779</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property was valued for taxes. In July <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA328&lpg=PA328&dq=%22nicholas+jeroleman%22&source=bl&ots=jv9L_Eq9kW&sig=f-aBUT2yAfrpchORwCURQ6sGx48&hl=en&ei=fviVTIqWMoP6lwf-zIGpCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20jeroleman%22&f=false">1781</a>, his account for one pound was ordered paid from the city treasury.
<p>After the war, he ("Yoralimor") was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4846">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#4846">Masonic Lodge</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4846">1788</a>, his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside 
        property was accorded a moderate assessment. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4846">1790</a>, 
        his <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet household, with 
        eleven family members, was configured on the first Federal census. 
      <p>By <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=%22nicholas+jeroleman%22&source=bl&ots=4QNk3CmW1P&sig=xTi945fpUSBkxLfxglEZDjMPb30&hl=en&ei=fviVTIqWMoP6lwf-zIGpCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20jeroleman%22&f=false">1813</a>, 
        he had sold a piece of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> 
        in Bethlehem. 
      <p>Nicholas Jeroleman was last heard from in March 1815 in a land sale involving 
        the Waldrons. HIs son and namesake became a resident of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>.</p>
