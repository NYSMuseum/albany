<P>Connecticut native <a href="#sources"><b>Bristol Johnson</b></a> was an <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro-Albanian</a> skipper and a veteran of the American Revolution.</p>


<p>He was born into slavery in Middletown, Connecticut about 1755. He <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> as a private in the first regiment of the Connecticut Line in the American Revolutionary army. A pension application later described his service.</p>

<p>In January 1781, he was emancipated (freed) by Joseph Taylor of Colchester, Connecticut. Shortly thereafter, he married  <a href="#vera">Elvira (Vera) Skinner</a> in Colchester and began to raise a family.</p>

<p>About 1795, he left Elvira and four children in Colchester and moved in with another woman in Middletown. About 1798, he left her behind and moved to 
<a href="../../art/art-jls.html">Albany</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#ad"><img src="../../images/jpg/ad1818johnson.jpg" align=right vspace=4 hspace=4 border=0width=300 alt="Bristol Johnson's residence in 1818"></a>In 
        May 1810, he purchased a parcel on the north side of Bassett Street in 
        the heart of an emerging neighborhood of newcomers called the <a href="../s/sschuyler8492.html#southend">South 
        End</a>! His residence near the corner of South Pearl Street was noted 
        in city directories for the next two decades. He was among a number of 
        Afro-Albanian river people including <a href="../s/sschuyler8492.html">Captain 
        Samuel Schuyler</a> who lived near that intersection. Skipper John Johnson, 
        who lived with Bristol, may have been his son or brother!</p> 

<p>In 1813, he appeared before the Albany court where witnesses testified that the fifty-eight-year-old Johnson was a free man and a freeholder within the county of Albany. First identified as a "waterman," he was subsequently referred to as a "skipper."</p>

<p>Bristol Johnson died in Albany in April 1830!</p>
