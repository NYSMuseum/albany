<P>Sometimes called 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Hugh Jolly, Sr.</strong></a>, this individual was born before 1720. He probably was a native of Scotland.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#326">1756</a>, a residence was described on a census of Albany houses made by the British army. It identified the householder as "Jolly Irish Man, sells liquor."

<p>During the 1760s, however, his name has not been found among the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">more  obvious</a>  community-based records for Albany and its environs. 

<p>His wife was named Eleanor.  His <a href="jajolly.html">son</a> became an Albany resident. A daughter married one of the Robert Henrys. However, his name is absent from the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> years, he ran an inn or tavern that was located two miles below Albany. He often was under <a href="../../coc.html">suspicion</a> of disloyalty and then was charged with permitting "tories and negroes . . . with congregating at his place and plotting to burn the city." He was confined during 1777 and 1778. However, afterwards, he was accorded a bounty right in conjunction with the third regiment (Bethlehem) of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>In 1785, his account was paid from the city <a href="../../corporation.html#treas">treasury</a>.
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1171">1790</a>, the census identified him as a resident of Watervliet. A decade later, his household was configured on the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> census with two adolescent girls, an older woman and five men and boys.

<p>Hugh Jolly filed a will in August 1802. He died in October 1804 in his eighty-fifth year. He was buried in the <a href="http://www.townofbethlehem.org/pages/History/historyArticlesHistoricalCruise.asp">Nicoll-Sill cemetery</a> in Bethlehem. His <a href="http://genealogytrails.com/ny/albany/HughJolly.txt">will</a> left a large bequest to his widow and provided for his three sons and three daughters. The will passed probate in Albany County in February 1805.
