      <P><strong>O</strong>ngoing conversations and our attempts to define and 
        clarify use of this term, has led us to embark on the following discussion: 
      <p>Over the years, the term "Indians" has been appropriated for use in virtually 
        all modes of literary expression. A basic google.com search of the word 
        "<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=indians">Indian</a>" quickly yields 
        at least a billion and a half matches with the vast majority of the references 
        being to the inhabitants of Indian subcontinent and the East and West 
        Indies. When used to represent the "Native People of North America" or 
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">The 
        Indigenous peoples of the Americas</a>," the word "indians" returns almost 
        two million google.com matches. A decade and a half into our Internet 
        based <a href="../index.html">exposition</a> of the story of the People 
        of colonial Albany and their world, we have employed the term more than 
        a hundred times. At the same time, we prefer and have used "Native peoples" 
        or "Native Americans" to describe the people first encountered by the 
        European colonists and their descendants. 
      <p>Mostly, the Colonial Albany Project has employed such descriptive terms 
        in the <a href="../res/context.html">context</a> of our expositions relating 
        to the so-called <a href="../furtrade.html">Fur Trade</a>. 
      <p>At this point, we do not feel we can add to this topic in a meaningful 
        and appropriate way. Thus, we <a href="staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> 
        for now. Please let us know if that statement is incorrect and/or puzzling 
        and /how we can do better! </p>
