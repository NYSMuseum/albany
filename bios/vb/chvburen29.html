<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Christina Van Buren</strong></a> was born in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in 1644. She was the daughter of Cornelis Maas and Cathalina Martens Van Buren. 
        Her parents both died on the same day in 1648. She was raised on the farm 
        of Teunis Dirckse and Cornelia <a href="../vv/vvechten.html">Van Vechten</a> of <A href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html#paps">Papskanee 
        Island</a>.</P>

<P>At nineteen, this orphaned farm girl married twenty-four-year-old <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck 
        Wesselse</a> - a successful fur trader and a major figure in early Albany 
        history. The couple moved into the Anneke Jans house on lower <a href="../../streets.html">State 
        Street</a>, joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>, 
        and began to raise a family.</p>

<p>A young bride, Christina gave <a href="../t/tbvb.html">birth</a> to thirteen children between 1664 and 1689. Eleven of her children survived to marriage age - making her the  matriarch of a large extended family over her long life.</p>

<p>Dirck Wesselse acquired extensive acreage across the upriver region. After 1700, these Ten Broecks retired to their estate or <i>Bouwerie</i> along the Roeloff Jansen Kil on Livingston Manor.</P>

      <P>On the death of Dirck Wesselse in 1717, his "well-beloved" Christina <a href="../../wills/willdwtbroeck32.html">inherited</a> the bulk of her husband's vast estate with the proviso that she remain a widow and not sell any of the real property to strangers. In 1718, the now seventy-four-year-old widow appointed her sons, Wessel and Johannes, and son-in-law Johannes Cuyler as her attornies to administer the estate in accordance with the wishes of her late husband.</p>

<p>Christina Ten Broeck then went to live in their old Albany house under the care of the family of her son <a href="../t/jotbroeck52.html">Johannes Ten Broeck</a>. She died in November 1729 at age 85 and was buried in the church cemetery. By that time, <a href="../bioindex.html#t">several</a> younger "Christina Ten Broecks" had been named in her honor.</P>
