      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Obadiah Van Benthuysen</strong></a> was 
        born in June 1744. He was the second of six sons of <a href="japvbt5344.html">Jacobus</a> 
        and <a href="../c/sacooper506.html">Sara Cooper</a> Van Benthuysen. He 
        grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a> he was appointed constable 
        for the first ward. In 1770, he was made a member of the Albany night 
        watch. 
      <p>About 1768, he married <a href="../r/anrumney.html">Anna/Hannah Rumney</a>. 
        By 1791, that marriage had produced ten children who were christened at 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
      <p>In 1769, he was named as an heir among six sons and two daughters in 
        the <a href="../../wills/willjapvbt5344.html">will</a> filed by his father. 
        He also was named co-executor of the estate.

<p>During the 1760s, his name appeared on the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#5357">rosters</a> of Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> companies. A decade later, he is <a href="http://threerivershms.com/nyrevsundry.htm">said to have served</a> the Revolutionary cause although his name was not included on the obvious Albany <a href="../../or/or-as.html">service</a> lists. 
<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#506">1779</a>, his widowed mother had taken over as the head of this Van Benthuysen household. In 1788, his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5357">house</a> and holdings were valued on the first ward assessment roll. In 1790, perhaps his growing family was included within the <a href="../../census1790.html#506">household</a> of his widowed mother. But by <a href="../../census1800.html#5357">1800</a>, he was identified as the head of a first ward household.

<p>At this point, we have not connected this Albany mainliner him with specific <a href="../../econ/comec.html">economic</a> activities. However, his 
        name did appear in Albany <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#5357">ac</a>counts 
      <p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA92,M1">1813</a>, 
        he was listed in the city directory at 25 <a href="../../streets.html#division">Division</a> 
        Street. Another Obadiah (R.) was the more famous publisher and bookbinder. 
      <p>Obadiah Van Benthuysen was dead by 1817 when his widow was listed as 
        the head of their Division Street home. He had lived about seventy years. 
        His widow survived until 1825. </p>
