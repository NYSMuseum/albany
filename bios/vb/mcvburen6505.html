<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Maas Cornelise</strong></a>  was born during the 1640s. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> settlers Cornelis and Cathalina Martens Maas. In time, this family would be known in the region by the surname "Van Buren." Closer to Albany, they were known as "<a href="../b/bloom.html">Bloomendal</a>." The parents died in 1648 leaving Maas and his siblings to be raised by guardians on their Papsknee Island farm.

<p>By 1683, he had married <a href="../g/jacgardinier.html">Jacomyntje Gardinier</a>. By 1701, at least six shildren had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>For a couple decades, these Van Burens (Maase) were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#166">mainstays</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#6505">1684</a>, he owed back taxes.  In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6505">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. He also signed petitions regarding the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In 1702, his third ward property was assessed at a modest five poinds.

<p>Maas Cornelise Van Buren was no longer in the city by <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#jacg">1709</a> when Jacomyntie was identified at the owner of the Albany property. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources state he may have lived until 1733!
