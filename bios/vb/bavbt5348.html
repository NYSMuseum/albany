<strong>Baltus Van Benthuysen</strong></a> was born in March 1742. He was the son of <a href="japvbt5344.html">Jacobus</a> (James Parker) and <a href="../c/sacooper506.html">Sara Cooper</a> Van Benthuysen. He was named for his <a href="bavbt5339.html">grandfather</a> - a long-dead Albany businessman. Baltus grew up a member of the large family of a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> woodworker.</P>

<p>In August 1762, he married a "Mrs. Sara Viele" at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. He married again in December 1768. His second wife was <a href="../../drc.html">A</a>lbany native Eizabeth Rumney. By 1786, ten children had been born to the two marriages. He was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>By mid decade, this Van Benthuysen homestead was a fixture on first ward <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. Baltus was a member of a city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company and was paid for services from the Albany treasury. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, he was named <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the first ward.

<p>In June 1769, he was named along with seven living siblings in the <a href="../../wills/willjapvbt5344.html">will</a> filed by his father. He also was appointed co-executor.

<p>In his early thirties at the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, we expect to uncover more of his wartime service record. Afterwards, he was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5348">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia company. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5348">1779</a>, his house and property were valued on the first ward assessment rolls. In 1785, he was elected collector for the third ward. About that <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq#v=onepage&q=&f=false">time</a>, he began to be involved with building the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> house and then leasing it from the city of Albany. He held the ferry lease at least thru 1788.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5348">1790</a>, his household included eight members and a slave and was located near <a href="../../census1790.html#506">that</a> of his widowed mother. However, after that, the name of Baltus Van Benthuysen seems to have dropped from Albany rolls.</p>
