<P><a href="#sources"><b>Geertruy Van Benthuysen</b></a> was born about 1670. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="pamvbt.html">Paulus Martense</a> and <a href="../vkl/cavkleeck.html">Catharina Van Kleeck</a> Van Benthuysen.</p>


<p>She may have married three times. From information provided when she joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in April 1693, her first husband would have been a man named "Becker." In February 1699, her marriage to city marshall <a href="../p/japarker5308.html">James Parker</a> was sanctioned by the Dutch church. That marriage appeared to have produced no children.</p>

<p>These Parkers lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> in a neighborhood settled by former <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison soldiers</a>.</p>

<p>In December 1717, her Albany house was mentioned in the minutes of the city council. At that time, she was called a widow!  In August 1718, she married Robert Teunis Van Deusen. The name of Geertruy Van Benthuysen Becker Parker Van Deusen has not been found in the community record after her third marriage!</p>

<p>If she did indeed marry an unprecedented three times, it may be telling us about the vulnerability of some widows in early Albany!</p>
