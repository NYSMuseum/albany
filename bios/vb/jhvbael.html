<P>The <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Hendrickse Van Bael</strong></a> lived in Beverwyck<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA92&lpg=RA2-PA92#v=onepage&q&f=false">/</a>Albany and its environs from at least the late 1650s to the late 1670s. A number of same or similarly <a href="../b/jhbruyn7464.html">named</a> contemporaries are at risk in the greater Albany area. This individual is <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/17th/dny_12.shtml">said</a> to have been born in 1636 and to have died in 1682. As with many of his contemporaries, a paucity of sources inhibits us from providing much original insight on his life. This outline <a href="../../res/bios.html#sketch">sketch</a> organizes what is known and thought of regarding his life. 

<p>In July 1658, he <a href="../../sources.html#era">purchased</a> a house and lot in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> from Uldrick Klien. 

<p>Beginning in 1661, he is said to have been a "free trader" and freeholder in Beverwyck. However, his name is absent from the <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">list</a> of area traders compiled in 1660.
 
<p>He is thought to have owned <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nkHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22van+bael%22+albany+street&source=bl&ots=-hFTq0O4y4&sig=0EUUW10YZoZhq8rIQesqvXMI-_4&hl=en&ei=HQEVTLelOoHGlQf_pJH-DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22van%20bael%22%20albany%20street&f=false">property</a> on the north side of what became <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> above its intersection with Pearl.

<p>In October 1674, he was among those <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html">invited</a> to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer. At that time, he was identified as "Cornet Jan H. van Bael." 

<p>Jan Hendrickse Van Bael is said to have had a son and three daughters. Perhaps, his wife was the widow <a href="../t/heteller6609.html">Helena Teller</a> Bogardus.

<p>He is said to have died in 1682. Thus, his widow re-married in 1683. </p>

<p>As late as 1775, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gqqwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA753&lpg=PA753&dq=%22van+baal%22+jan+albany&source=bl&ots=ReAw3wKEAq&sig=k51E8q_c9RiIa4gNEdJH5ziWoRQ&hl=en&ei=5OIUTJqhFsP_lgfsrP3xDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22van%20baal%22%20jan%20albany&f=false">legislation</a> surrounding the so-called "Van <a href="../../res/sp.html">Baal</a> Patent" of 1672 (along the upper Normanskill <a href="../../na/na.html">in</a> today's Guilderland) was enacted by the provincial government.</p>
