<strong>James Parker Van Benthuysen</strong></a> was born in October 1772. He was the first-born son in the large family Obadiah and Anna Rumney Van Benthuysen. 

<p>His wife was named <a href="anvbt.html">Hannah</a> (perhaps Anna Myers). By 1798, the marriage had produced a number of children. By 1809, three (including two <a href="../p/japarker5308.html">namesakes</a>) of them had been buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html#">Dutch church</a>.

<p>This James Parker VBT lived at 27 <a href="../../streets.html#division">Division Street</a>. He was a <a href="../../trades/leather.html#last">shoe</a> and lastmaker (form for holding and working on footwear) with a store on <a href="../../streets.html#court">S</a>outh Market Street. Both his properties were noted each year from <http://="books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA92,M1">1813</a> into the 1830s in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#5384">1800</a>, he probably shared that home with his brothers. He served as a fireman in 1800. He also was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. 

<p>James Parker Van Benthuysen died in May 1835. The obituary noted that he was sixty-two. According to family <a href="../../res/ts.html">records</a>, his widow survived until 1878 and was buried in the <a href="http://newyorkgravestones.org/view.php?id=4652">old</a> cemetery in Pottersville, Warren County.
