          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Catharina Van Brugh</B></A> was born in New York in 
            1665. She was the daughter of merchant Johannes Pieterse and <a href="pvbrugh.html#roeloffs">Catharina 
            Roeloffs</a> Van Brugh.</P>

          <p>In March 1689, she married <a href="../vr/hvr5053.html">Hendrick 
            Van Rensselaer</a> in the New York City Dutch church where their first 
            child was baptized a few days after the wedding. Before long, the 
            couple moved to Albany where Hendrick's family owned a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">great 
            estate</a> and where Catharina's brother, <a href="pvbrugh.html">Pieter 
            Van Brugh</a>, would be appointed mayor of Albany in 1699. Her remaining 
            ten children were baptized in the Albany Dutch church where both parents 
            were <a href="#members">active members</a>.</P>

<p>Catharina raised her large family in Albany and at their country seat called Crailo. Seven of her <a href="http://otal.umd.edu/~walt/gen/htmfile/962.htm">sons and daughters</a> married and raised families in the region - bringing a steady stream of visitors to this Van Rensselaer home for many years.</p>  
 
<p>"Katie" Van Rensselaer died at Greenbush in December 1730. An early Albany matriarch, she lived for more than sixty-five years and was buried from the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch church</a>.</p>

            life of <B>Catharina Van Brugh Van Rensselaer</B> is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography 
            number</A> 8627. This profile is derived chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The basic genealogical source for the family is "The Van Brugh Family," by John Ross Delafield as printed in <a href="../../sources.html#nygbr">NYGBR</a> vol 66 (1935). The Van Brugh name passed from Albany rolls with the death of Pieter Van Brugh in 1740. However, the marriage of her Van Rensselaer children rooted the family in early New York society.</P>

<p><a name=members></a>By 1724, <b>Catharina</b> had witnessed (or sponsored) more than twenty baptisms at the Albany Dutch church. She was probably a pewholder - but we have found no pewholding records for her lifetime.</P>
