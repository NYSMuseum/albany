<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Judith Van Buren </strong></a> was born in April 1735. She was the daughter of Johannes and Eytie (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Ida</a>) Van Buren. Her long-lived father is <a href="http://www.castleton-on-hudson.org/History.shtml">said</a> to have been a farmer of some note and among the early settlers of Schodack/Castleton. 

<p>In February 1756, Judike married Albany native <a href="../t/tote4907.html">Tobias C. Ten Eyck</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, she was identified as a native of "Schotak." By 1765, four children had been christened in Albany.

<P>These Ten Eycks made their home south of Albany on a farm in Coeymans. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4907">1790</a>, her nine person household was served by ten slaves. 

<p>Tobias Ten Eyck died in 1791. His will passed probate in 1792. After that, his widow has not been accounted for in the <a href="../../cbr.html">comm</a>unity-based documents examined so far.
