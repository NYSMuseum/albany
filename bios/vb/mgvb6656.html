<P><a href="#sources"><b>Marte Gerritse Van Bergen</b></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> Martin Gerritsen) was born about 1630. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer Marte Gerritse. They seem to have been of Norwegian ancestry. </p>

<p>His first wife was Jannetje Teunisz. In January 1686, this widower married blacksmith's daughter <a href="../vi/comvi2340.html">Neeltje Mynderts</a> at the Albany Dutch church. Over the next decade, five of their children were baptized there where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p><a href="../../furtrade.html">Trader</a> and regional landholder, Marte Gerritse also was an Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#6656">householder</a> whose name appeared prominently on a number of city-based survey documents. He served for many years as an Albany magistrate and was called "Captain." He also leased a farm on <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a> and employed a company of farmers. His primary residence, however, appeared to be at Catskill or Coxsackie!</p>

<p>Marte Gerritse Van Bergen filed a will in January 1696. It named his wife and two sons as the heirs of his farm, land at Catskill, and other personal property. Later that spring, he was <a href="#killed">killed</a> by French Indians. According to his instructions, an <a href="../../wills/willmgvb6656.html">inventory of his estate</a> was made following his death. Marte Gerritse's will passed probate in December.

<p>In June <a href="../../census1697.html#2340">1697</a>, his widow and five children were identified as Rensselaerswyck householders. Neeltie re-married later that year, bore more children,  and lived until 1758.</p>
