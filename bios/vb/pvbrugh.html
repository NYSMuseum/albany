<P><A href="#biography"><B>Pieter Van Brugh</B></A> was born in 1666 the oldest son of Manhattan-based overseas trader Johannes Pieterse and <a  href="#roeloffs">Catharina Roeloffs</a> Van Brugh. His father had prospered in New Netherland by exporting furs and other forest products consigned from upriver. Under the English, the elder Van Brugh became a civic leader and even improved his status with the marriages of four daughters and two sons to upwardly mobile commercial and landholding families.</P>

<P>In November 1688, Pieter married <a href="../c/sacuyler609.html">Sara Cuyler</a> of Albany in the New York Dutch Reformed church. Their only child was born in 1689. Later that year, he was commissioned a lieutenant in a company of New York City militia. Shortly thereafter, these Van Brughs joined the Cuylers in Albany where Pieter had entered the family business.</P>

<p>Taking up residence in the Cuyler home on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>, Pieter Van Brugh continued the family practice of collecting farm and forest products for shipment to New York. In 1692, he began public life as a constable, was made high constable in 1693, and served as assessor, collector, and contractor for many years after. By <a href="../../census1697.html#006">1697</a>, he had inherited the Cuyler property and had become an Albany regular. An officer of the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch church</a>, in 1707 his family grew when he was appointed guardian of the daughters of John Donaldson - a recently deceased  brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Rising fortunes upriver and influential connections in New York led to his appointment as 
<a href="../../mayors.html#pvbrugh">mayor</a> of Albany in 1699. Although replaced after one year, he was named mayor again in 1721. During the first decades of the eighteenth-century, Pieter Van Brugh was among the <a href="#wealth">wealthiest</a> of Albany businessmen. He had inherited land in the Delaware valley from his father and acquired more land on his own in the city and in the <a href="#countryside">countryside</a>. He was elected to the provincial Assembly for a term in 1705, in 1713, and again in 1727. He also was an active member of the Albany <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a> until the 1730s. By that time, Van Brugh's extensive interests were being managed by his son-in-law, Philip Livingston.</p>

<p>He died in July 1740 at the age of seventy-four. He was one of the last people to be buried beneath the Albany Dutch church. With no sons, the Van Brugh family name passed from Albany rolls with his <a href="#will">death</a>.</p>

            number</A> 5300. He was baptized in the New York City Dutch church 
            on July 7, 1666. The basic genealogical source for the family is "The 
            Van Brugh Family," by John Ross Delafield as printed in <a href="../../sources.html#nygbr"><i>NYGBR</i></a> 
            vol 66 (1935), especially pp. 171-72. We know of no other narrative 
            biography of him. His connection to the Livingston family is considered 
            in Milton M. Klein, <i>The American Whig: William Livingston of New 
            York</i> (revised edition: New York, 1993), 14-15. The best source 
            for the development of the New York City business elite is Joyce D. 
            Goodfriend, <i>Before the Melting Pot: Society and Culture in Colonial 
            New York City, 1664-1730</i> (Princeton, NJ, 1992).</P>

<p><a name=roeloffs></a><b>Catharina Roeloffs</b> was a daughter of the legendary <a href="../j/anjans.html">Anneke Jans</a> and her first husband. Johannes Pieterse may have met his future wife on one of his trading trips upriver to Beverwyck. See <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">PFS</a>, 142, where his family is called "Verbrugge."</p>

<p><a name=countryside></a>Van Brugh was a partner in a <b>land patent</b> located along the Schoharie Creek in the Mohawks country called Huntersfield and in a tract located east of the Hoosick Patent.</P>
