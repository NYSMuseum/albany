      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter Van Bergen</strong></a> (sometime 
        called "Petrus") probably was born before 1750. Based on subsequent information, 
        it does not appear that he was born in Albany. His parentage is <a href="../../res/origins.html">uncertain</a> 
        to us. Perhaps two Albany residents of the same name were in the city 
        during the 1790s. 
      <p>During the 1760s, Petrus Van Bergen paid <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">taxes</a> 
        on a first ward property. He was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company in 1767 and witnessed a <a href="../../wills/willthsharp.html">will</a> 
        in March 1771. 
      <p>However, not until September 1774, did Mayor Abraham C. Cuyler sign and 
        seal a <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html#sig">document</a> granting him 
        the <a href="../../nat.html">freedom</a> of the city. That official status 
        would entitle him to the full rights of Albany residency. 
      <p>In 1775, he <a href="../../coc.html">contributed</a> for the relief of 
        Ticonderoga. His first ward property was configured on the assessment 
        rolls in 1779. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#pvb">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>This individual lived first in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> where he paid <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">taxes</a> 
        (<font size=-1>see <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#pvb">1788</a></font size>) 
        and participated in community-based service activities. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1785">1785</a>, 
        he was appointed assessor for the first ward and in 1789 served as election 
        inspector. 
      <p>His first ward household was configured on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1790.html#pvb">1790</a>. 
        At that time, it included two adults and two children. 
      <p>After the early 1790s, we are less certain of the number of historical 
        characters living in Albany and named Peter Van Bergen. 
      <p>In 1797, a Peter Van Bergen was identified as a "yeoman" living in the 
        first ward on a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">list</a> of 
        Albany freeholders. However, that same list included a "gentleman" named 
        Peter Van Bergen as living in the second ward. 
      <p>All subsequent community-based materials (census, assessments), point 
        to the Pearl and Columbia Street properties of Peter Van Bergen. The census 
        of <a href="../../census1800.html#pvb">1800</a>, profiles a second ward 
        household headed by Peter Van Bergen who was born before 1755. 
      <p>That probably would not have been the individual who married <a href="../f/elfryer.html">Elizabeth 
        Fryer</a> in March 1797 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        She <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA183&lpg=PA183&dq=%22peter+van+bergen%22+albany&source=web&ots=Sp5oSIxoum&sig=ESca7m2WTDxVTKwolfpyPkQYUuQ">died</a> 
        in 1848 at the age of eighty- two - placing her birth at about 1775. During 
        the 1790s, Peter Van Bergen was a pewholder at the Albany Dutch church 
        where, over the next decade, his children were christened there as well. 
      <p>From census records, we know that Peter Van Bergen of Albany was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dQP3qrougnkC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%22peter+van+bergen%22+albany&source=web&ots=qF8ELxjaib&sig=EinqZMaNgZ4IXO5tYM9QVTkq-_w">slaveholder</a> 
        as well. 
      <p>For the Peter Van Bergen(s), those resources cease after 1810. <br>
