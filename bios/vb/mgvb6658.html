      <P>A number of individuals were <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as 
        "Martin Gerritse Van Bergen" and lived in the Hudson Valley during the 
        eighteenth century. The Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Martin 
        Gerritse Van Bergen</strong></a> was born during the first half of the 
        eighteenth century. He probably was the son of Peter Van Bergen and thus 
        the grandson and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ct=result&id=cFIOAAAAIAAJ&dq=aA30_VBSq7&pg=PA320&lpg">namesake</a> 
        of Martin Gerritsen Van Bergen - a prominent Catskill landholder who filed 
        a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ct=result&id=cFIOAAAAIAAJ&dq=aA30_VBSq7&pg=PA319&lpg">will</a> 
        in 1765. 
      <p>A daybook of his accounts in conjunction with the Hudson River sloop 
        <i>Delancey</i> for the years 1749-65 is in the "<a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc10844.htm">Van 
        Bergen Family Papers</a>" collection of the <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/mssdesc.htm">New 
        York State Library</a>. 
      <p>Because of the existence of several contemporary, same-named individuals, 
        this sketch only presents information that has a definite Albany city 
        context. 
      <p>In April 1760, the "Albany" Martin Van Bergen was left a negro man named 
        "Dick" in the <a href="../../wills/willmgtbleecker212.html">will</a> of 
        widow <a href="../b/mgtbleecker212.html">Margaret Collins</a>. Perhaps, 
        he was the Martin G. Van Bergen who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willthlynott.html">will</a> 
        of former Albany resident <a href="../l/thlynott1147.html">Th</a>omas 
        Lynott in 1769. From the 1750s to the 1780s, Van Bergen witnessed the 
        filing of a number of legal documents. 
      <p>In 1766 and 1767, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property 
        was valued substantially on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. In 1779, his first ward house and lot still was on the Albany 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">tax list</a>. Perhaps he lived 
        near the <a href="../..//lists/list1788tl.html#jas">Sharp family</a> homestead 
        and in the house occupied by <a href="pevbergen.html">Peter Van Bergen</a> 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#pvb">1788</a>. 
      <p>His <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">wartime</a> activities have not been 
        clarified. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#pet">1779</a>, he signed 
        a community based petition for the return of Dr. Henry Van Dyck. He did 
        <a href="../../cddc.html">post bail</a> for merchant <a href="../w/dawaters6821.html">David 
        Waters</a> in 1781 (at that time he was called a "yeoman") and later was 
        accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6658">land bounty right</a> 
        in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>In any event, the will of Martin Gerritse Van Bergen passed probate in 
        Albany County on February 9, 1789. </p>
