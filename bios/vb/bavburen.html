<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent Van Buren</strong></a> was born early in 1695. He was an older son of Pieter Martense and Ariaantie (aka <a href="../vi/vi.html">Mynderts</a>) Van Buren. His parents appear to have been long time residents of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</A>. A slightly younger, same-named contemporary also lived in the region and <a href="">perhaps</a> complicates the assignment of subsequent family and qualitative information.

<p>In December 1719, he married <a href="../w/mawinne3009.html">Maria Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She was the <a href="../w/piwinne3032.html">sister</a> of Albany skipper and assemblyman Pieter Winne. By 1726, only two children had been christened in Albany. However, by 1736, <a href="http://hackerscreek.com/norman/VANBUREN.htm">several more</a> may have been baptized elsewhere. In December 1737, <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Barent-Van-Buren/5609886690240028321">some sources</a> say that he may have remarried. Thus, his second wife would have been <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Margarita Van Vechten. However, at this point it appears unlikely! &nbsp;  By 1741, that marriage had produced three children. He probably could not have been the BVB who married Catalina Schermerhorn and had children with her during the 1750s. The second two marriages create several problems in fleshing out other aspects of his life. 

<p>This individual seems to be the only Barent Van Buren at-risk during the first half of the eighteenth century. That said, in 1757 Barent Van Buren was named in the <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne3032.html">will</a> filed by the above-mentioned Pieter Winne. Called the husband of the testator's sister, he also was named co-exectutor of Winne's estate.    

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#bavb">1763</a>, the name of Barent Van Buren appeared on a list of freeholders in Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">County</a>. Assessment rolls from the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">mid-1760s</a> valued the Kinderhook holdings of Barent Van Buren among the village's elite. At least another Barent (C. or T.) was assessed in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">East Manor</a>.
 
<p>In October 1769, Barent Van Buren "of Kinderhook" is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vjIRAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22barent+van+buren%22&source=bl&ots=1-Y1kSZNpF&sig=S1Eeq7tlZlzowcL1Jb72FNe5Cg4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg8q-34I7NAhXLaT4KHb8zA4Y4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=snippet&q=winne&f=false">said</a> to have filed a will. His substantial real property in what would become Columbia County was to be divided among his three sons. At that time, Barent's wife "Mary" was still living and would be provided for in a number of ways. That will is said to have been "registered" in August 1787. A will for <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Barent Van Buren  passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in Albany County in October 1790.</p>
