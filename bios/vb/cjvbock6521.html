<strong>Claes Janse</strong></a> probably was born in Europe during the second quarter of the seventeenth century. Several possibilities exist as to his origins. He sometimes was <a href="../../res/sp.html">re</a>ferred to as "Claas de Brabender" or as "Bokhovan."

<p>During his lifetime, he held land in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, at <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canastigione</a>, in Albany, and at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. Although he owned a number of houses and a farm as well, the number of his real estate transactions might support characterizing him as a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> trader. 

<p>By 1662, he was living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and had a lot on the <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Vosenkill</a>. He also held land beyond the north gate.

<p>His first wife was Volkertje Jans. In February 1691, he signed a contract to marry <a href="../d/cadvos7854.html">Cathalina De Vos</a> - the widow of Andries Bradt. It appears that these marriages produced no children. However he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the years, he also had a number of slaves and at least one indentured servant. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#152">1697</a>, he was living alone with another man and was identified as "Claes Rust." In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his third ward house was listed on the Albany assessment roll.

<p>Folowing his second marriage, he is said to have lived in Schenectady. In 1709, his widow was listed on a Schenectady assessment roll.

<p>He filed a <a href="../../wills/willcjvbock.html">will</a> in January 1699. It stated that he was of the village of Schenectady. It made a number of substantial and interesting provisions. Claes Janse Van Bockhoven was dead by April 1712 when the will passed probate.</p>
