<P><a href="#sources"><b>Dorite Jans</b></a> is <a href="../d/douw.html#sources">said</a> to have come from "Breestede," (Denmark). But, perhaps, she was born in New Amsterdam about 1627<a href="#sources">!</a></p>


<p>She married <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="../d/vjd.html">Volkert Janse Douw</a> at the New Amsterdam Dutch church in April 1650. The marriage produced at least eleven children who <a href="../../familynames.html">established</a> the Douw family in Albany and its environs.</p>

<p>These Douws were Beverwyck then Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#vjd">mainstays</a>.  He was a trader, skipper, brewer, and landholder. Volkert Janse owned acreage in the countryside around Albany and beyond. Dorite's large family knew a number of retreats throughout the region. Her family, the Van Breestedes,  also had become prominent in greater New York.</p>

<p>Volkert Janse died in 1681. His will left Dorite use of his substantial estate. In 1684, she sold a large portion of Douw's Albany property to the Dutch church. At that time, her "house" was on <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html#paps">Papsknee Island</a>. A few years, later, she sold land on Schodack Island. In <a href="../../census1697.html#8009">1697</a>, her house appeared on the census for the colony of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 

<p>Dorite Jans Van Breestede Douw died in November 1701. She was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
