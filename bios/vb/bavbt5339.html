<strong>Baltus Van Benthuysen</strong></a> may have been born as late as the early 1680s. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="pamvbt.html">Paulus Martense</a> and <a href="../vkl/cavkleeck.html">Catharina Van Kleeck</a> Van Benthuysen.


<p>In February 1707, he married New York native <a href="../d/lydealy5402.html">Lydia Dealy</a> at the New York Dutch church. By 1721, most of their five children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Van Benthuysens first made their <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5339">home</a> in Albany's first ward either with or next to <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#cavk">that</a> of his widowed mother. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1708">1708</a>, he was named constable for the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1709">1709</a>, he was appointed high constable. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5339">1720</a>, he was identified as a freeholder in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. His mother died in 1722.


<p>Baltus Van Benthuysen filed a <a href="../../wills/willbavbt5339.html">will</a> in November 1720. He identified himself as a merchant of Albany city with a house and lot in both Albany and in Kingston.  Balthus was dead by 1722. The will passed probate in March 1725. His widow re-married in 1733.</p>
