<!-- Start Main Content -->
<P>The story of the what became the <a href="#sources">
<strong>Van Benthuysen</strong></a> family in Albany begins with the arrival of <a href="pamvbt.html">Paulus Martense</a> in New Netherland. He <a href="../../census1697.html#031">settled</a> in Albany and his descendants established the family there and elsewhere in New York. 

<p>His son, <a href="bavbt5339.html">Baltus</a>, was a a merchant during the early 1700s with houses in Albany and Kingston.

<p>Although the marriage in 1699 of soldier's son <a href="../p/japarker5308.html">James Parker</a> and the widow who was born <a href="gevbt2318.html">Geertruy Van Benthuysen</a> produced no children, several family members were "James Parker Van Benthuysen" in honor of Albany's first city marshall. 

<p>In 1736, Kingston native <a href="gevbt5352.html">Gerrit Van Benthuysen</a> was an Albany resident and was elected alderman for the first ward. However, within a few years, he  left the city and re-located to Dutchess County.

<P>A list of  Albany-area freeholders from <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a> included only the name of skipper <a href="japvbt5344.html">James Parker Van Benthuysen</a>.
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the first Federal census showed four Van Benthuysen-named households in the city of Albany (all in the first ward) and one more in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>.

<p>During the early 1800s, the family was prominent in Albany printing and publishing. Three Van Benthuysens were counted among the <a href="../../ams.html#members">m</a>embership of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA92,M1">1813</a>, nine Van Benthuysen-named addresses appeared in the city directory.

<p>Since then, the Van Benthuysen family has spread out in New York State and <a href="http://www.elmsmansion.com/">across</a> the country as well.</p>
