<P>The Albany <a href="#sources"> <strong>Van Bergen</strong></a> family probably begins with <a href="mgvb6656.html">Martin Gerritse Van Bergen</a> who is said to have been born in <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> about 1630. His name was carried through subsequent generations who lived in Albany and the greater Hudson Valley. He was dead by 1697 when his <a href="../vi/comvi2340.html">widow</a> was listed among the Albany householders. For a time, <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a> was referred to as "<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22marte+gerritse's+island%22&spf=1501501878000">Marte Gerritse's Island</a>."
 
<p>Perhaps this <a href="../../familynames.html">family</a> group is not closely connected to the Bergen <a href="../b/sabergen.html">daughters</a> who came from Brooklyn to become matriarchs of Albany households.

<p>Skipper <a href="mgvb6658.html">Martin Gerritsen Van Bergen</a> was a prominent resident and regional landholder of the mid-eighteenth century.

<p><a href="pevbergen.html">Peter Van Bergen</a> represented the family in the city during the <a href="../../census1800.html#pvb">last</a> quarter of the century. At least seven other Van Bergen named households were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1g9Qu5LmecEC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=%22martin+van+bergen%22&source=bl&ots=7onnwQ6KZo&sig=yO8qbKWbtH1HOrji4630h_-hdX0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJ3Nnck97UAhUKeT4KHaQXCQg4ChDoAQgwMAU#v=onepage&q=%22martin%20van%20bergen%22&f=false">configured</a> on the First Federal Census in 1790 elsewhere in <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. 

<p>The Van Bergens intermarried and flourished through the female side of the family. However, only the Pearl Street address of silversmith <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> John Bergen was 
listed in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22bergen%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22bergen%22&f=false">first city directory</a> in 1813.</p>

<p>The iconic <a href="http://collections.fenimoreartmuseum.org/van-bergen-overmantel">Van 
        Bergen Overmantel</a> (dated about 1733 and attributed to itinerant and 
        sometimes Albany artist <a href="../h/joheaton.html">John Heaton</a>) 
        is known as the farm of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Martin Van 
        Bergen located near Leeds (today's Greene County). It frequently has been 
        used to represent a "<a href="../../nnd.html">Dutch</a>" farming operation 
        of the mid-eighteenth century. We still seek a documented connection to 
        the Albany Van Bergens. 
      <p>At this point, we are uncertain about the possible connection of the Albany Bergens and Van Bergens to the Bergens of Bergen County, <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22van+bergen%22+new+jersey&spf=1498571662212">New Jersey</a>.
