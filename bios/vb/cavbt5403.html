<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Van Benthuysen</b></a> may have been born in 1661. She was the first daughter born to Albany residents <a href="pamvbt.html">Paulus Martense</a> and <a href="../vkl/cavkleeck.html">Catharina Van Kleeck</a> Van Benthuysen. She grew up in Albany as her parents lived at several locations. Her father was a wheelwright and windowmaker of some note.</p>

<p>By the early 1680s, she had married Kinderhook native <a href="../t/jaturck5323.html">Jacobus Turck</a>. By 1700, eight children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and occasional baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, these Turcks were first ward <a href="../../census1697.html#139">mainstays</a>. Jacobus was a trader who served on the city council and was appointed sheriff of Albany County in 1702.</p>

<p>Catharina Van Benthuysen Turck died in February 1705. Her husband soon re-married!</p>
