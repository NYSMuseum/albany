<strong>Gerrit Van Benthuysen</strong></a> was was born in January 1702 and christened at the Dutch church in Kingson. He was the son of Albany native Barent Van Benthuysen and his second wife, Jannetie Van Wagenen Van Benthuysen. He probably grew up in the Kingston area. However, his roots were in Albany as his <a href="pamvbt.html">grandfather</a> first settled in Beverwyck during the 1650s. 

<p>In July 1728, he married Albany native <a href="../va/mavallen5627.html">Maria Van Allen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1738, five children had been christened in Albany. However, their mother died following the last birth in January 1738. In November, Gerrit married Frances Lewis in New York City. He was a member and occasional baptism sponsor in Albany.

<p>In March <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ct=result&id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22garrit+van+benthuysen%22&ots=Fjnc3VocRc&jtp=319">1733</a>, he was paid by the provincial government for the "passage of soldiers."  Perhaps, he was a skipper. 

<p>These Van Benthuysens made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.  On several occasions, he was paid by the city for delivering wood. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1732">1732</a>, he was appointed firemaster. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>, he was elected alderman. He was elected alderman again in 1740 but not thereafter. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5352">1742</a>, he was listed among the first ward freeholders.

<p>After that, he appears to have left Albany.

<P>Gerrit Van Benthuysen filed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8Rc8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA198&lpg=PA198&dq=%22gerrit+van+benthuysen%22&source">will</a> in June 1759. At that time, he was a "gentleman" of Rhinebeck in Dutchess County and stated that he was "sick and weak." The will left his real and personal property to his three living children. The will passed probate in January 1783.</p>
