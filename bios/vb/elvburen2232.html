<P>Albany wife <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Van Buren</strong></a> was born in January 1718. Christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany, she was a middle child in the large family of Pieter and Geertruy Vosburgh Van Buren of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>.

<p>In Octobr 1742, she married Albany native <a href="../c/thcooper509.html">Thomas Cooper</a> at the Albany church. By 1748, the marriage had produced four children.

<p>These Coopers began to raise their family in the home of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> tailor and among the households of other Cooper kin.

<p>However, the marriage would not be a long one. Elizabeth Van Buren Cooper died in early September 1748. Her last child was christened on October 23. She had lived for just thirty years. By 1750, her husband had re-married. Tomas Cooper lived on in Albany until his passing in 1801.</p>
