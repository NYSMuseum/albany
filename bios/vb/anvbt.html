<strong>Hannah/Anna Van Benthuysen</strong></a> was the wife of Albany shoemaker and storekeeper <a href="japvbt5384.html">James Parker Van Benthuysen</a>. Based on so-called cemetery information, she may have been born in 1775. Perhaps, her maiden name was Myers. 

<p>About 1795, she married Albany native James Parker Van Benthuysen - although the marriage has not been found in the available records of <a href="../../churches.html">Albany's churches</a>. By 1798, three sons had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Later church records show that she had joined the Second Dutch Reformed church.

<p>These Van Benthuysens lived modestly on <a href="../../streets.html#division">Division Street</a> for several decades.

<p>Hannah's husband died in 1835. However, we seek information on the later years of the marriage and her public record as a widow. 

<p>The widow Hannah Van Benthuysen died in July 1878 and was buried in the old cemetery in Pottersville, Warren County. She had lived ninety-two years - making her a widow for more than four decades.</p>
