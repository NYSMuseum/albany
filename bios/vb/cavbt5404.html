        Rhinebeck resident father in March 1767. By that time, her mother had 
        passed on. 
      <p>Probably in 1784, Catalyntie married thirty-two-year-old former Revolutionary 
        war officer <a href="../w/johwendell2975.html">John H. Wendell</a>. By 
        1804, the marriage had produced ten children who were christened at the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
      <p>She raised her large family on <a href="../../census1790.html#2975">Market</a> 
        and then Columbia Streets in the <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">old 
        Dutch house</a> that was Wendell's childhood home. He operated a store 
        and was a prominent Albany and state official. In 1813, their home address 
        was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=%22wendell+john h.%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22wendell%20john h.%22&f=false">27
