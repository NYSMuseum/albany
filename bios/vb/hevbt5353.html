<strong>Hendrick Van Benthuysen</strong></a> was born in October 1762. He was the son of <a href="japvbt5344.html">Jacobus Parker</a> and <a href="../c/sacooper506.html">Sara Cooper</a> Van Benthuysen. He was a younger son in the large family of a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> woodworker.</P>

<p>He was one of eight children named in the <a href="../../wills/willjapvbt5344.html">will</a> filed by his father in June 1769.

<p>We seek information on his wartime service as afterwards the young man was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5353">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the 
Albany militia regiment.

<p>In December 1785, he married Albany native Cathalina Hun at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1804, six children were christened in the church where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>Coming of age during the 1780s, for almost fifty years, Hendrick Van Benthuysen was an Albany mainstay. He practiced the <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a>'s trade from his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22van+benthuysen+henry%22&source#v=onepage&&f=false">home</a> at <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">what</a> became 49 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>.



<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1788">1788</a> and 1791, he served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fireman</a> in the first ward. In <a href="../../census1790.html#5353">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1790.html#5353">1800</a>, city census returns configured his first ward household with two children. 

 <P>In December 1833, he made a statment in support of the pension application of his brother <a href="wmvbt5360.html">William</a>. Hendrick Van Benthuysen died in June 1834 at the age of seventy-two. His widow survived until 1841.</p>
