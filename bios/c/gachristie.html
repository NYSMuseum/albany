<P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/gabchristie.jpg" align=left border=0 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=150 alt="Gabbriel Christie"></a><a href="#sources"><b>Gabriel Christie</b></a> was a career British army officer who was stationed in Albany during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. He may have been born in 1722.</p>

<p>He was a Captain serving in Albany during the summer of 1757 when he engaged in a jurisdictional <a href="../../doc/ayjrjournal.html#christie">dispute</a> with Albany sheriff <a href="../y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a></p> 


<p>About that time, he married <a href="../s/sastevenson3896.html">Sarah Stevenson</a>, the daughter of an Albany merchant and official. Their son, Napier, was baptized in Albany in 1758.</p>

<p>After the war, he established a settlement at Isle Aux Noir and held other lands along the Richelieu River. In 1765, purchased Isle La Motte. He had a home in Montreal and owned other Canadian properties as well. 

<p>Military duties took him to Florida, Barbadoes, and Antigua.

<p>Did he participate in the British invasions from Canada in 1776 and 1777?

<p>He died in Montreal in November 1799.</p>

<p>While not really a resident of Albany itself, his military duties and marital connection to the Stevensons prompt us to profile his life. Sometimes he is confused with a contemporary - officeholder Gabriel Christie of Maryland.</p>
