<P>In 1765, <a href="#sources"><strong>James Cobham</strong></a> lived in a house owned by <a href="../r/toryckman1994.html">Tobias Ryckman</a> located across from <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">City Hall</a>.

<p>In June 1764, he was called "Mr. Cobham" when he was charged six shillings by the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> for the burial of his mother.

<p>In 1767, his first ward location was listed on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment roll</a> as he was taxed comparably to other business people. 

<p>Was this individual the "James L. Cobham" who was a <a href="http://www.electricscotland.com/history/scotreg/maccomb/cd.htm">clerk</a> for Gregg and Cunningham of New York City during the 1750s and/or 60s?

<p>In 1779, "John" Cobham was living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> when his personal property was assessed $1,000. In July, he was called a prisoner of war when he was called before the <a href="../../cddc.html">Albany Commissioners</a> and was charged with corresponding with the enemy on his frequent trips northward into the upper Hudson Valley. At that time, he did take the oath of allegiance to the United States. As late as March 1781, he was under the scrutiny of the Albany Board.
