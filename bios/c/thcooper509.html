<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Cooper</strong></a> probably was 
        born before 1718. He was an older child in the large family of newcomers 
        <a href="obcooper495.html">Obadiah</a> and <a href="../g/corgardinier.html">Cornelia 
        Gardinier</a> Cooper. His parents would raise their family in a modest 
        home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 

      <p>In October 1742, he married <a href="../vb/elvburen2232.html">Elizabeth 
        Van Buren</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By the time Elizabeth died in September 1748, four of their children had 
        been christened in Albany where he would be a regular baptism sponsor. 
        By 1750, he had married Margarita Van Antwerpen. Perhaps, that marriage 
        produced no children. 

      <p>Following his father - who died in 1742, Thomas Cooper was a <a href="../../census1756.html#201">tailor</a> 
        who also lived in the first ward and close to the home of his <a href="abcooper455.html">brother</a> 
        - a weaver. Over the next three decades, he appeared to live <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">modestly</a> 
        on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. By 
        1788, his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#509">home</a> was accorded 
        a slight assesssment and encompassed the personal property of his <a href="obcooper498.html">son</a> 
        as well. But, by the census of <a href="../../census1790.html#498">1790</a>, 
        middle-aged Obadiah Cooper was shown as the head of that Albany household. 
        Thomas Cooper would have been included under the first ward household 
        of Obadiah on the census of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1800</a>. 
 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#509">1763</a>, his name appeared 
        on a long list of Albany freeholders. 

<p>Approaching sixty, Thomas Cooper probably would have been too old to have played an active roll in the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Revolution</a>. However, 
        he did contribute financial support and afterwards was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#509">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.
		 
<p>Thomas Cooper died in February 1801. He had lived for more than eighty years.</p>
