<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony Coster</b></a> was born about 1668. He was the only surviving son from the marriage of New Netherland pioneer <a href="hecoster5974.html">Henry Coster</a> and <a href="../vs/geervschaick4032.html">Geertje Van Schaick</a>.</p>


<p>His father died in 1678 and his mother soon <a href="../l/jolansing3440.html">re-married</a> and began a second family. By <a href="../../census1697.html#098">1697</a>, Anthony was living alone in an Albany house.  The next year, he married <a href="../t/eltbroeck38.html">Elizabeth Ten Broeck</a> - the daughter of his <a href="../../census1697.html#097">neighbor</a> who was one of the most important personages in the upriver region. The marriage produced four children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a frequent baptism sponsor. His <a href="hecoster5975.html">son</a> probably was a bachelor and sometime Albany resident who had ties to <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Os</a>wego.</p>

<p><a name=ambition></a>These Costers lived on the north side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. Anthony was identified as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> but had assets comparable to those of a successful merchant. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5968">1699</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany residents swearing allegiance to the king of England.</p>

<p>He served the community as assessor, firemaster, juror, and assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> in 1703. In <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">1715</a>, he was identified as a member of a troop of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5968">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, his name appeared on lists of freemen living in the city of Albany. He also owned pasture land south of the city.</p>

<p>Living into his eighties, Anthony Coster died in February 1753 and was buried in the church. The Coster name dropped from Albany rolls with his passing. His widow lived for four more years.</p>
