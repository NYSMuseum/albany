<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Harmanus Cuyler</strong></a> was born in May 1730.  He was the son of <a href="jocuyler580.html">Johannes A.</a> and <a href="../w/cawendell2769.html">Catharina     Wendell</a> Cuyler and the eldest of four surviving sons in a large Albany family that had lost both of its parents following the birth of Catharina's last child in 1746.
		 
<p>We are uncertain as to how these Cuyler children survived. Perhaps they were able to live in their parents' <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home. In any event, in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1753">1753</a>, Harmanus was appointed constable for the third ward. 

<p>In 1761, he is said to have married "Mary Marcelus" (<a href="../../res/sp.html">M</a>arselis).  In November 1771, he wed <a href="../vb/elvbergen6652.html">Elizabeth Van Bergen</a> in Coxsackie. Perhaps only one child was born to each marriage. Particularly prior to his second marriage, he was a member, pewholder, and occassional baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In 1764, he joined other Albany merchants in a community-based <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#528">petition</a> to the British regarding the fur trade. He also was a skipper whose sloop was plying the river during the summer of <a href="../../art/lott.html#0718">1774</a>. 

<p>In 1766, he stood in opposition to the Stamp Act when he joined in <a href="../../solconst.html#528">signing</a> the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. In 1767, he was a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>By that time, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings were being accorded moderate <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>. 

<p>By the mid 1770s, his name no longer appeared in the Albany community record. However, in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=txo8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA191&lpg">March 1777</a>, he was among those men from the southern part of <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Alb</a>any County who provided information to the New York State <a href="../../cddc.html">Co</a>mmissioners on Conspiracies. 

<p>Later, perhaps he was the Harmanus Cuyler whose Coxsackie property was accorded a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/coxsackie_tax_list_1788.htm">substantial assessment</a>.

<p>Harmanus Cuyler died in July 1794 at the age of sixty-four. Shortly thereafter, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issused on his estate. His widow died in Coxsackie in 1814.</p>
