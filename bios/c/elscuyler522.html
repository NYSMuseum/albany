<strong>Elsie Cuyler</strong></a> was born in August 1695. She was the daughter of <a href="jocuyler546.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../t/elstbroeck42.html">Elsie Ten Broeck</a> Cuyler. She was an older daughter in a very large family living in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of a prominent Albany leader who maintained a permanent presence in his native New York as well.

<p>In October 1724, Elsie was twenty-nine when she married <a href="../r/heroseboom1656.html">Hendrick J. Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1738, five children had been christened in Albany where she was a frequent baptism sponsor.


<p>This Roseboom family made its home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> near those of other family members. In 1736, she had been named in the <a href="../../wills/willjocuyler546.html">will</a> filed by her father. Her <a href="../c/cocuyler388.html">brother</a> was mayor of Albany during the 1740s. 

<p>Hendrick Roseboom died in October 1754, leaving Elsie a widow at the age of fifty-nine. In <a href="../../census1756.html#8">1756</a>, she was identified as the head of the household. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> valued her second ward holdings substantially. Sometimes  listed with her on the tax lists was her son, <a href="../r/joroseboom1929.html">John H. Roseboom</a>.


<p>Living at least into her seventies, Elsie Cuyler Roseboom probably was dead by the end of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence.
