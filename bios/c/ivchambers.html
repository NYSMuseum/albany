<P>Future Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ivy Chambers</strong></a> probably was born within a decade of 1750. He probably came to Albany during the 1770s. <a href="../../res/sp.html">Forms</a> of his name are common enough to keep us from answering a number of important defining <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.

<p>His wife may have been named Elizabeth. However, no material on family life in Albany has <a href="../../cbr.html">appeared</a> so far. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7580">1779</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property and holdings were valued on the city assessment roll. 

<p>Beginning in July 1779, he came under scrutiny of the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> for Detecting when he was identified as a prisoner of war and the partner of John Cobham. In August 1781, <a href="../../friends.html">T</a>ories were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXHfeDs_6DoC&pg=PA760&lpg=PA760&dq=%22ivy+chambers%22&source=bl&ots=iwTSEsa2oS&sig=kuDxUldJdBB1hKDYxkYf1C5I7yc&hl=en&ei=Nn0jTNuyDIO0lQfkh-WAAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBjge#v=onepage&q=%22ivy%20chambers%22&f=false">suspected</a> of staying at his house which was to be searched. In September, the Committee ordered him to be committed to jail and noted that Chambers wished to be exchanged. At the same time, his account was paid from the city treasury.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">1781</a>, he was among the newcomers who purchased the Freedom of the City. He was identified as a merchant.

<p>He may well have been the "Jere Chambers" who was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#cham">land bounty right</a> in conjunction withthe Albany militia regiment. 

<p>In March of 1783, the <i>New-York Gazetteer</i> advertized that near the <a href="../../im/imecourt.html">Dutch Church</a> and opposite Col. Lewis' "A Neat Assortment of Goods, broad cloth, shoe buckles, hinges, felt hats, etc. Also New Rum by the bbl, Havana sugars, etc.," This merchant would take cash or country produce. As late as April 1785, the Albany paper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA201&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7&id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ#v=onepage&q&f=false">noted</a> that Ivie Chambers, "at his store near the Low Dutch Church, on the west side of the main street, sold the usual articles of a general store, principally liquors."
 


 
<p>Ivy Chambers left no <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a>. He was dead by June 22, 1786 when letters of administration on his estate were issued to his widow.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#frch">1790</a>, a "Frances Chambers" and two other females lived in the first ward. </p>
