<P><A href="#biography"><B>Johannes Cuyler</B></A> was born in New Amsterdam about 1661. He was the eldest son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="hecuyler533.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../s/anschepmoes8629.html">Anna Schepmoes</a> Cuyler. He came to Albany with his family a few years later.</P>

          <P>Johannes followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> and 
            helped establish the Cuyler family upriver. As early as 1680, the 
            young man was leasing a bake house in Albany. In November 1684, he 
            married Albany native <a href="../t/elstbroeck42.html">Elsie Ten 
            Broeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Between 
            1685 and 1709, their twelve children were baptized in the church where 
            both parents were <a href="#church">prominent members</a>.</P>

<p>Johannes Cuyler prospered and sought  acceptance in the Albany community. His success was aided by family and marriage <a href="#connect">connections</a> back to New York City and by his willingness to serve the Albany government and the Dutch church. By the 1690s, he had taken over for his recently deceased father in the Cuyler house on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. At the same time, he also remained close to his mother who had returned to Manhattan.</p>


          <p>Prior to the establishment of Albany's <a href="../../charter.html">municipal 
            government</a> in 1686, Johannes Cuyler already had appeared before 
            the Albany court as a witness, plaintiff, and as an attorney or representative 
            for older family members. In 1687, he began a long <a href="#assoc">association</a> 
            with the new city government when he was elected assistant alderman 
            for the second <a href="../../wards.html">ward</a>. He served until 
            1698 when he was elected alderman and served until 1710. During his 
            time on the city council, he was concerned particularly with <a href="../../cia.html">Indian 
            relations</a> and the city's real estate - overseeing development 
            in Albany and <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">beyond</a>. In 1710, he 
            was appointed recorder of the city.</p>
  
<p>Johannes Cuyler also served on the provincial level. In 1705, he was elected to represent Albany in the New York General Assembly. With only two interruptions, he was elected to five terms from 1705 to 1727. In 1725, he was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany and served for a year. Over a forty-year career, Johannes held virtually every public office - some of them simultaneously.</p>

<p>Johannes Cuyler filed his <a href="../../wills/willjocuyler546.html">will</a> on November 1, 1736. It made Elsie his heir for her lifetime and then provided for his two sons and six daughters. His property included the house and lots on Pearl Street where he lived for fifty years. He died on July 20, 1740 - almost living to his eightieth birthday.</p>
