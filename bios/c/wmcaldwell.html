<P>The Albany resident known as <a href="#sources"><strong>William Caldwell</strong></a> probably was born in Albany in 1776. He was the first son in the large family of <a href="../irish.html">Sc</a>ottish emigres (by way of Philadelphia) <a href="jacaldwell7509.html">James</a> and <a href="../b/elbarnes.html">Elizabeth Barnes</a> Caldwell. In Albany for just a few years prior to William's birth, his long-lived father was an emerging businessman and entrepreneur and William was groomed to follow him at least in his Albany-based enterprises.

<p>William married Polly Walker in 1796. Their daughter was christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church in February 1799. In 1800, he first was identified as a trustee.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was assessed under the first ward holdings of "Caldwell, <a href="../vi/wmvingen1188.html">Van Ingen</a>, and Caldwell." The next year, the second ward <a href="../../census1800.html#7511">census</a> configured William's household with three boys and two girls, four men in his age group, his wife, and one slave. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">1800</a>, "grocer" William Caldwell first purchased a license from the Albany Council. By 1802, Van Ingen had died and James Caldwell left William to run the business on his own.

<p>For more than the next two decades, William Caldwell was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22caldwell+william%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22caldwell+%20william%22&f=false">prominent</a> Albany businessman whose business headquarters was at 60 State Street and who lived above the city on Washington Avenue. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, the Albany census showed only four family members living in Caldwell's household.

<p>In 1821, an Albany newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=%22william+caldwell%22+albany+retire&source=bl&ots=xs0ycit370&sig=2RYkvV7SzKZWk8NtBbTFdO93Y6U&hl=en&ei=jz7JTo-EKaje0QG75LQW&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22william%20caldwell%22%20albany%20retire&f=false">announced</a> his retirement from business. At that point, William Caldwell was forty-five years old. Over the years, Caldwell maintained his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wENJAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22william+caldwell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=CB3267uaaw&sig=fSLuukGnnKvMTIIwEYaS1UiqtRs&hl=en&ei=vDvJTuvfHOXw0gH-8LgJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCTiWAQ#v=onepage&q=%22william%20caldwell%22%20albany&f=false">connection</a> with the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> Lodge.

<p>Following the death of his father in 1829, William spent more and more time at the family home in Caldwell on Lake George.

<p>In 1831, William Caldwell was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq=%22william+caldwell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=NI9YIuDLZf&sig=LZmDEsOkOlvI-461ks83ADNDwK4&hl=en&ei=vTDJTsryG8fv0gGLoZHrDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20caldwell%22%20albany&f=false">identified</a> as a retired merchant living in Albany when he endowed an award known as the "Caldwell Mathmatical Medal" to be conferred annually on an exemplary student at the Albany Academy.

<p>William Caldwell filed a will in December of 1841. Naming his children and grandchildren as heirs, it detailed his extensive Albany holdings, property at Lake George, and personal possessions as well. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA579&lpg=PA579&dq=%22william+caldwell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=GxIaubs19g&sig=p5NdzR2bxf9h6zr4xPYeO_-9iTQ&hl=en&ei=QyDJTqPlNMPn0QGD08SkCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20caldwell%22%20albany&f=false">died</a> in April 1848 at the age of seventy-two.</p>
