      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Cuyler</strong></a> was born in 
        August 1730. She was the daughter of <a href="hecuyler530.html">Hendrick</a> 
        and <a href="../vd/mgtvdu5548.html">Margarita Van Deusen</a> Cuyler. She 
        grew up in a businessman's home on Pearl Street - a middle daughter of 
        a prominent Albany family. 
      <p>In January 1755, she married <a href="../b/hebleecker186.html">Hendrick 
        Bleecker, Jr.</a> at the Schenectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1772, six children had been christened in Albany where she was a member, 
        pewholder, and regular baptism sponsor. 
      <p>These Bleeckers lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        where Hendrick was a prominent businessman and Albany official. 
<p>Catharina lost her husband in 1787. A middle-aged widow with children still at home, she took over management of their Pearl Street <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#374">home</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#374">1790</a>, her household included son <a href="../b/hebleecker187.html">Henry</a>, three other females, and two slaves. In 1788, her account was paid by the city government. 

<p>In August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#middle">1797</a>, a great fire destroyed her stable located in Middle Lane. Two years <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">later</a>, her  personal property was valued under what had become the home of her son. 
      <p>Catharina Cuyler Bleecker died in July 1808 and was buried from her Albany church. Letters <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">of</a> administration were issued on her estate two months later.</p>
