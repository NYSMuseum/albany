<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Cuyler</b></a> was born in Hasselt, Holland in 1637. He was the son of Isbrant and Evertien Jans Cuyler.</p>

By 1660, this <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer was in New Amsterdam where he married American-born <a href="../s/anschepmoes8629.html">Anna Schepmoes</a>. Their large family established the <a href="../c/cuyler.html">Cuyler family</a> in New York and Albany.<p></p>

<p>A few years later, his family moved upriver to 
<a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he worked as a tailor and entered the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. Arriving after the initial trading boom, he enjoyed the success that often rewarded hard working <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a>.</p>

<p>In 1664, he purchased a lot in Albany and later set up his home on the south side of upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. Hendrick <a href="../../census1679.html#533">prospered</a> in Albany and was able to obtain <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> property, a patent in the Mohawk Valley, and also build a new house in New York City. In 1676, he purchased a small boat. In 1685, he was commissioned a lieutenant in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. He was named first ward alderman in 1686 and 1687. He also served as assessor and justice. An all-around community leader, he was a member and officer of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>He may have moved back to Manhattan during the late 1680s where he became a supporter of the insurgant <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/leisler/homepage.html">Jacob Leisler</a>.</p>

<p>Hendrick Cuyler filed a will in March 1690. It provided for his eight living children but left the entire estate to his wife Anna during her widowhood. The will passed probate later that Spring!</p>
