<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick A. Coster</strong></a> was born in September 1699. He was the first child born to the marriage of <a href="antcoster5968.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../t/eltbroeck38.html">Elizabeth Ten Broeck</a> Coster. He grew up in a small family in the State Street home of a prominent businessman/baker. Named for his pioneer <a href="hecoster5974.html">grandfather</a>, this sole surviving son also was referred to as "Hendrick <a href="../../res/sp.html">K</a>oster."

<p>This individual does appear to have married (at least in the Albany-based records) and to only have witnessed only one christening at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1733">1733</a>, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> for the first ward. He was re-elected for two more annual terms. However, after 1736, his name seems to have dropped from the Albany-based record.

<p>In March 1736, he was appointed commissary at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> during the trading season. The following October, his salary as commissary was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA330&lpg=PA330&dq=%22henry+koster%22+oswego&source=bl&ots=Fjsf3TidMg&sig=gkVwqzp0NDwHUbjtwzFnnVoQHK0&hl=en&ei=UGVITJavCYWclgfenvCbCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20koster%22%20oswego&f=false">ordered</a> to be paid from the provincial treasury. 

<p>In May <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA340&lpg=PA340&dq=%22hendrick+coster%22&source=bl&ots=Fjsf3TidMg&sig=gkVwqzp0NDwHUbjtwzFnnVoQHK0&hl=en&ei=UGVITJavCYWclgfenvCbCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22hendrick + coster%22&f=false">1741</a>, he was among a group of New Yorkers who unsuccessfully petitioned for a license to purchase Indian <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lands</a>. 

<p>In October 1744, he was mentioned in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wBsXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA200&lpg=PA200&dq=%22Charles+Kerr,+Doctor%22&source=bl&ots=ZGSTSru6R0&sig=SrPnJQaLoLVsILHQ3q_BjY-mxoo&hl=en&ei=5SUNTMf_AcGAlAf-3IjcDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22Charles%20Kerr%2C%20Doctor%22&f=false">will</a> filed by an Oswego-based physician. It referenced a beaver hat at Coster's house in Albany.

<p>Hendrick Coster died in September 1745 and was buried from the Dutch church in Albany.

<p> Both of his parents survived into the 1750s. With their passing, the "Coster" family name dropped from the Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a>. In June 1748, letters of administration on Coster's estate were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wBsXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA484&lpg=PA484&dq=%22hendrick+koster%22&source=bl&ots=ZGSXRoCcP-&sig=Bb2G7W3pz1V94tCZ5De1c045XzU&hl=en&ei=l1RITN74PMSqlAedya2SCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22hendrick%20koster%22&f=false">granted</a> to <a href="../vb/mgvb6658.html">Martin G. Van Bergen</a>.</p>

<p><dd>Perhaps this Hendrick Coster was one of those difficult-to-track Albany natives whose adult life transpired beyond the city (or even county) limits. At this point, we seek more resources for understanding the Albany presence at places such as <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>.
