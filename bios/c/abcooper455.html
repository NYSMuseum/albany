<strong>Abraham Cooper</strong></a> was born in February 1728. He was the son of <a href="obcooper495.html">Obadiah</a> and <a href="../g/corgardinier.html">Cornelia Gardinier</a> Cooper. He grew up in a large family in a modest home on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany . His father died in 1742 and his mother six years later - leaving him a complete orphan at the age of twenty..


<p>In March 1752, he married Catharina Ostrander of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> at the Albany <A href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1766, ten children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor. His wife may have died about the time of the birth of their last child.

</p>This tailor's son was a <a href="../../trades/weaver.html">weaver</a> and an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#202">householder</a> who was appointed constable for the first ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1755">1755</a> and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> the year after.

<p>At some time thereafter, he <a href="http://www.bluezstreet.com/FG_Cooper/FG_AbrahamCooper.htm">reportedly</a> moved out to Schodack and then to Guilderland in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manor</a>. He is said to have married Lena Van Buren in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> in June 1779.

<p>In 1766 and '67, his West bank Rensselaerswyck property was valued on Albany County <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. About that time, his name appeared on the roster of a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 

<p>We seek information on his later life and passing. </p>
