      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Glen Cuyler</strong></a> was born 
        in August 1773. He was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="abccuyler359.html">Abraham 
        C.</a> and <a href="../g/jaglen4929.html">Jannetje Glen</a> Cuyler. He 
        was <a href="../../drc.html"> christened</a> "Jacob Glen Cuyler." His 
        older brother was "<a href="../c/jacuyler541.html">Jacob A. Cuyler</a>" 
        who became an Albany resident. Yet another same-named contemporary lived 
        in Albany at that time. 
      <p>Jacob's father was the last British-appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
        of Albany. Abraham C. Cuyler remained <a href="../../friends.html">loyal</a> 
        to the crown, was apprehended by the revolutionaries, banished from New 
        York, and subsequently lost all of his substantial possessions in Albany 
        and its hinterland. 
      <p>At the start of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, his father 
        was incarcerated and the family went from exile in New York City to Canada 
        where Abraham C. Cuyler re-established his position and died in 1810. 
      <p>In 1789, Jacob was among several family members <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~macfie/townsend.htm">compensated</a> 
        for their American losses by the British with land in Canada. 
      <p>Family tradition holds that the elder Cuyler was able to purchase commissions 
        for his sons in the British army in 1799. In 1806, Jacob Glen Cuyler was 
        a captain in the 59th Regiment of infantry when it sailed from England 
        to South Africa. Later, he was known as "General" Cuyler. 
      <p> In October 1808, he is said to have married Maria Elizabeth Hartman 
        of South Africa. They had at least four children. 
      <p>He settled on a large farm and was one of the founders of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uitenhage">Uitenhage</a>, 
        a town in the East Cape district of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_South_Africa">Albany</a>. 
        The farm museum <a href="http://www.southafrica.info/plan_trip/holiday/culture_heritage/179904.htm#uitenhage">survives</a> 
        today. Favored by government <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wmr0sB9HwRgC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=%22jacob+glen+cuyler%22&source=web&ots=wJ2mowG_Ks&sig=p3x5M9AU_Joa3YCSBbB_Sw0mJB8&hl=en">preferment</a>, 
        he became a prominent landholder and developer. 
      <p>According to a <a href="http://www.genealogyworld.net/settlers/eastern.html">newspaper</a> 
        obituary, "General Jacob Glen Cuyler died at his residence, Cuyler Manor, 
        near Uitenhage,on Friday, the 14th April [1854]." </p>
