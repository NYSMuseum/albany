<P>With both <a href="../../res/sp.html">names</a> spelled and referenced variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Roelof Cole</strong></a> was christened at the Albany Dutch church in May 1750. He was the son of <a href="lacole7666.html">Lambert</a> and <a href="../k/makid5992.html">Maria Kidney</a> Cole. He probably was named for his mother's <a href="../k/rokid5999.html">father</a>. His parents raised a small family in a modest first ward home. Perhaps his father had passed on by March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7666">1779</a> when the holdings of "Widow L. Cole" were valued modestly on the Albany assessment role.

<p>"Roelof" first occasioned notice in October 1773, when he was sworn in and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA252&lpg=PA252&dq=%22roeloff+cole%22&source=bl&ots=wygKdQzcmx&sig=nqMRdnhS1tTohvXnx0EZW2sjjQ0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMItuzMwf6MxwIVBjk-Ch3iGwBE#v=onepage&q=%22roeloff%20cole%22&f=false">examined</a> by the the city Council regarding his eligibility to vote. That enquiry provides unusual insight on his background. Although he had been born in Albany, had lived in the third ward, had been up to "Missilunama," (perhaps <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=missisquoi+settlement&source=bl&ots=ALQO7hjD_U&sig=LHY3if5l50fJXUCL7ZvoMu0bAGg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgKahUKEwiCmPvOpY3HAhUGPD4KHctdAHs#v=onepage&q=missisquoi%20settlement&f=false">Missiquoi</a> - lands associated with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missisquoi_River">tributary</a> of northern Lake Champlain) and had lived with his father in the first ward,  he had not lived in one place for the requisite six weeks, and thus was denied a vote.

      <p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1774">1774</a>, he was appointed constable 
        for the third ward. However, two months later he had <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA268&lpg=PA268&dq=%22rolieff+cole%22&source=bl&ots=wygKdXA9lr&sig=zF96kS6WKjdyX1ZkEI0kNa7trOU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIma6I6oWPxwIVhlU-Ch2Q-wBQ#v=onepage&q=%22rolieff%20cole%22&f=false">left 
        Albany</a> and was to be replaced. In January <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA269&lpg=PA269&dq=%22reliff+cole%22&source=bl&ots=wygKdXAbgr&sig=9peOq0NAXkgkS9bmL3kH8FkPQGU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIp9jbsYaPxwIVyTc-Ch1kbwQ4#v=onepage&q=%22reliff%20cole%22&f=false">1775</a>, 
        he was disqualified from serving in Albany. After that, his name no longer 
        has been found in an <a href="../../res/context.html">Albany context</a>. 
      <p><a href="../../marriages.html">Ma</a>rriage and family information for him has not been encountered in the extant records of Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 

<p>In his mid-twenties at the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, we expect to encounter information on the subsequent life of Albany native Roelof Cole. However, our most recent sweeps have not yielded additional material. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, only the large household of "Lambert Cole" in the town of Livingston, Columbia County appeared on the first census in New York State.

<p>With questions regarding his adult life and passing unanswered, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
