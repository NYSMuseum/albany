<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Cuyler</strong></a> was born in August 1731. She was the daughter of <a href="cocuyler388.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../s/caschuyler1244.html">Catharina Schuyler</a> Cuyler. She grew up in the large family of a second ward businessman who would be appointed mayor of Albany in 1742. Her younger sister, <a href="elscuyler523.html">Elsie</a>, married Augustus Van Cortlandt but died in 1761. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22james+van+cortlandt%22+family+cuyler&ei=prhcWrfgII3ZzwKH3qvQBw&start=10&sa=N&biw=1600&bih=769">Family</a>-based <a href="../../res/ts.html">res</a>ources sometimes confuse and conflate the similarly named sisters.

<p>In 1752, Elizabeth married an older James (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Jac</a>obus) Van Cortlandt. Apparently childless, the couple took up <a href="http://www.vchm.org/the-history-of-van-cortlandt-house-and-family.html">residence</a> in the Bronx <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Wg1IAQAAMAAJ&pg=PR10&lpg=PR10&dq=%22james+van+cortlandt%22&source=bl&ots=gs90Fe2jdZ&sig=megW_7D-pQNZOyNpWt8caAgeA5I&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1-fzHt4zYAhVDKyYKHUkGDnU4ChDoAQguMAI#v=onepage&q=%22james%20van%20cortlandt%22&f=false">mansion</a> James had inherited from his father - although his mother also lived there until her death in 1780.</p>

      <p>At one point, Elizabeth was a pewholder in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. But, by 1760, she was no longer in Albany and the pew was 
        transferred to the daughter of a <a href="../b/jojabeekman3866.html">ne</a>ighbor. 
        In March 1765, Elizabeth was among those <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">bequeathed</a> 
        a share of her father's substantial estate. 
      <p>We seek information on their life <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=apRYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PR21&lpg=PR21dq=%22james+van+cortlandt%22&source=bl&ots=LYsTbZ5vGf&sig=awZrian_Z8z4G92o0lONtqfZuVA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs59HeodrYAhUD1lMKHRN6DmU4ChDoAQg5MAU#v=onepage&q=%22james%20van%20cortlandt%22&f=false">and</a> residency during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for American Independence.

<p>Elizabeth lost her husband in 1781. Called Colonel, <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mateox/8057299940">sources</a> hold that James Van Cortlandt had been a Patriot leader and army officer. His <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Nfw2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA266&lpg=PA266&dq=will+of+%22james+van+cortlandt%22&source=bl&ots=r1j_ks3t7G&sig=wuZMg7jGHXWmKYZ3Y3jYj6Ir5nY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOhYezptrYAhWJzlMKHYFMDkMQ6AEIQDAF#v=onepage&q=will%20of%20%22james%20van%20cortlandt%22&f=false">will</a> ostensibly dated March 1781 may have left her his property. As we have not identified the widow as head of her own household, perhaps she then resided within a larger Cuyler or Van Cortlandt household.

<p>In February 1782, she was identified as the widow of James Van Cortlandt and left a bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willmgtschuyler1488.html">will</a> of a legendary <a href="../s/mgtschuyler.html">Schuyler</a> matron.

<p>Elizabeth Cuyler is <a href="https://www.myheritage.com/names/elizabeth_cuyler">said</a> to have <a href="#life">died</a> in 1815 at the age of 83.
