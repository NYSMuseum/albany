<strong>Alexander Cammeron</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> Cameron) probably was born before 1756. After the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he settled in Albany in a modest house as part of a Scottish enclave living along the Schenectady <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a> above the settled part of the city. 

<p>At the same time, it appears that a <a href="http://www.google.com/archivesearch?hl=en&q=alexander-cameron&um=1&ie=UTF-8&scoring=t&ei=RnykSYOgIpDZnQem6dWdBQ&sa=X&oi=timeline_result&resnum=11&ct=title">number</a> of individuals named Alexander Cameron were active in New York and its environs during the second half of the eighteenth century. Caution is the watchword here!

<p>In November 1777, Alexander married Margaret Murray at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. So far, we have not encountered additional references in the records of the church. However, their marriage did produce children who lived in their Albany home.

<p>The first name on the city assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7512">1788</a> was that of Alexander Cammeron who owned a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> above the settled part of the city. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7512">1790</a>, this household was configured on the first ward census. A decade later, his <a href="../../census1800.html#7512">home</a> included two young children and a younger adult.

<p>In August 1802, Alexander Cammeron was listed on the first ward municipal <a href="../../poor.html">poor</a> roll. In 1799, his wife had been included as well.

<p>Beginning in 1813, an Alexander Cammeron was listed in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA59,M1">city directory</a> as a silversmith. That individual probably was not the recent pauper.</p>
