<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Campbell</strong></a> lived in Albany <a href="../../or/or-eb.html">after</a> the Revolution. He was married to <a href="../qqqq.html#one">a</a> woman <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as "Chloe." John Campbell was dead by January 1802 when his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a>. Several same-named individuals were active (four Campbell-named households were identified on the census in 1790) in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a> during that time. We seek more definitive information on this John's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 


<p>Was he the John Campbell who was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willarcampbell.html">will</a> filed by <a href="arcampbell7528.html">Archibald Campbell</a> of Albany in February 1793? If so, his mother was <a href="../s/chstarenberg.html">Christina Starenberg</a> formerly of Schoharie. However, this Albany resident does not appear to have been <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Presbyterian plot with the others connected to Archibald.

<p>At this point, we begin to move forward noting that in <a href="../../census1790.html#7536">1790</a> he was identified as a householder on the census for the second ward.</p>


      <p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#clca">1800</a>, the household of "Clowe" 
        Campbell was configured on the census of the first ward. In 1800, two 
        more same-named individuals were listed on the census for Albany and Watervliet. 
      <p>In January 1802, letters of administration were issued to "wife Chloe" and two daughters - but no sons noted. 

      <p>With so many individuals at-risk in Albany and its environs, we hesitate to 
        assign additional qualitative information and must move on for now. <br>
