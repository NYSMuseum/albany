<strong>Jacob Cooper</strong></a> was was born  in April 1726. He was the son of <a href="obcooper495.html">Obadiah</a> and <a href="../g/corgardinier.html">Cornelia Gardinier</a> Cooper. He grew up in a large family in the home of a soldier-turned-tailor on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany.</P>

<p>About 1747, he married <a href="../o/joorchard469.html">Josina Orchard</a> (Archer). By 1768, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>He was a <a href="../../census1756.html#180">baker</a> who was appointed to service positions (constable and firemaster) beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1748">1748</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#485">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. The next year, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> of his Southside neighbor. In 1767, his first ward property was valued on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">assessment roll</a>. 

<p>As early as 1766, he was <a href="http://www.savethepinebush.org/News/04MayJune/HighPoint.html">leasing</a> a farm located 
west of Albany.  At that time, he also was a member of a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In his fifties at the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional resources have called him actively "antiTory."  Identified in 1780 as "of the Helderbergs," he thwarted thieves who attempted to rob his house. The Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Board</a> met at his house on at least one occasion. Later, he was granted a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Third Regiment of the Albany County militia.

<p>By the end of the war, he had re-located permanently to the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>/New Scotland property. In 1790, his household was configured on the Watervliet <a href="../../census1790.html#485">census</a>.

<P>Jacob Cooper lived until 1813. His will passed probate in June. He had lived more than eighty-seven years.</p>
