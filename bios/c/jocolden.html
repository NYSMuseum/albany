<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>John Colden</strong></a> was born in May 1729. Perhaps, he was perhaps the third son <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XN0UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=%22john+colden%22+cadwallader&source=bl&ots=56-h9L-hpi&sig=ti3rtWD5V9L5fFmHkX-TDVv-x9o&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEoQ6AEwDWoVChMI1bej07HYxgIVDNOACh2RqQAS#v=onepage&q=%22john%20colden%22%20cadwallader&f=false">among</a> the eight surviving children of Dr. <a href="#cc">Cadwallader Colden</a> and Alice <a href="../../res/sp.html">Ch</a>ristie Colden. His <a href="../irish.html">Scots-Irish</a> father was a physician, botanist, surveyor, acting royal governor, and among the most outstanding personages to inhabit colonial New York. John's formative years were spent in New York City and at the family's upriver estate called <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0wNu1NzSxCsC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22manorial+estate+coldenham%22&source=bl&ots=iD4P3blCI_&sig=chn7HCHVHjNvwqCRo_5mcFZdlao&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIpJT6y7PYxgIVQYwNCh3xWQCw#v=onepage&q=%22manorial%20estate%20coldenham%22&f=false">Colden[g]ham</a>.  

<p>All of Cadwallader Colden's adult children followed their father's career paths but as individual pieces of the elder Colden's substantial career mosaic. In November 1748, John was appointed <a href="http://www.mocavo.co.uk/Collections-of-the-New-York-Historical-Society-for-the-Year-1920-Letters-and-Papers-of-Cadwallader-Colden-Volume-53/864783/95">storekeeper</a> to the garrison in New York. Due to his father's <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Gng9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA94&lpg=PA94&dq=%22john+clerk&source=bl&ots=24XWSuCxjP&sig=N5AERfIRDpgs9NIQMcQuOwhjGBs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwBWoVChMIha7dhoHgxgIVgT8-Ch1uLwyz#v=onepage&q=%22john%20clerk%20&f=false">agency</a>, in February 1749 he was commissioned <a href="../../corporation.html#clerk">Clerk</a> of the City and County of Albany to replace the recently deceased <a href="../l/phlivingston86.html">Philip Livingston</a>. In March 1749, he carried a letter from his father informing <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> of the appointment and asking Johnson to mentor young John. In early June, John <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rNkTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA481&lpg=PA481&dq=%22john+colden%22&source=bl&ots=NR3Fso3cGY&sig=pyoTWA4hn3Ues-0W4ziHdhNNTnc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BYGiVd_AF8uhgwTr1LHwBg&ved=0CFIQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20colden%22&f=false">wrote</a> to his father apprising him of the situation in Albany. In July 1749, his father ordered law  <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Letters-and-Papers-of-Cadwallader-Colden-1711-1775-Volume-68-Part-9/881970/51#52">books</a> and other volumes from England his son had requested for his library. The elder Colden also sought out <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dKBKSiIICH8C&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=%22john+colden%22+clerk&source=bl&ots=tZfFQuMDm1&sig=LPdPcVQzGuNXREzhU_N6cDnygqs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCcQ6AEwA2oVChMI_4CmuoPgxgIVxBw-Ch2tew_m#v=onepage&q=%22john%20colden%22%20clerk&f=false">guidance</a> for his son in the clerk's office. While in Albany, John would stay in the home of Dr. <a href="../r/jaroseboom1665.html">Jacob Roseboom</a>. Colden was re-appointed Albany clerk in April of 1750 and promptly <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yhlJAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=%22john+colden%22+clerk&source=bl&ots=RqvwDnJkXJ&sig=GlwYdbgDNtRlijiS3wwSoz_BfhQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBGoVChMI_4CmuoPgxgIVxBw-Ch2tew_m#v=onepage&q=%22john%20colden%22%20clerk&f=false">certified</a> the "Indian deed" for <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lands</a> submitted by <a href="../l/jhlydius4615.html">John H. Lydius</a>.

<p>Over the course of his short adult life, John was in frequent contact with his famous father. Those extensive <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Letters-and-Papers-of-Cadwallader-Colden-1711-1775-Volume-68-Part-9/881970/17">letters</a> in 1748-50 shed light on the Albany scene and involve his interactions with local officials and <a href="../../trades/law.html">att</a>orneys - particularly his difficulties with <a href="../c/ecollins.html">Edward Collins</a>. Although John Colden's Albany tenure lasted less than two years, his correspondence reveals a closer connection  on a number of levels between Albany and New York than has been previously understood.
 
<p>Without much warning, John Colden <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Letters-and-Papers-of-Cadwallader-Colden-1711-1775-Volume-68-Part-9/881970/90">died</a> at Albany on August 21, 1750. He had lived just twenty-one years. In the months that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Gng9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254&dq=%22john+death&source=bl&ots=24XWSuCxjP&sig=N5AERfIRDpgs9NIQMcQuOwhjGBs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC8Q6AEwBWoVChMIha7dhoHgxgIVgT8-Ch1uLwyz#v=onepage&q=%22john%20death&f=false">followed</a>, his father <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Letters-and-Papers-of-Cadwallader-Colden-1711-1775-Volume-68-Part-9/881970/94">would rely</a> on <a href="../s/jastevenson3901.html">James Stevenson</a> (who had served as deputy clerk in the past) and Dr. Roseboom to assist in settling John's Albany affairs.</p>

<p><a name=cc></a>Until recently, <b>Cadwallader Colden</b> (1688-1776) had no modern, critical biography. Over his long career, he was an important influence on the Albany scene in a number of ways. Begin with: Seymour I. Schwartz, <a href="http://www.prometheusbooks.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=2202"><i>Cadwallader Colden: A Biography</i></a> (2013). For more on the elder Colden, see his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadwallader_Colden">Wikipedia</a> entry; <a href="http://famousamericans.net/cadwalladercolden/">Famous Americans</a> for an <a href="../../res/ts.html">antiquarian</a> past; also the <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Colden,_Cadwallader_(DNB00)"><i>DNB</i></a> entry. In his Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>, he is chiefly remembered for his criticism of Albany's motives.
