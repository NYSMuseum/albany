<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Louisa Crane</strong></a> was born about 1785. Subsequent <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/CRAIN/1998-05/0896289922">information</a> identifies her as the daughter of <a href="elcrane.html">Elisha Crane</a> and perhaps Ruth Phelps. Her father recently had re-located from New Jersey and Ruth may have been his second wife. These Cranes set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where their household totalled nine members in <a href="../../census1790.html#7713">1790</a>. 

<p>In April 1804, she <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&pg=PA640&lpg=PA640&dq=%22louisa+crane%22+orlando&source=bl&ots=_sKiMMyxCj&sig=XKI67S7-MB9owgq-ku2xmIBi7Ew&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BTHCT56oIrGK6QHut73YCg&ved=0CF4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22louisa%20crane%22%20orlando&f=false">married</a> English-born newcomer "<a href="../m/jomeads.html">John Mead</a>" at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal Church. The marriage produced many children. A number of them became Albany residents.  <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra Ames</a> produced paintings of the couple in 1816. Her <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ecDZkmBJmocC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=louisa+%22john++meads%22&source=bl&ots=uApOX9iPPh&sig=GQrD5SvS3nDPN_haSuopVDhPvLg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VjLCT66mGfOe6wHY962rDg&sqi=2&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=louisa%20%22john%20%20meads%22&f=false">portrait</a> is part of the <a href="http://collections.si.edu/search/results.htm?q=record_ID:siris_ari_370701">collection</a> of Albany Institute of History and Art which also <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/furniture/chest_dr.htm">includes</a> fine furnishings fashioned by her husband and later her brother.

<p>The couple first raised their family in a landmark <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#first">home</a> on Market Street and later in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jzM8wF0vWdQC&pg=PA313&lpg=PA313&dq=%22john+meads%22&source=bl&ots=yhO5Ifq5D4&sig=9gTmD_0QuSejnDb8nBg1AfP3fVE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pr6vT-jsN4bG6AGe5OCWCQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22john%20meads%22&f=false">townhouse</a> Meads had built on upper Columbia Street.

<p>During the 1830s, the heirs of Elisha Crane began the <a href="../../or/pension/penelcrane.html">process</a> of applying for a pension for his service during the American Revolution. Louisa's name was prominent in the applications as she was the only heir still living by the end of the process.


 
<p>Louisa Crane Meads died in late January 1854. The "wife of John Meads" was said to have been sixty-nine years of age. Meads lived five years longer.</p>
