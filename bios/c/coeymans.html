<P>In its Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>, the <a href="#sources"> <strong>Coeymans family</strong></a> of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and then of southern Albany County had some members who fit our <a href="../../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion. However, they were most prominent as regional landholders <a href="../../na/na.html">south of Albany</a> later focused by <a href="../../res/realestate.html">farm lands</a> in a provincial grant that would become known as the <a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans Patent</a>.

<p>Perhaps the seminal family member in America appears to have been one <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Coeymans-29">Pieter Barents</a> (perhaps 1590 to 1639 or <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Pieter-Coeymans/6000000009412674644">later</a>). The Coeymans connection to early <a href="../../earlycity.html">Albany</a> begins with the arrival of one <a href="bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieterse</a> and perhaps his brothers and father - <a href="../../res/ts.html">maybe</a> as early as 1639. Although he primarily identified as a resident of <a href="../../census1697.html#6155">Rensselaerswyck</a>, his long life spanned the initial settlement of Albany and its <a href="../../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a>. Following his passing, in 1712 his extensive holdings <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">devolved</a> to his sons and <a href="geercoey241.html">daughter</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, three sons (Andries, Barent, and <a href="sacoeymans.html">Samuel</a>) of Barent Pieterse were listed on the countywide freeholders <a href="http://genealogy-quest.com/1720-county-albany-new-york-rensselaerswyck/">list</a> for Rensselaerswyck. These spelling variant of the surname (Coeyeman, Koeymans, Cojeman, Kojeman, Coeymans) appear in the records of the Albany         <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> for that time.

      <p>During the 1740s, <a href="gerrcoeymans.html">Gerritje Coeymans</a> - daughter 
        of the abovementioned Pieter, married her neighbor John Barclay. She died 
        in 1753 and was "buried at her father's house." Barclay then relocated 
        to the city of Albany where he remarried in 1771. He was named first mayor 
        of Albany under New York State in 1777. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#rw">1742</a>, a countywide list included Pieter and Samuel as freeholders in Rensselaerswyck.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, an inventory of Albany dwellings taken by the British army included two references that may represent the Coeymans name. <a href="../qqqq.html#one">One</A> referenced the house of one "<a href="../../census1756.html#87">Mrs. Th. Quemay</a>" while the other "identified" the property of a "<a href="../../census1756.html#218">Caternankee Quimay</a>." These individuals remain <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzling</a> as we search for the precise identity and origins of those mid-century city householders.

<p>A unique compilation of <a hrf="../../guide/histres.html#ss">survey</a> resources entitled <i><a href="../../sources.html#uny">Upstate New York</a></i> references several family members among the prominent inhabitants of the upriver region. Only "Widow Coeymans" whose Albany holdings (probably in the elite part of the first ward) in <a href="#con">conjunction</a> with "Widow (Margriet) Ten Eyck" were considered on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> for 1766 and 1767 represented the family name in the city. Their relatively high assessments ranked them among the elite Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">res</a>idents.

<p>Available tax rolls for 1779 <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">and</a> 1788 list no family members as city property holders. 

<p>The first Federal census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> does not seem to have counted any (all <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelling variants</a>) Coeymans headed households in New York State.

<p>Today, the Coeymans name is <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=coeymans&spf=1497972174669">prominent</a> in the iconography of greater Albany County. However, actual Coeymans-named inhabitants are less so! 	  

<p>A modern <a href="https://lp.myheritage.com/last-name/data-3?tr_account=975-302-5050&utm_source=ppc_google&utm_campaign=mh_search_us_en_des_sup_phrase_lastnames-noname-haswidget&tr_ad_group=adgroup07&tr_brand=1&research_last_name=coeyman&lang=&keyword=&tr_size=&tr_camp_id=759520760&tr_ag_id=45597987008&tr_network=g&tr_keyword=coeyman&tr_placement=&tr_matchtype=p&tr_position=1o1&tr_creative=184832246151&tr_device=c&tr_device_model=&tr_extension_id=&tr_target_id=kwd-40438660521&tr_location=9004684&tr_placement_target=&gclid=CJ6-i4PczNQCFdyKswodZ_sNPw">visualization</a> of the prevalence of the family name in the United States offers an interesting and at least for me, surprising scenario.

<p><a name=con></a><b>Widow Coeymans and Widow Margaret Ten Eyck</b>: The identities of both these individuals point to several possibilities for each woman. In June 2017, and after lengthy consideration, we are exercising caution by <a href="../qqqq.html">refraining</a> from making definitive identifying commitments for either of them.
