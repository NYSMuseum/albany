<P>According to marriage records, <a href="#sources"><b>Edward Carbet</b></a> was born in England. On November 26, 1699, he was in Albany when he married <a href="../p/mapost2221.html">Maria Post</a>, the widow of Jan Bradt. As his bride was older than fifty, the marriage produced no children!</p>

<p>In January 1700, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">identified</a> as the "city carter." In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">1701</a>, he signed a petition to the royal govenor pledging loyalty and asking for protection. The other 175 signers were from Albany County.  </p>

<p>Edward Carbet's first ward property was assessed on the city tax list in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7704">1709</a>. His house was located in an enclave of former soldiers and south of the house of <a href="../r/jrosie.html">Jan Rosie</a>.</p>

<p>After 1709, his name dropped from Albany annals!</p>
