<strong>Elizabeth Cooper</strong></a> was born in August 1724. She was an older daughter in the very large family of newcomers <a href="obcooper495.html">Obediah</a> and <a href="../g/corgardinier.html">Cornelia Gardinier</a> Cooper. She grew up on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany among other families of former soldiers. Her father died in 1742 and her mother in 1748.

<p>In May 1744, she married <a href="../l/ablansing3692.html">Abraham Jac. Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1762, the marriage had produced eleven children. Their names followed traditional family naming practices.

<p>These Lansings lived for a time in Albany. During the 1760s, her husband acquired a farm above Albany and on the eastern side of the Hudson River. There, he founded a "New City" that became the village of <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>. The family was living there by the time Abraham Jacobse Lansing died - probably in the summer of 1780.

<p>After that, Elizabeth most likely went to live with her children or with other kin in Dutchess County. 

<p>Elizabeth filed a <a href="../../wills/willelcooper477.html">will</a> in September 1780. It stated that she was late of Albany, a widow, and weak in body. Her will passed probate in April 1783. Elizabeth Cooper Lansing had lived almost fifty-nine years.</p>
