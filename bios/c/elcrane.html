<P>According to subsequent <a href="../../or/pension/penelcrane.html">information</a>, Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Elisha Crane</strong></a> was  born in October 1756. He was a native of Newark, New Jersey and was living there when he enlisted in the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary army. However, a number of same-named individuals appear to be
 <a href="../../res/guess.html">at risk</a> in the American Northeast.

<p>He appears to have been a soldier during the war. Later, his heirs <a href="../../or/pension/penelcrane.html">applied</a> for a pension. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> particulars of his wartime activities.

<p>He seems to have arrived in Albany sometime in 1779. His holdings were not found on the Albany assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">March</a>. However, beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October 1779</a>, his properties ("Mr. Crane with son-in-law" and a second entry for only Elisha Crane) were valued on Albany assessment rolls. 

<p>In January 1781, he married Ruth <a href="../../res/sp.html">Ph</a>elps at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps, that was his second marriage as his older <a href="locrane.html">daughter</a> would marry a newcomer cabinetmaker in Albany in 1804. No children from Crane's second marriage were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=unTmfLoFhGwC&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22elisha+crane%22+albany&source=bl&ots=CLn3J3ltzf&sig=7mb57j6mQzNvq0WuTm3BhLuNJl0&hl=en&ei=HBfcTIyJFYLGlQfy-sjNCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCEQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&q=%22elisha%20crane%22%20albany&f=false">1781</a>, he was acting as an agent for the Albany-based operations of <a href="../d/wmduer.html">William Duer</a>.

      <p>During the 1780s, Crane was an Albany merchant with a number of partners including 
        John Batchelor (they "purchased" city docks in 1785), and with Douglass 
        & Hitchcock. Beginning in February 1783, the <i>New-York Gazetteer</i> 
        and other papers advertised that he sold candles and soap (by wholesale 
        or retail) and cider opposite the <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">city 
        hall</a>. 
      <p>In 1786, he signed a small note which later became due to the <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#7713">estate</a> of Dr. Henry Van Dyck. In October of that year, his account was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=%22elisha+crane%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0SqpssJrBn&sig=9RTsD3sKJASiQUdXy6BFOUxN7RY&hl=en&ei=MBXcTKjuFYSBlAe9w-iKCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22elisha%20crane%22%20albany&f=false">paid</a> out of the city treasury.
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7713">1788</a>, his first ward house and holdings were valued on the Albany assessment roll. 

<p>In December 1790, his Albany "dwelling house" was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyschoha/newsgleanings.html">identified</a> as a polling place.

<p>In <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyschoha/newsgleanings.html">February 1791</a>, a drawing for lots in the far reaches of Rensselaerswyck (closer to Schoharie) was to be held at Crane's Albany dwelling house. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7713">1790</a>, his first ward home included three men, two boys, and four females. In  <a href="../../census1800.html#7713">1800</a>, the census showed his household in the same general location with four children and an older couple. By 1810, Elisha Crane's Albany household consisted only of an older couple and four free people of <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">color</a>.

<p>Perhaps early in 1794, the convicted arsonist slave <a href="../slave/pomp.html">Pomp</a> confessed that he had stolen mail (postal) from Elisha Crane's house.

<p>In <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html">1794</a>, he was among those who subscribed to support the founding of Union College. 

<p>Probably, it was his son and namesake who was in the furniture business with <a href="../m/jomeads.html">John Meads</a> during the 1800s.

<p>In May 1808, he was identified as "my worthy friend Elisha Crane or his heirs" and was bequeathed "all my property in Albany" in the <a href="http://luzernereader.tripod.com/solomonjohnson.htm">will</a> of <a href="../j/sojohnson.html">Solomon Johnson</a> of Pennsylvania.

<p>Albany resident Elisha Crane died in February 1811 leaving a widow and three surviving children. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22crane+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22crane%20widow%22&f=false">1813</a>, the household of grocer and widow Lydia Crane at 154 Court Street was one of three Cranes listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">Albany Directory</a>. However, these Cranes may not have been the family of this Elisha Crane.

      <p>In 1839, Orlando Meads wrote a <a href="../../or/pension/penelcrane.html">letter 
        of inquiry</a> regarding his grandfather's pension application which seems 
        to have been filed during the 1830s. Awaiting further <a href="../qqqq.html">clarification</a> 
        of his pension scenario, we move on for now!</p>
