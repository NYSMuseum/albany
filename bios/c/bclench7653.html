<strong>Benjamin V. Clench</strong></a> was born about 1764. He was the second son of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> innkeepers Robert <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=esVErDx6YToC&pg=RA1-PA503&lpg=RA1-PA503&dq=%22robert+clench%22+schenectady&source=bl&ots=B7ShcswtuF&sig=ukXarwITJapIDzs14z3b1DxZ_vU&hl=en&ei=QNcvSrznHYvGM5XizfIJ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5">and</a> Hannah Vernon (<a href="../v/mavernor8410.html">V</a>ernor) Clench. Like his older brother, he was named yet effectively barred from inheritence in the <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/ny/albany/wills/other/clench-robert.txt">will</a> filed by his father in September 1781. Robert Clench was dead by the end of the year. Benjamin's <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2808">brother</a> was a notable Tory. 

<p>By 1790, he had married Albany native <a href="../s/mashepard.html">Mary Shepard</a>. Beginning in that year, their children were christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church where both parents were lifelong members. In March 1794, he was named in the will filed by his <a href="../s/wmshep1155.html">father-in-law</a>. 

<p>Perhaps his budding family was included under the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household of his father-in-law on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#1155">1790</a>. A decade later, his household at the same location was <a href="../../census1800.html#7653">configured</a> on the Albany census. Assessment rolls valued his holdings modestly.

<p>During those years, he was an Albany mainstay - juror, fireman, <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">bank director</a>, and attendant at community <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#7653">events</a>. He was known as an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22clench,+benjamin%22+editor&source=bl&ots=2hLtKZXz3A&sig=9NTru5Wrei0KFns50SW-7HNQkNY&hl=en&ei=Mw4cSpuJFo3KM46L0JoP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6">auctioneer</a> with an address of 88 State Street and then at 94 North Pearl.


<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=clench&source=bl&ots=xr2B9ov50V&sig=XJ_iwUo1m0mkqbEFzw_eZENuvks&hl=en&ei=GbAuSo76MIqqNY7rhYEK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#PPA135,M1">1819</a> and in April 1820, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA145&lpg=PA145&dq=clench&source=bl&ots=xr2B9ov50V&sig=XJ_iwUo1m0mkqbEFzw_eZENuvks&hl=en&ei=GbAuSo76MIqqNY7rhYEK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#PPA145,M1">identified</a> in the newspaper as an auctioneer along with a number of other Albany businessmen.

<p>In December 1822, a <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany08munsuoft/annalsofalbany08munsuoft_djvu.txt">fire</a> destroyed a row of buildings on South Market Street owned by Clench and <a href="../c/jacaldwell7509.html">James Caldwell</a>.

<p>Mary Clench passed on in February 1834 and was buried in the St. Peter's cemetery plot. Benjamin V. Clench died in May 1837 at the age of seventy-three.
