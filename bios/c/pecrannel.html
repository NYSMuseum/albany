      <br>
      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter Crannel</strong></a> was born in January 
        1732. He was the son of <a href="wmcrannel7721.html">William</a> and <a href="../b/mgtben7315.html">Margarita 
        Benoit</a> Crannel. He grew up as a middle child in the home of a first 
        ward city family. His father passed on in 1757. 
      <P>By 1758, he had married Catrina Egmont, the youngest daughter of the <a href="../e/jaegmont7919.html">late</a> city bellman. Their first child was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in October. By 1771, at least four more children had been baptized in Albany. The parents were occasional baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1757">1757</a>, he was elected constable for the first ward. But, in March 1759, he was removed from that office as he had "entered service." However, we have yet to find information on a possible military record during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>.

<p>In 1766 <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">and</a> '67, his property in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">M</a>anor north of the city was assessed modestly.

<p>In <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=bZAbAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA809&lpg=PA809&dq=crannel&source=bl&ots=nD_8CAQkLq&sig=rWgPFWZb1ttzR0zbPQmsSRcp_Ds&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PqHxT6eOFqfX6wG4_8yeBg&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=crannel&f=false"">1767</a>, his name appeared on the roster of a Rensselaerswyck militia company.

<p>After that, his name was no longer part of the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#dcp">available</a> community-based record.

<p>In 1793, he (or his heirs) owed a small sum to the <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#7718">estate</a> of the late William Charles.

<p>With a number of outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the life of Albany native Peter Crannel, we move on for now! </p>
