<P><a href="#sources"><b>Obadiah Cooper</b></a> was one-time soldier who settled in Albany during the second decade of the eighteenth century. He is <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/albrecht/messages/663.html">said</a> to have been born in Dutchess County about 1690.</p>

<p>In September 1714, he was identified as a private in Captain <a href="../m/pematthews.html">Peter Matthews'</a> company and on duty at Catskill and Coxsackie. By that time he had married Kinderhook native 
<a href="../g/corgardinier.html">Cornelia Gardinier</a>. Beginning in 1718, the last nine of their twelve children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

      <p>In 1718, Cooper began to acquire land on the south side of Albany in an area 
        recently settled by former <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> 
        soldiers. He was listed as a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
        resident on the voter lists of <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#495">1720</a> 
        and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#495">1742</a>. Traditional sources refer to him as a "tailor." </p>

<p>Obadiah Cooper died in 1742 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church on May sixth.</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Obadiah <a href="cooper.html">Cooper</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography

        Descendants</i> (privately published, 1946). An <a href="http://www.hinesite.accessgenealogy.com/cooper.htm">online 
        genealogy</a> (thru twelve generations) provides interesting (but conflicting) 
        background information. We seek defining information on his background!</font></p>
