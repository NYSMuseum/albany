<strong>Elizabeth Cuyler</strong></a> was born in September 1726. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="hecuyler530.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vd/mgtvdu5548.html">Margarita Van Deusen</a> Cuyler. She grew up in a merchant's home located in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<P>She probably did not marry. But, in 1754, she was identified as a pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. On several occasions afterward, she was listed in church rolls as a baptism sponsor. 

<p>In March 1761, she was thirty-five-years-old when she named in the <a href="../../wills/willhecuyler530.html">will</a> of her father and was provided for while she was unmarried and also in the event that she did marry. Hendrick Cuyler died in 1765 and Elizabeth's mother lived on as the head of their <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home where thirty-nine-year-old Elizabeth probably lived as well.   

<p>After she witnessed a baptism in July 1773, the name of Elizabeth Cuyler dropped from Albany rolls.</p>
