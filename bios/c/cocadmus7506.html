<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelius Cadmus</strong></a> probably was born during the 1720s. We have yet to <a href="../../res/origins.html">connect</a> him to the Cadmus <a href="http://www.getnj.com/hudberg/genealogical212.shtml">family</a> of New Jersey.

<p>In July 1744, Cornelius <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cadmus">C</a>admus <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/church/rdcmarr1744.shtml">marr</a>ied "Maria Umble" at the Dutch church in New York City.

<p>At some time after that, Cadmus and his wife became <a href="../../criteria.html">residents</a> of Albany.

<p>In August 1764, Cornelius Cadmus was <a href="../../res/ts.html">id</a>entified as a "tavernkeeper for Schuyler at the Flatts" and on at least two occasions was paid from the Ten Eyck account book.

<p>Beginning in 1766 (<font size=-1>and infrequently but until January 1785</font size>), Cornelis and Maria were witnessing baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In December 1772, Albany Dutch church communicants Hendrick and Jacomyntie Crannel christened their son "Cornelius Cadmus Crennel." By 1768, Cornelis and his family were members at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's Anglican</a> church. He was a vestryman there as well. At that time, he joined in a petition to get the parsonage lot behind the church and his family included two people. His name appeared on a church <a href="../../coerec1771.html">roster</a> at the end of 1771.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property was accorded a modest assessment. He also was a private in Barent Bradt's <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company from the first ward.

<p>In September 1763, he submitted an account and was ordered to be <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA145&lpg=PA151&dq#PPA145,M1">paid</a> for painting the Albany fire engine. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1768">1768</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the third ward.

<p>Approaching or past his fiftieth birthday at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, Cadmus was more likely to serve on the homefront. In November 1776, the Albany committee <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;rgn=full%20text;idno=ABP1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000625">ordered</a> him to distribute 340 bushels of salt to the districts according to their ration. He would be paid four pence per bushel for his trouble.

<p>In August 1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#7506">identified</a> as the barracks master at Saratoga under the auspices of the Quartermaster General.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7506">1788</a>, his personal property was assessed under the first ward home of Widow Martin.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> does not seem to have been included on the census of heads of household anywhere in New York State unless he was the "Cornelius Kagle" <a href="../../census1790.html#db">listed</a> at the end of Albany's second ward.

<p>Perhaps he was the Cornelius Cadmus whose name appeared along with that of his wife on a city <a href="../../poor.html#7506">poor list</a> in 1799.

<p>At this point, we are <a href="../qqqq.html">uncertain</a> about how or if the information presented here fits together. Thus, we will step back from this profile at this time.</P>
