          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Sara Cuyler</B></A> was born in 1693, the daughter 
            of Albany trader Johannes Cuyler and Elsie Ten Broeck - the daughter 
            of <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a>. This Albany 
            native grew up a member of a large family living on Pearl Street.</P>

          <p>As her family's fifth daughter, she waited until she was almost thirty to marry 
            twenty-eight-year-old <a href="../h/hanshansen4954.html">Johannes 
            "Hans" Hansen</a> in 1723. He was an Albany merchant, trader, and 
            landholder. The first of their eight children was born later that 
            year.</p>

<P>Their marriage lasted thirty-three years. Sara presided over the family  home while her husband devoted more time to civic matters - culminating in his appointment as mayor of Albany in 1731 and again in 1754. She was a pewholder in the Albany Dutch Church.</P>

<p>Hans Hansen died in the spring of 1756. His will made Sara sole heir and co-executor of his estate. She lived on in her <a href="../../census1756.html#140">"good house"</a> on Pearl Street with her sons for more than a decade.</p>
