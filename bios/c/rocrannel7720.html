      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Robert Crannel</strong></a> was born in 
        July 1726. He was the first child born to the marriage of <a href="wmcrannel7721.html">William</a> 
        and <a href="../b/mgtben7315.html">Margarita Bennewe</a> Crannel. He grew 
        up in a modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
      <p>In November 1748, he married <a href="../b/arbove.html">Ariaantie Bovie</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1760, six 
        children had been christened at Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
        He was a member and officer at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> 
        Anglican church. He also was a regular baptism sponsor at and supporter 
        of the Dutch church. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#273">1756</a> he was identified as 
        a "wigmaker" on a census of householders taken by the British army. 
      <p>During the 1760s, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> house 
        and lot were accorded modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>. 
      <p>In 1765, he was described as a barber and as a potential juror in an 
        Albany <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html">court case</a>. In 1769, he was 
        named co-executor of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cUEGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=%22robert+crannel%22&source=web&ots=vT2614CfuW&sig=YcxN3f8CyNFnSkoaltr_yrmev8I">will</a> 
        of his brother-in-law - a New York City-based surgeon. 
      <p>In 1793, "Robert Cranny" (or his heirs) owed a small sum to the <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#7720">estate</a> 
        of the late William Charles. 
      <p>After that, his name seems to have dropped from the <a href="../../cbr.html">community 
        record</a>. He does not appear to appear on either of the first two <a href="../../census1790.html">censuses</a> 
        of heads of households in New York State. However, in June 1802, Dutch 
        church burials recorded the interrment of "Robert Crannel's wife" (not 
        widow). Perhaps, he lived (or more likely had lived) in the households 
        of his offspring. </p>
