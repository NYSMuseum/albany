<P>Englishman <A  href="#biography"><B>Richard Cartwright</B></A> was early Albany's most notable innkeeper.</p>

          <p>Born in London, England about 1720, as a young man he emigrated to America. 
            He first appeared as a frontier trader with Albany as a base of operations. 
            By 1743, he had married Albany native <a href="../b/anbeasley6509.html">Hannah 
            Beasley</a> - the daughter of an English soldier turned schoolteacher. 
            Most of their eight children were baptized in <a href="../../../../stpeters.html">St. 
            Peters</a> Anglican Church where both parents were prominent members. 
            At the same time, the couple were frequent sponsors at the Albany 
            <a href="../../../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>.</p>

          <p>More and more from his Albany home, Cartwright peddled sundries to settlers 
            and shipped out their farm and forest products. He also made wines 
   and benefitted from dealings with the Albany <a href="../../../../corporation.html">corporation</a> 
            and <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a> - a long-term 
            patron. Within two decades, the one-time drifter had become a <a href="#successful">successful</a> 
            and well-connected Albany businessman.</p>

<p>But by the 1760s, Cartwright had opened a tavern on Albany's Southside. It soon became a focal point for English speaking people in the region. The tavern quickly became an inn - widely known as "The King's Arms." It offered boarding and stabling for those in Albany on business or passing through to the post-war frontier. <a href="#postal">Postal service</a>, land and lottery sales, and a range of other business were conducted across Cartwright's tables. Albany's first <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic Lodge</a> also met there where Richard Cartwright was the lodge master.</p>

<p> Prominence apparently bred misplaced trust as, by 1770, Cartwright's unfulfilled investments left him "ruined" and facing the prospect of debtors prison. He <a href="#wrote">wrote</a> to Sir William Johnson that "neither extravagance or neglect have brot. this load of misfortune on me." He offered his comfortable new home for sale to satisfy his most "merciless"  Manhattan-based creditor. Coupled with personal illness, by the eve of the Revolution Richard Cartwright had suffered a serious reversal of fortune. As storm clouds gathered, he contemplated leaving Albany althogether.</p>

          <p>Although the first public meeting of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
            of Correspondence</a> was held at "The King's Arms," everyone knew 
            that Richard Cartwright considered himself an Englishman and a supporter 
            of the crown. As his tavern became more and more the resort of pro-British 
            personages, he came under scrutiny particularly following an <a href="../../or/or-be.html">incident 
            in June 1776</a>. By the following May, he had been identified as 
            "suspicious," brought before the committee, and upon refusing to sign 
            a loyalty oath, was threatened with removal to the "<a href="#fleet">Fleet 
            Prison</a>." Although he later relented, his personal sympathies and 
            the emergence of Richard Cartwright, Jr. as an overt Tory, caused 
            him to be banished from Albany after refusing another oath in July 
            1778.</p>

<p>After having been been beaten and bruised and seeing his tavern and home vandalized by the revolutionaries, Cartwright packed four wagons of belongings and, with his family, made his way to Canada. Granted a military pension until the end of the war, Richard Cartwright became a magistrate in Ontario. He later testified that he stayed in Albany until 1778 "for the sole purpose of assisting friends of government and furnishing information to the king's officers."</p>

<p>Despite petitioning for compensation as an American Loyalist, Cartwright never recovered financially and later stated that he and his wife were destitute and living on Governor Haldimand's charity. Richard Cartwright died at Kingston, Ontario in October 1794 in his seventy-third year.</p>
