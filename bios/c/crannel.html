<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the<a href="#sources"> <strong>Crannel</strong></a> family of early Albany was borne out of the marriage of Englishman <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/crannell.html">Robert Crannel</a> and his wife, Massachusetts native Molly/Mary Winslow (daughter of Plymouth governor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josiah_Winslow">Josiah Winslow</a>). They are said to have married in New York in 1693. Because we have not uncovered <a href="../../res/ts.html">actual</a> evidence of an Albany life for these pioneers, we have not pursued them beyond the sources noted on this page.

<p>Beginning with one of their sons, <a href="wmcrannel7721.html">William Winslow Crannel</a>, the family maintained a modest but consistent presence <a href="../../earlycity.html">in</a> the city throughout the eighteenth century. Many <a href="../../res/sp.html">variants</a> of the family name have been found. We have adopted "Crannel" as the most often encountered spelling in the community-based record. At this point, we do not know that the names "Crandall" or "Crennel" belong with the Crannels of early Albany.

<p>A census of city households made by the British in 1756 identified the home of wigmaker <a href="rocrannel7720.html">Robt. Crannel</a>. A <a href="wmcrannel7737.html">son</a> was a barber as well.

<p>By the second half of the century, the family had spread out across the colony of New York. At this point, we are uncertain of any connection with the downriver Crannels.

<p>During the era of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Am</a>erican Revolution, these Crannels <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7737">served</a> the  cause in a number of capacities.
 
<p>In 1790, the household of <a href="wmcrannel7737.html">William Winslow Crannel</a> was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet. </p>

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22crannel&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22crannel&f=false">1813</a>, two Crannels were listed in the first city directory.</p>

<p>From the children of the first Robert Crannel, the family spread up and across New York. After the Revolution, the Crannels spread across the country. Albany native <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/crannell.html#202">William Winslow Crannell</a> (1835-1908), the fifth member of the family so named, practiced law in Albany and was a historical collector as well.</p>
