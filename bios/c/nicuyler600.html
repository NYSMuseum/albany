<P><a href="#sources"><b>Nicholas Cuyler</b></a> was born in June 1716. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="abcuyler358.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../b/cableecker153.html">Catharina Bleecker</a> Cuyler. His mother was in her mid-forties at the time of his birth.</p>

<p>Nicholas followed his father and older brother into the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> - representing his family at outposts beyond Albany, before settling down as a member of the Albany <a href="../../econ/comec.html">business community</a>.</p>

<p>In May 1745 he was a decade older than most Albany grooms when he married a much younger <a href="../s/maschuyler1535.html">Maria Schuyler</a>. By 1748, the marriage had produced three children who were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, pewholder, and elder. However, the marriage was short-lived as Maria died in early 1750 at the age of twenty-four.</p>

<p>These Cuylers were living in the State Street home he <a href="../../wills/willabcuyler358.html">inherited</a> along with external real estate from his father. He was identified as a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#600">merchant</a> on a number of survey documents. Although his holdings were quite valuable, he did not hold community leadership positions. Instead, he served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#600">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.</p>

<p>In 1770, a large stock of his flour was included in a <a href="../../doc/olivebranch1770.html">cargo</a> that an Albany ship carried to the West Indies. After the early 1770s, his name dropped from Albany rolls. Nicholas Cuyler was dead by 1799 when his "heirs" were listed on an Albany assessment list.</p>
