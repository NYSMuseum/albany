<P>Based on subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#7658">sources</a>, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Augustus Claudius</strong></a> was born between 1756 and 1774. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Many <a href="../../res/sp.html">variations</a> in the representation and spelling of his name have been encountered in the community-based record. Currently, we reference this Albany resident as "Augustus Claudius" - although no local resources have spelled the name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius">exactly</a> that way.  

<p>Our subject was living in Albany in <a href="../../census1800.html#7658">1800</a>, when his (Cladus) household in the first ward included a couple between 26 and 45 and one young girl. However, we have not yet been able to locate his household on the city census for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>.

      <p>We believe that he was the husband of "Widow Mary" and that they had at least 
        one child born during the 1790s. However, no records for the family have 
        been encountered in the available records of the early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
      <p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, his small house and lot on Orange Street in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> were accorded modest assessments.

<p>The <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22cludius+augustus%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22cludius%20augustus%22&f=false">first</a> and second city directories (1813 and 1814) identified him (Cludius) as a "segarmaker" at 32 Orange Street. However, by 1815, the directory instead listed widow Mary at 32 Orange. Widow Mary was last listed in 1817. In 1830, <a href="../qqqq.html#one">an</a> Augustus Cludius was identified as a "tobaconist" in the rear of 51 Liberty Street.

<p>Following the latest sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based resources</a>, and with basic demographic issues still unresolved, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Augustus Claudius.</p>
