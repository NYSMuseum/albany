      <P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Lambert 
        Cole</strong></a> (Cool) was an Albany resident during the middle decades 
        of the eighteenth century. Perhaps he was a son of the Cole family who 
        previously had settled in Ulster County. We seek defining information 
        on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 
      <p>In December 1743, he married <a href="../k/makid5992.html">Marytje Kitnie</a> (Kidney) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1752, four children had been christened at the church where the parents were occasional baptism sponsors.

<p>In December 1746, he was among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DwgKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA631&lpg=PA631&dq=%22lambert+cole%22&source=bl&ots=DPh-40E_co&sig=OOUkCoLxg4HShoHKcjbriQbHKbs&hl=en&ei=PnI5ToPeFsbq0QGftNnMAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22lambert%20cole%22&f=false">paid</a> for "coming express from Albany to New York" on <a href="../../cia.html">CIA</a> business. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#223">1756</a>, his small home was configured on a list compiled by the British army. At that time, he was identified as a "<a href="http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewpage&page_id=B943473C-ECF4-B82F-8FE79F8B67127C47">hoopmaker</a>".

<p>In April 1762, he was "let the house and lot of ground on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">G</a>allows Hill" from the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=%22lambert+cool%22&source=bl&ots=wxeEaYAbju&sig=s8xjehWFK-WgShop_XLfjiAMrv4&hl=en&ei=AXU5ToSsEcje0QG4rZSfBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22lambert%20cool%22&f=false">city</a> for three pounds a year.

<p>During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his first ward holdings were accorded the most modest of assessments.

<p>In 1767, the name of a Lambert Cole was included on a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA853&lpg=RA12-PA853&dq=militia+1767+kool&source=web&ots=hq0KulgrC3&sig=KO3WO4tIB1dP9VDxGJLcFoFoa8s&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false">roster</a> of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 

<p>However, by March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7666">1779</a>, Lambert Cole probably was dead as the property of his widow was valued on the first ward assessment roll. That was the last reference to him retrieved so far from the community-based record.

<p>In 1793, his name was <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#7666">included</a> on a list of those owing the estate of William Charles.

<p>We seek information on the later life and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a> of Albany resident Lambert Cole .</p>
