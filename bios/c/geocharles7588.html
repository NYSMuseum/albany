<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>George Charles</strong></a> was born about 1767. He was the son of immigrant butcher <a href="wmcharles7590.html">William</a> and <a href="../h/mahogan1118.html">Mary Hogan</a> Charles. He grew up a part of a small <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> family. George <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1118">lost</a> his father during the 1780s. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1118">1790</a>, he was accounted for under the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household of his widowed mother. In 1792, George and his mother were granted <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration on William Charles's estate. A few months later, they sponsored an extensive <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html">inventory</a> of the Charles property and obligations.  By that time, George had taken over and had <a href="../../trades/meat.html">diversified</a> the family business.

<p>By 1796, he had married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> <a href="../p/maprice.html">Mary Price</a>. Over the next eighteen years, the marriage had produced at least seven children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>His <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tan</a>nery and lot probably located on the flats of the lower <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>) and personal property were valued on the first ward assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7588">1800</a>, his budding family was configured on the first ward census. Subsequent censuses documented the growth of his family.

<p>Beginning in 1800, he further augmented his South End holdings by purchasing <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lots</a> along Liberty Street. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">1841</a>, an assessment roll noted he still owned at least five properties on the south side of South Pearl Street. 

<p>By <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22charles%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22charles%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was being listed in the city directory as a tanner at 144 Washington (later <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl</a> Street). By 1816, the directory also was listing him as "inspector of leather" at 146 South Pearl Street. His tannery was a South End <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">landmark</a>.

<p>George Charles died at the end of October 1848. He had lived eighty-one years. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in April 1850. </p>
