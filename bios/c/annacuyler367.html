<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Cuyler</strong></a> was born in Albany in November 1685, the first of the twelve children of <a href="jocuyler546.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../t/elstbroeck42.html">Elsie Ten Broeck</a> Cuyler. Her father was a prominent merchant and one-time <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany. Her mother was the daughter of one of the <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html">founders</a> of the city of<A href="#portrait"><IMG align=left alt="Anna Cuyler Van Schaick" border=+2 hspace=4 src="../../images/jpg/anna.jpg" vspace=4 width=200 height=275></A> Albany. She grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of a wealthy businessman and officeholder. She would have been among the six daughters and two sons listed in the <a href="../../wills/willjocuyler546.html">will</a> written by her father in 1736. Her <a href="cocuyler388.html">brother</a> would become mayor of Albany in 1742.</P>

<p>While most early Albany <a href="../../marriages.html">marriages</a> involved brides in their early twenties, in 1712 twenty-seven-year-old Anna married thirty-year-old widower <a href="../vs/anvschaick3936.html">Anthony Van Schaick, Jr.</a> He was a son of a farming-based, early Albany business family.  Over the next fourteen years, Anna gave birth to at least nine of the previously childless Van Schaick's children - the last arriving as she passed her forty-first birthday.</p>

<p>The couple set up housekeeping in Albany's first ward. By the 1720s, they had moved across State Street and were living in a house next to that of her parents on the east side of Pearl Street. A decade later, Anthony Van Schaick, Jr. inherited his father's estate on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Schaick_Island">island</a> in the Hudson ten miles north of Albany. Like many affluent Albany business families of that time, Anna's family enjoyed both city and countryside residences.</p> 

<p>The handsome, pastel <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/womenshistory/anna.html">portrait</a> shown here is said to have been the work of the twice-widowed American artist Henrietta Dering Johnston during the 1720s.</p>
 
      <p>Anna Cuyler Van Schaick died in July 1741 at the age fifty-five and was buried 
        in the Dutch church burial ground. Then in his early sixties, Anthony 
        Van Schaick, Jr. was left to raise their large family until his passing 
        in 1759.</p>
