<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Cuyler, Jr. </strong></a> was born in January 1746. He was the son of <a href="jocuyler580.html">Johannes A.</a> and <a href="../w/cawendell2769.html">Catherine Wendell</a> Cuyler. He was the last child of a large <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> family. However, his mother died a few months following his birth and he had lost both of his parents by the time he was two.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the particulars of his childhood. However, we expect that young Jacob the other children of Johannes and Catherine would be absorbed within the greater <a href="../c/cuyler.html">Cuyler</a> family and their inlaws. This individual became an Albany resident and was known as "Jacob Cuyler, Jr." to avoid confusion with a slightly older and very prominent kinsman who was called <a href="../c/jacuyler539.html">Jacob J. Cuyler</a>.

<p>In his mid-twenties at the outbreak of hostilities, we expect to find some record of wartime service. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#540">land bounty right</a> under the  city military regiment.

<p>Perhaps this individual remained single as no marriage or childbearing information has appeared in the <a href="../../churches.html">records</a> thus far encountered. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#540">1790</a>, his household on the <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">corner</a> of Market and Steuben included four members and two slaves. Two years earlier, the property was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#540">assessed</a> moderately. In <a href="../../census1800.html#540">1800</a>, the slaves had been replaced by free people of color along with two older men and an older woman.

<p>In June 1793, he witnessed a Rensselaer County <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/rensselaer_will1.htm">will</a>.

<p>The third ward assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> valued his lot separately and his personal property under the third ward  house and lot of John Cuyler. 

<p>In October 1823, an Albany newspaper reported that <a href="../../res/guess.html">a</a> Jacob Cuyler died at <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/coxsackie_cemetery.htm">Coxsackie</a> at the age of seventy-seven years. That individual was buried in the Coxsackie cemetery.</p>
