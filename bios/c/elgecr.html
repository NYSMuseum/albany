<P>Spelled and referred to variously, <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer <a href="#sources"> <strong>Eldert Gerbertsz Cruyff</strong></a> lived in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> at least during the early 1660s. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to the community that became Albany in 1664.

<p>The seminal <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">biographical compilation</a> for his lifetime <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=yPpEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA845&lpg=PA845&dq=%22eldert+gerbertsz+cruyf+(cruijff,+kruyf)%22&source=bl&ots=BcHZE6pKY-&sig=qkxWhEBp-GVspdc8wVsgVwJjqiw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=swiYVZT6C8Xv-QH7kI-AAw&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22eldert%20gerbertsz%20cruyf%20(cruijff%2C%20kruyf)%22&f=false">tells us</a> that Eldert Gerbertsz emigrated in 1654 and that he was from "Hilversum,[in Gooiland, province of North Holland]; and also was referred to as "Eldert de Goijer."

<p><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dXUcYTXRJ8sC&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=eldert+cruyff&source=bl&ots=bia0uftrFW&sig=ZzcVDOm-PUwmmz_waBE_dP5bg58&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RUmZVda2CInz-QHe0LuQBA&ved=0CDkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=eldert%20cruyff&f=false">Perhaps</a> this Eldert Gerbertsen was employed at a sawmill possibly [?] on Manhattan in 1654. Also, he is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qo808tARY-EC&pg=PA515&lpg=PA515&dq=venema+eldert+%22de+goyer%22&source=bl&ots=haaoLHCsBx&sig=Exq8OjhQQbaCh8JHkIY4w5Qvp-U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xj-dVe32IYaigwTY0YHQCg&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=venema%20eldert%20%22de%20goyer%22&f=false">said</a> to have applied for a lot in Beverwyck in 1654. 

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Poss</a>ibly as early as 1655, he took over the farm and then sawmill of <a href="../w/piwinne8568.html">Pieter Winne</a> which appears to have been located south of the village in what later became <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. During the 1650s, he also held property "at" Catskill which he acquired in exchange for his [Cruyff] house in Beverwyck. His holdings have become ensconced in <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/brace_no_21.htm">legend</a> and lore. Mostly, they were beyond the Albany context. However, Eldert Gerbertsz does appear to <a href="../../criteria.html">have had</a> a house in Beverwyck and to have been <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GtoTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA302&lpg=PA302&dq=eldert+cruyff&source=bl&ots=S1ZZIqjHqO&sig=ml1IRR3BT3wgWlF9fqkE_GRDSo4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=RUmZVda2CInz-QHe0LuQBA&ved=0CDEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=eldert%20cruyff&f=false">indebted</a> to <a href="../g/hagansevoort4653.html">Harme Gansevoort</a>.

<p>During the late 1660s and beyond, one "Eldert Gerberts" was a regular (even frequent) <a href="http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/files/2114/2777/4963/Court_Minutes_of_Albany_Rennselaerswyck_and_Schenectady_1668-1673_Vol_I.pdf">litigant</a> before the Albany court. Those numerous actions involved a range of activities and subjects.
 
<p>In July 1663, he filed a joint <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#v=onepage&q=cruyff%2C%20eldert%20gerbertsen&f=false">will</a> with his second wife <a href="../j/trynjans.html">Tryntie Jans</a>, the widow of Jan Janse [Ryckman]. The calendar entry is <a href="#will">transformed below</a>.
	   
      <p>In 1675, a deceased Eldert Gerbertsz was referenced in a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA115&lpg=PA115&dq=eldert+cruyff&source=bl&ots=zDiVmVNDjP&sig=DumYwv-O5U2-jwJviDKh0KeQGNI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GVeZVbhfjNj5Ad_8k-AM&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=eldert%20cruyff&f=false">legal 
        document</a> filed by his stepson, <a href="../r/ajryckman1905.html">Albert 
        Janse Ryckman</a>. 
      <p>By <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22eldert+gerbertsz%22">inference</a>, 
        this individual (sometimes referred to as "<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=eldert+%22de+goyer%22">de 
        Goyer</a>") may have been a resident of Beverwyck and possibly of Albany. 
        The name has a New Amsterdam context as well. We seek defining information 
        on his birth <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">and</a> death dates and also 
        about other marriages.</p>
