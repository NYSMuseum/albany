<P><A href="#biography"><B>Jacobus Clement</B></A> was born in Schenectady in 1718. He was the eldest son of the five children born to Joseph and Anna Peek Clement. His father was a Mohawk Valley farmer and frontier trader.</P>

          <P>In 1743, Jacobus married <a href="../vw/janvwoert2606.html">Jannetje 
            Van Woert</a> in the Albany Dutch church. Their marriage produced 
            at least three children between 1747 and 1750. However, only <a href="../c/niclement.html">one 
            son</a> lived past childhood.</P>

          <p>During the 1750s, he was an <a href="#jp">interpreter</a> of some note - serving 
            at a number of conferences with the Iroquois and informing <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir 
            William Johnson</a> of the proceedings and other matters. A British 
            army <a href="../../census1756.html#216">census</a> of Albany householders 
            in 1756 identified him as an "Indian Trader." He also may have served 
            as a ranger during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. 
          </p>

<p>Jacobus Clement died between <a href="#1759">1759</a> and 1766. His widow lived in their Southside home until her death in 1796.</p>

            <A name=biography>The life of <B>Jacobus Clement</B> is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 7648. This profile is derived 
            chiefly from family</a> and community-based resources. See Mary Ellen 
            Van Camp's <a href="http://nova.bsuvc.bsu.edu/~00mevancamp/clement.html">Clement 
            Family Ancestral History</a>. We still have not seen: William M. Clement, 
            "Clement History," copy at the Montgomery County History Center, Fonda; 
            or Merton L. Dillon, "The Clement Family," (1949?).</p>

<p><a name=jp></a>His activities as interpreter are chonicled in volume 9 of the <a href="../../sources.html#jp"><i>Johnson Papers</i></a>.</p>

<p><a name=1759></a>The <b>last recorded reference</b> to his life comes from a baptism he witnnessed with his wife on November 15, 1759. He probably did not die in Albany. His wife was called a widow in 1766.</p>
