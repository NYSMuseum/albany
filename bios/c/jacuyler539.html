      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob J. Cuyler</strong></a> was born in 
        September 1741. He was the son of <a href="jocuyler581.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../g/caglen4919.html">Catharina Glen</a> Cuyler. He was the 
        youngest child in the relatively small family of a prominent second ward 
        businessman. For most of his adult life, he was referred to as simply 
        "Jacob Cuyler" probably because the other same named kin were a generation 
        younger. 
      <p>In March 1764, he married <a href="../vv/lyvvechten2457.html">Lydia Van 
        Vechten</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1780, seven children had been christened in Albany where he was a pewholder 
        and baptism sponsor. 
      <p>These Cuylers lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        and were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#539">mainstays</a> for 
        several decades. During that time, <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#539">ass</a>essment 
        <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#539">ro</a>lls accorded his holdings 
        a value comparable to other successful merchants. He served his community 
        as firemaster, contractor, and was manager of the lottery during the early 
        1770s. 
      <p>In 1767, he was left a share of the <a href="../../wills/willjoglen4933.html">estate</a> 
        of his mother's brother. 
<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#539">1766</a>, he joined his neighbors in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. In 1767, he was the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html">first lieutenant</a> in his cousin's Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 
      <p>In his thirties at the outbreak of hostilities, this active businessman, 
        sloop owner, and cousin of the last royalist mayor of the city might be 
        suspected of wartime profiteering. However, his loyalty to the crusade 
        for American liberties was not to be called into question. He posted bonds 
        and also acted as bailsman for a number of acquaintances. 
      <p><a href="#note"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/notejacobcuyler.jpg" align=right vspace=2 hspace=2 width=300 alt="promissory note for 2 shillings signed by Jacob Cuyler"></a>For 
        the duration of that body's lifetime, Jacob Cuyler was a stalwart member 
        of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> 
        - representing the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and being 
        re-elected year after year. He served in virtually all areas but was particularly 
        identified with procuring and delivering supplies to bolster the American 
        war effort. In <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">1778</a>, he joined a number 
        of middle-aged patriots in signing an Association to serve on active duty 
        in the event of invasion. Earlier, he served as a delegate from Albany 
        to the New York Provincial Congress. He also served in the Continental 
        Commissary General's office. In May 1780, Colonel Jacob Cuyler <a href="../../sources.html#cp">applied</a> 
        to the governor for exemptions from field duty for himself and members 
        of his staff. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#539">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="more to follow!"></a> 
      <p>After the war, his life assumed a lower public profile with the exception 
        of being named supervisor for the second ward in <a href="../../doc/nn1.html#539">1785</a>. 
        In <a href="../../census1790.html#539">1790</a>, his household included 
        six family members and four slaves. A decade later, he seems to have either 
        <a href="../../census1800.html#540">moved</a> to the third ward, moved 
        in with a kinsman, or relocated to the countryside.
