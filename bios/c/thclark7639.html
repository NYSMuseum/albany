<P>Subsequent sources tell us that Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Thomas Clark</strong></a> was born between 1756 and 1774. Perhaps he was a son in the large Albany family of Patrick and Cornelia Waldron <a href="pclark7635.html">Clark</a>. However, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. A number of <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22thomas+clark%22+albany+1800&spf=1498648783240">same-named contemporaries</a> (<a href="https://www.ancestry.com/mediaui-viewer/tree/3454472/person/1233352246/media/4d3d5118-9741-4e3b-b937-011973b14f02">especially</a>) are at risk in the region.

<p>In July <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">1796</a>, <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Thomas Clark was identified as a "fireman" in Division #4. 

<p>The census of Albany for <a href="../../census1800.html#7639">1800</a> configured his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household with only a male and a female aged 26-45 and one slave.  The Clark surname appeared four times on that survey. At this point we <a href="../../res/guess.html">surmise</a> that he was married but no information on a subsequent family has yet been encountered.

<p>In 1815, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> identified <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> Thomas Clark as an innkeeper at 154 South Pearl Street. (Directories from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA96&dq=%22gardner+clark%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=clark&f=false">before</a> and afterwards listed more than a dozen Clark-named addresses but none for Thomas).

<p>Having past the point of diminishing returns and still missing important information on his life, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany resident Thomas Clark</p>
