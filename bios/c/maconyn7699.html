<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Conyn</b></a> was the wife of <a href="../g/hagansevoort4653.html">Harmen Harmanse</a> and the matriarch of the Albany <a href="../g/gansevoort.html">Gansevoort</a> family! She was the daughter of Beverwyck brewer/trader <a href="leconyn3769.html">Leendert Conyn</a> and his wife, Agnietie.</p>

<p>As she lived until 1743, she probably was born about 1650 - making her at least fifteen years younger than her husband. Their <a href="#marriage">marriage</a> during the 1670s may have produced as many as twelve children who further established the Gansevort name in Albany. Like most of her family, Maria probably was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she witnessed a number of baptisms.</p>

<p>Wife and mother, in 1678 she appeared in court to argue a case on behalf of her husband. By that time, these Gansevoorts had become <a href="../../census1679.html#4653">Albany mainstays</a> as Harmen Harmanse successfully followed her father in the brewing business.</p>

<p>Harmen Harmanse died in 1708 "a very old man!" In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7699">1709</a>, Maria's name appeared on the assessment roll as the owner of substantial property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.</p>  

<p>Maria Conyn Gansevoort's long life came to a close in January 1743. She was <a href="../../dead.html">bu</a>ried in the Albany Dutch church cemetery.
