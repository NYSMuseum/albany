<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Crannel</strong></a> appears to have been born in New York about 1702 or 1703. He was the son of English 
        emigre&acute Robert <a href="../../res/sp.html">Crannel</a> and his wife 
        Mary Winslow Crannel. During the early 1700s, his father appears to have 
        been a soldier in one of the <a href="../../garrison.html">Independent 
        Companies</a> on duty in New York and possibly stationed in Albany. His 
        mother was the daughter of a prominent <a href="../../yankinv.html">New</a> England fammily. This individual also has been referred to as "William Winslow Crannell."
		 
<p>In June 1726, he married Albany native <a href="../b/mgtben7315.html">Margarita 
        Bennewe</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their 
        first child was christened the following month. By 1739, three more of 
        their children were baptized in Albany where he was an occasional baptism 
        sponsor. He was the father of at least eight children. 
		
<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1725">1725</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Aside from that, he seems to have made no impact on the extant <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a>. Perhaps he was absorbed under the holdins of his in-laws, the Bennewes.

<p>William Crannel died early in 1757 and was buried in the churchyard on January 7. A number of his descendants became residents of the Upper Hudson region. </p>
