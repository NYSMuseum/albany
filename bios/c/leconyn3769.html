<P>According to <a href=https://www.google.com/#q=leendert+conyn&hl=en&prmd=imvnso&ei=KQBNT9-ZMObH0QHsl5zKAg&start=10&sa=N&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=c839fc7a1a5cc7d7&biw=1440&bih=736"">family</a>-based resources, <a href="#sources">Leendert Phillipse Conyn</a> (Conine) was born at Ghent in the Netherlands (now 
Belgium) in 1620.

<p>We seek definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to the community that became Albany in 1664.

<p>By 1645, he was in New Amsterdam where he married Agnietie Caspers. The marriage produced a number of children. They were the founders of the Conyn/Conine family of colonial New York!</p>

<p>Leendert Philipse was living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> at the initial distribution of <a href="../../lists/list1650s.html">houselots</a> in 1654. He was known in Beverwyck and then in Albany as a tailor, brewer, and <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#3769">fur trader</a>. His home was configured on the Albany censuses of <a href="../../census1679.html#3769">1679</a> and <a href="../../census1697.html#047">1697</a> - when he was living 
        alone with his wife in a riverside home. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3769">1699</a>, 
        he joined with his Albany neighbors in swearing loyalty to the king of 
        England. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> and an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>
      <p>Approaching his eighties, Leendert Phillipse Conyn may have relocated 
        to Manhattan where he died in 1704. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3">1709</a>, 
        the third ward home of his widow appeared on the Albany assessment roll.</p>

<p>His <a href="phconyn7700.html">son</a> became an Albany resident. Within a generation, however, the name no longer was included on Albany city rolls. A number of Conyn-born <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&tbs=rcnt%3A1&q=site%3Awww.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany&aq=f&oq=&aqi=#hl=en&safe=off&sclient=psy-ab&q=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+conyn+&pbx=1&oq=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+conyn+&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=2&gs_upl=1394l7293l0l7465l15l14l1l0l0l0l173l1363l9.5l15l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=c839fc7a1a5cc7d7&biw=1440&bih=736">women</a> became important parts of Albany households. The descendants of Leendert and Agniteie did spread out in colonial New York and may have been the inspiration for the naming of "Coney Island!"</p>
