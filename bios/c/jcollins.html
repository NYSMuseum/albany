<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Collins</strong></a> may be considered Albany's first professional <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a>. The most engaging <a href="../../res/ts.html">un</a>documented <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k8N4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA296&lpg=PA296&dq=%22john+collins%22+schuyler&source=bl&ots=bfCssFwSsd&sig=q49Y306JIcxDj8HGJ6GuDc2AwUU&hl=en&ei=i8tFTLOBJoO0lQfg_pi2BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20collins%22%20schuyler&f=false">source</a> tells us that he was born in England about 1670 and had received legal training in Europe. 
		
<p>By the early 1700s, he was in New York and serving in the British <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> companies. Within a few years, he was a lieutenant in the Albany-based company commanded by Captain <a href="../h/hholland8489.html">Henry Holland</a>.</p>

<p>The first record of his Albany life is from notes in his own legal dictionary providing the date of his marriage to the widow <a href="../s/mgtschuyler1455.html">Margarita 
        Schuyler Verplanck</a> on November 2. 1701. Settling in Albany in the 
        "<a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>" soldier enclave, their 
        Albany home grew with the birth of three <a href="#child">Collins children</a> 
        between 1704 and 1714. These children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        Church</a> and he frequently sponsored baptisms there with his wife - 
        a lifelong member. Of British origin, he also was a prominent subscriber 
        for the founding of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> Anglican 
        Church in 1714. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7677">1709</a>, his first ward property was accorded a substantial assessment.</p>
		
<p>His <a href="../../marriages.html">marriage</a> to Margarita Schuyler represented an often-repeated way for aspiring <a href="../../nnd.html">New 
        Netherland</a> families to connect with the English-then British royal 
        establishment. At the same time, marriage to an Albany native qualified 
        Collins to engage in <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a>. However, 
        he became more widely known as an attorney - as his name was most frequently 
        found representing local people and important outsiders at Albany courts 
        and beyond. Although his military career would continue for the remainder 
        of his life, John Collins became a successful Albany businessman by combining 
        a legal practice with supplying the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> 
        and other military initiatives, some importing, and surveying.</p>
		
		
<p>Often on duty at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, Collins was able to form business and legal relationships that extended out into the Mohawk Valley. Although he held no local offices, he was named to the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. As a royal insider, he also obtained shares in frontier <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> patents - 
        owning land north of the Mohawk two miles above <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort 
        Hunter</a>.</p>
		
<p>John Collins died at Schenectady in April 1728. His widow died in 1748. He was succeeded in his enterprises by his son <a href="ecollins.html">Edward</a>.</P>
