<strong>Johannes A. Cuyler</strong></a> was born in June 1698. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="abcuyler358.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../b/cableecker153.html">Catharina Bleecker</a> Cuyler. He grew up in a prominent fur trader's home located on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Steet</a>. He was known as "John A. Cuyler" to distinguish him from his prominent <a href="jocuyler546.html">uncle</a> and <a href="jocuyler581.html">cousin</a>.

      <p>In October 1727, he married <a href="../w/cawendell2769.html">Catharina 
        Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1746, nine children had been christened in Albany where he was a member, 
        pewholder, and baptism sponsor. 
      <p>In 1729, he owned property on the east corner of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market</a> and Steuben Streets. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1732">1732</a>, he was named firemaster for the third ward.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#580">1742</a>, he was identified as a freeholder living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In that year, he was left a share of the <a href="../../wills/willabcuyler358.html">estate</a> of his father which included monies and lands located beyond Albany.

<p>Johannes A. Cuyler lost his wife in April 1746 - following the birth of their last child. Johannes himself died only six months later, in October 1746, and was buried in the Albany churchyard. He had lived but forty-eight years.</p>
