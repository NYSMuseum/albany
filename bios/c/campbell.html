<P>A number of individuals with the surname <a href="#sources"> <strong>Campbell</strong></a> lived <a href="../../criteria.html">in</a> and <a href="../../na/na.html">ar</a>ound Albany during the second half of the eighteenth century. They mostly would be of <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish origins but for the number and spread (e.g. Kemmel) of <a href="../../res/sp.html">variants</a> of the spelling encountered in the community-based and regional record.

<p>Perhaps the first Campbell in Albany appears to have been one <a href="arcampbell7528.html">Archibald Campbell</a> who was included on a city assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and who may have died in 1793. His <a href="../../wills/willarcampbell.html">will</a> of that year named a wife and identified six sons and four daughters. It also noted his Albany property.

<p>Additional same-named contemporaries inhabited greater Albany County during that time.

<P>The personal property of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22daniel+campbell%22+schenectady&start=10">leader</a> "Coll <a href="dacampbell1157.html">Daniel Cambell</a>" was valued substantially on the Albany assessment rolls in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#daca">1779</a>. At that time, he was lodging at either Hugh Denniston's or with Archibald Campbell on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">southside</a> of Albany.
 
<p>At this point, we are treating each individual separately while trying to document kinship connections.

<p>Perhaps the story of newcomer feltmaker <a href="jacampbell7532.html">James Campbell</a> represents different origins.

<p>The most challenging definition problems concern the various "John Campbells" of which at least six lived in Albany during that time.

<p><a href="../../census1790.html#7528">Two</a> Campbell-named households were profiled on the <a href="../../census1790.html#7536">1790</a> city census. In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, four Campbells were enumerated on the census for the city of Albany and its <a href="../../albanycounty.html">environs</a>.

<p>The individual we are now treating as <a href="jocampbell7536.html">John Campbell</a> (the elder), lived in Albany and was dead by January 1802 when letters of administration were issued to his wife.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=P5A9&dq=%22campbell%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22campbell%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed the addresses of seven Campbell-named households.

      <p>Until we can achieve more clarity regarding kinship relations, we continue 
        to collect and synthesize what we know about the Albany Campbells. </p>
