<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Ann Caldwell</strong></a> was born in 1782. She was a daughter in the very large family of Albany newcomers <a href="jacaldwell7509.html">James</a> and <a href="../b/elbarnes.html">Elizabeth Barnes</a> Caldwell. She also was referred to as "Anna Marie." Her father was a successful businessman and entrepreneur who maintained homes in Albany and beyond. Thus, he was able to match his Ann and his other children with exceptional mates.

<p>By 1813, Anna Marie had married the Scottish born and educated physician <a href="../l/jalow.html">James Low</a>. The marriage produced but one <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=664EAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=%22james+low%22+caldwell&source=bl&ots=jGGBz4l4d1&sig=KYvGRui1HlRo19fFew33TYUBfpM&hl=en&ei=orvfTbH9Oanz0gHluqGmBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22james%20low%22%20caldwell&f=false">son</a>.

<p>James Low was a promninent well-connected member of the budding Albany medical community. The couple made their <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22low+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22low%20james%22&f=false">home</a> in the heart of Albany on State Street and then on North Pearl.

<p>In May 1813, "Ann Low" was <a href="../../res/realestate.html">deeded</a> one or more parcels along <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a> by James and Elizabeth Caldwell.

<p>Ann Caldwell Low died in Albany in 1820 at the age of thirty six. She was <a href="http://www.yankeecemetery.com/caldwell_cemetery.htm">buried</a> in the family plot at "Caldwell," today's Lake George. Her husband passed just two years later.</p>
