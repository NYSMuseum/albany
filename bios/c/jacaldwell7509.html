<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">t</a>raditional sources, <a href="#sources"><b>James Caldwell</b></a> was born in Northern Ireland in 1747. He probably was of Scots<a href="../irish.html">-</a>Irish ancestry.</P>

<p>As a young man, he emigrated to America. After spending some time in Philadelphia, he migrated to Albany. In 1772, the grocery store of <a href="jocaldwell7510.html">Joseph</a> and James Caldwell was advertized in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. In that year, he also first signed in at the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic Lodge</a>.
 
      <p>In May 1774, he married fellow emigre <a href="../b/elbarnes.html">Elizabeth Barnes</a> - probabaly in Philadelphia. 
        By the mid-1790s, the marriage had produced at least twelve children. 
        Like most immigrant Scots, he was a member and officer of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian 
        church</a>.</p>
      <p>From a rented room in the home of <a href="../v/jovisscher4145.html">John 
        Visscher</a>, Caldwell's business expanded to a substantial building along 
        <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a>. Eventually, his store 
        and storage would extend to the bank of the Hudson. He owned other property 
        in Albany and Watervliet as well.</p>
      <p>As a British-identified, relative newcomer, Caldwell figured to be watched 
        closely by his new Albany neighbors as colonists became <a href="../../or/or.html">revolutionaries</a> 
        during the mid-1770s. From the outset, he supported Albany relief initiatives, 
        sold store items to the Albany committee, and took part in community-based 
        activities short of actual involvement or problems with the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a>. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=15 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a>&nbsp; 
        His stock figured as personal property received high assessment on county-wide 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">tax lists</a> for 1779. By that 
        time, he had made the transition from grocer to "merchant."</p>
		
<p>After the war, his business took on many new dimensions and involved 
        a number of partners.&nbsp; <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=6 alt="in-progress; much more on his Albany life can be added here!"></a>

<p>A notable <a href="../../doc/1788afc.html">Federalist</a>, in August 1788, he was beaned by a brick during a <a href="../../doc/albanychronicles.html#08081788">disturbance</a> surrounding celebration of the ratification of the Federal Constitution.

<p>Caldwell's business base location was in an Albany house at what became 47 <a href="../../loc/statestreet.html">State Street</a>. His Market Street household was 
        configured on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#7509">1790</a>. A decade later, his household was described on the <a href="../../census1800.html#7509">census</a> for the second ward. However, he also owned a number of properties on Market and Pearl Streets and on the streets behind those main arteries as well.
<p>External properties: &nbsp; <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=6 alt="more to come including an engraving of his mills"></a> &nbsp; including the manufacturing complex located in the gorge to the north of Albany near the Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> known as Caldwell's Mills which <a href="">burned</A> in 1794.
<p>He was the founder and initial developer of the settlement first called "Caldwell" at the southern tip of Lake George.	  
	  </p>
      <p>James Caldwell filed a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> in 1825. <a href="#will">It</a> divided his estate into twelve 
        equal parts, and named his wife, two living children, and the children 
        of two deceased children as his heirs. Elizabeth Barnes Caldwell died 
        in September 1827. James Caldwell died in Albany in 1829 and was buried 
        in a <A HREF="http://www.yankeecemetery.com/caldwell_cemetery.htm">cemetery</a> in what is now "Lake George Village."</p>
