      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Margarita Cooper</strong></a> was born in 
        November 1788. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="obcooper498.html">Obadiah</a> 
        and <a href="../vd/anvdb5727.html">Anna Vandenbergh</a> Cooper. She was 
        among seven daughters who grew up in <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">Pearl 
        Street</a> home of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside 
        business family. 
      <p>She was the wife of her first ward neighbor <a href="../w/edwillett2905.html">Edward 
        Willett</a>. Their two surviving children were born well after 1800. 
      <p>Edward Willett followed the <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a> but 
        did not live long enough to prosper. 
      <p>Her husband's <a href="../../wills/willedwillett2905.html">will</a> filed 
        in May 1815 named her as heir and executor. Not yet thirty, Edward Willett 
        died later that year. In 1816, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city 
        directory</a> fixed her address at 22 Union Street. In the years that followed, widow Margaret was listed at a number of first ward addresses.
		
      <p>Margarita Cooper Willett died in July 1846. She was buried 
        in the Dutch church cemetery. She had lived fifty-eight years. </p>
