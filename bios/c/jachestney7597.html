<P>Spelled and referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"><b>James Chestney</b></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Mc Chesney) was a chairmaker and businessman who lived in Albany during the 1780s and afterward. He was born in 1751 or 1752. Perhaps he was the son of <a href="alchesnut7605.html">Al</a>exander and Jane Mc Molly Chesney.</p>

<p>By the 1780s, he had married <a href="../d/codunbar2252.html">Cornelia Dunbar</a>. Their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian 
        church</a> where he was a member and onetime deacon.</p>

<p>James Chestney first lived in Albany's third ward. His middling household along North <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> was listed on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#7597">1790</a>. By <a href="../../census1800.html#7597">1800</a>, he had relocated across town to a home on the <a href="../../loc/edownstate.html">State 
        Street hill</a>. <img src="../../images/jpg/ad1816chestney.jpg" align=left vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="detail from the city directory for 1816" width=300 height=130> 
        By 1813, he was identified as a merchant and chairmaker at 134 State Street. 
        His enterprise there later known as the Albany Chair Factory became an 
        Albany landmark. During that time, he was a prominent member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany 
        Mechanics Society</a>. In 1822, he moved the business down the hill to 
        96 State Steet. Chestney acquired additional properties in the more newly 
        developed parts of the first ward.</p>
		
<p>James Chestney lost his wife in 1826. By that time, he was in his seventies and soon moved west on Washington Avenue. He died in June 1847 at the age of ninety-six and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the recently opened Albany Rural Cemetery. His will passed probate in 1863. </p>

        <a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of James Chestney/Chesney/Mc 
        Chestney is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 7597. This 
        profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We seek more 
        definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. An excellent compilation of genealogical 
        information by Charles Mudd is available <a href="http://www.mudd.org/gen/pages/gedtohtml/wc01/wc01_120.htm">online</a>! 
        We doubt that this individual is the James W. Chestney who made and repaired 
        chairs in Saratoga after 1825 - but perhaps a kinsman.</font></p>
