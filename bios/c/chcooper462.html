<P>Albany physician <a href="#sources"><strong>Charles De Kay Cooper</strong></a> was born in 1769. He was <a href="#nea">said</a> to have been the fourth of the ten sons of Rhinebeck physician Dr. Ananias <a href="#father">Cooper</a> and his wife, Elizabeth De Kay Cooper. This Cooper <a href="cooper.html">family</a> was of English/<a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> ancestry and perhaps migrated to Long Island and then to Dutchess County by the 1750s.

<p>Charles is said to have been sent to New York City to study medicine under <a href="#crosby">one</a> "Dr. Crosby."

<p>Perhaps he was in Albany as early as 1788, when a "Dr. Cooper's" personal property was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#462">valued</a> on a first ward assessment roll under the house of the widow of the recently deceased Dr. <a href="../vd/hvdyck832.html">Henry Van Dyck</a>. By 1791, 
        Cooper had settled in Albany where he was confirmed in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Episcopal Church. In 1792 he began to practice medicine. He 
        married young <a href="../v/mgtvernor2093.html">Margaret Vernor</a>, the 
        adopted daughter of future New York State Lieutenant Governor <a href="../t/jotayler.html">John 
        Tayler</a>. The marriage produced a number of children - two of whom became 
        prominent Albany residents. His daughter married the son of <a href="../n/elnott.html">Eliphalet Nott</a>. A number of same-named descendants are historically visible. 
      <p>These Coopers <a href="../../sources.html#ad">lived</a> in the home of 
        his famous father-in-law at 50 State Street until Tayler's death in 1829. 
        They then moved to 66 <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">North Pearl Street</a>. 
      <p>In January 1793, he was one of those who made an <a href="../../wills/willrhenry8426.html">inventory</a> 
        of the estate of Robert Henry, Jr. 
      <p>In 1794, he was appointed "health officer" of the Albany port by Governor 
        George Clinton. 
      <p>Probably following Tayler, he served as Indian agent and was involved 
        in numerous <a href="../../res/realestate.html#ar">real estate</a> transactions 
        - some of them regarding Revolutionary War land grants.
		
      <p>Publication of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr-Hamilton_duel#Charles_Cooper.27s_Letter">letter</a> 
        Cooper wrote in the <i>Albany Register</i> in April 1804 has been credited 
        with provoking the duel that resulted in the death of Alexander Hamilton. 
      <p>By that time, he had turned from medicine to politics. He served as a judge of the county court, clerk, and in 1817, was appointed Secretary of State. He later was elected to the city council. Over several decades, he was an officer of an number of Albany-based, civic organizations.

<p>Charles De Kay Cooper died in January 1831 and was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#v=onepage&q=charles+d+cooper&f=false">buried</a> in the Dutch church cemetery. He was "<a href="#nea">noted</a> as a man of remarkable physical force, great influence and high sense of honor." He had lived sixty one years. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in 1834.</p>

It read 
          "Cooper, Ananias. The doctors Cooper were all descendants of John Cooper, 
          of Olney, Buckinghampshire, England, who came to America in the ship 
          Hopewell, in 1635, and settled at Lynn, Mass. We first find Dr. Ananias 
          at Bridge Hampton, L. I., in 1755. In 1757 he lived in the Cooper House, 
          on the west side of the Post Road, one mile above Rhinebeck. In 1759 
          he charged the county ten shillings for doctoring a soldier, the first 
          charge made by a doctor against the county for professional work done. 
          This soldier must have been in the French and Indian War. He was a member 
          of Assembly, 1779-80. He died April 4th, 1797. He had a son, Dr. Charles 
          De Kay Cooper, of Albany." (page 44)
