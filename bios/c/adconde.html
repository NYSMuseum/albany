<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Adam Conde</strong></a> lived in Albany during the mid 1720s. Probably born during the early 1700s, we seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that the Conde family is of <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/yates/gen-conde.html">French origins</a> and appeared in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> after this individual left Albany. At least <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=b4k-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA446&lpg=PA446&dq=%22adam+conde%22+de+graff&source=bl&ots=NOCwU1AYDq&sig=EgMB5lEGCu13M4yNsWo7mJUvKnI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ICTuU7X6C8a6oQSF4ICABQ&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22adam%20conde%22%20de%20graff&f=false">Two</a> family-based <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=y8I6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=%22adam+conde%22+de+graff&source=bl&ots=oydj6KhpSk&sig=kKlJFIfVKw_aAIxzTgqDlimPnyM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ICTuU7X6C8a6oQSF4ICABQ&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22adam%20conde%22%20de%20graff&f=false">resources</a> tell us that Adam Conde's parents were <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> refugees who died of a fever at sea en route from Holland to North America and that Adam was adopted and raised by the Lansing family of Albany. These sources hold that young Adam arrived in New York in 1704.

<p>If he was living with the family of <a href="../l/joglansing2051.html">Johannes G. Lansing</a>, the boy would have grown up in the first ward home of a mainline middling Albanian whose marriage in 1704 would produce a number of surviving children. However, we have encountered no references in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based record</a> to Conde within any Lansing family.

      <p>He first appears on the community landscape in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1724">1724</a>, 
        when Conde was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> by the Albany city council. In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1725">1725</a>, 
        he was chosen high constable. After that, his name has not been encountered 
        in the community-based resources that form the backbone of our inquiry.
      <p>In November 1736, he <a href="https://archive.org/stream/marriagerecordso00firs#page/n39/mode/2up">married</a> Catherine De Graff of Schenectady at the Dutch church in that village. The union produced at least six <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/cl_da.html">children</a> who spread out in Schenectady and its environs. His name has not been found in the extant records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
