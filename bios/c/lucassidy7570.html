<P>Future Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Luke Cassidy</strong></a> probably was born within a few years of 1750.  We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Later references connect him to <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> and Catholic backgrounds. Inconsistent <a href="../../res/sp.html">spellings</a> of his name complicate filling out this person's life. 

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA800&lpg=RA12-PA800&dq=militia+1767+casady&source=web&ots=hq0KulgrC3&sig=KO3WO4tIB1dP9VDxGJLcFoFoa8s&hl=en#v=snippet&q=casady&f=false">1767</a>, he was one of two drummers listed on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, Luke "Cassady" was named constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. The next <a href="../../org/cc.html#1772">year</a> he was appointed to serve in the third ward. In December <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=%22luke+cashady%22&source=bl&ots=wygEfRtcgu&sig=SpUlk5XkdOOs7vb8ugN5j5fd30U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nvdmVaiZNsLHsQSUyoGwCQ&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22luke%20cashady%22&f=false">1772</a>, his account (probably for service as constable) was paid from the city treasury. Perhaps, he was the "Cashady" appointed constable for the first ward in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA249&lpg=PA249&dq=cashady+albany&source=bl&ots=jx4J-wm7iS&sig=0kE-wWxUxLXYQJgA4UF4vipjyuk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HoNoVZGaCIidygTx7oOIAg&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgo#v=onepage&q=cashady%20albany&f=false">1773</a>. 

<p>On May <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1#page/n37/mode/2up">1775</a>, "Luke Cashady" was paid &pound;3 for "beating the drum to notify the people" by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. The <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a> of this entry bears more thought. 

<p>By the mid-1770s, he had married Albany native <a href="racole7670.html">Rachel Cole</a>. Their son "Ralf" was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in January 1778. After that, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> of Luke Cassidy has not been encountered during our sweeps of community-based sources or in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 

      <p>Perhaps this individual left Albany during the mid-1770s Later, a Luke Casity," 
        a "Luke Cassady" and other "Cassadys" were <a href="http://www.sandycline.com/history/rangers.html">listed</a> 
        on <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~onniagar/history/butlersrangers.htm">ros</a>ters 
        of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler's_Rangers">Butler's Rangers</a> 
        (loyalist regiment). 
      <p>At the same time, the name "Luke Casady" <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_3d_reg.htm">appeared</a> as an enlisted man on a roster of the third regiment of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Line">New York Line</a>.  

      <p>We seek defining information on his wartime service and postwar life. He probably 
        no longer was a resident of Albany. 
      <p>In 1790, <a href="../../res/sp.html">no</a> Luke Cassidy was listed as a <a href="../../census1790.html">head of household</a> in New York State.

<p>With unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the life of Luke Cassidy, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
