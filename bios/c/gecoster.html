<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerritje Coster</b></a> was born during the 1660s. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="hecoster5974.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vs/geervschaick4032.html">Geertje Goosens Van Schaick</a> Coster. Her father died during Gerritje's adolescence and her mother re-married.</p>


<p>In November 1688, she married a somewhat older <a href="../r/joroseboom1671.html">Johannes Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1706, nine children had been christened in Albany where both parents were members. Six of them were still <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">living</a> in November 1737. </p>

<p>After some time as a wide-ranging <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a>, Johannes Roseboom settled his family near their kin in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where they became Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#125">mainstays</a>.

<p>In November 1737, she was named along with six children as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> filed by her husband. 

<p>Otherwise, the name of Gerritje Coster Roseboom seems to have dropped from Albany rolls following the baptism of her twins in 1706. Her husband lived at least until 1745.</p>
