      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Abraham Cuyler</b></a> was born about 1663. He 
        was the second son in the large family of Albany newcomers <a href="../c/hecuyler533.html">Hendrick</a> 
        and <a href="../s/anschepmoes8629.html">Anna Schepmoes</a> Cuyler.</p>
      <p>In 1689, he married Albany native <a href="../b/cableecker153.html">Catharina 
        Bleecker</a>. Over the next two decades, most of their eight children 
        were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        where both parents were members, frequent baptism sponsors, and where 
        Abraham was a church officer.</p>
      <p></p>
      After briefly residing in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>, 
      these Cuylers set up their permanent <a href="../../census1697.html#121">home</a> 
      on Pearl Street - near both of their families. That property received a 
      substantial <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#358">valuation</a> in 1709. 
      In time, Abraham expanded his Albany real estate holdings and acquired lands 
      beyond the stockade as well.
      <p></p>
      <p>Abraham Cuyler prospered in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> 
        and was elected to the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> 
        - first, in 1692, as an assistant and then as alderman for the second 
        ward. Active in civic affairs for several decades, he headed committees 
        on finances and real estate. His home was a Pearl Street <a href="#landmark">landmark</a>.</p>
      <p>Abraham Cuyler lost his wife in April 1734. He filed a <a href="../../wills/willabcuyler358.html">will</a> 
        in May 1742. It left extensive real property holdings in Albany , Schenectady, 
        and beyond to his six surviving children. He died in July 1747.</p>
