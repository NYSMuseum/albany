<P><a href="../../census1800.html#paco">Subs</a>equent sources tell us that Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Patrick Coffee</strong></a> (aka <a href="../../res/sp.html">Co</a>ffey) was born between 1756 and 1774. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In August 1784, <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Patrick Coffee <a href="http://nycnuts.angelfire.com/timelines/bookofjordan408.html">married</a> Elizabeth Jordan (daughter of Stephen Jordan and Margaret Bellone) at Trinity Episcopal Church in New York City. Beginning the following year, that couple christened a number of children at the church where they also were baptism sponsors. In <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&db=1790usfedcen&gss=angs-d&new=1&rank=1&gsfn=pall&gsfn_x=NP_NN_NIC&gsln=coffee&gsln_x=NP_NN&msrpn__ftp=New+York%2c+USA&msrpn=35&msrpn_PInfo=5-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c0%7c35%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c0%7c&MSAV=1&uidh=9w2&pcat=35&fh=0&h=262046&recoff=13+14&ml_rpos=1&hovR=1">1790</a>, one "Pall Coffee" was listed on the census for the "out ward" of New York City in a household consisting of three people. Over the following decades, additional New York based information has been encountered. But, <a href="../qqqq.html">do any of those references</a> point to Patrick Coffee of Albany? At that time, the name was not uncommon in New York City.

<p>Although we have not yet connected the last-named individual to an Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>, the more definitive story of Patrick Coffee in Albany resumes in 1800.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#paco">1800</a>, his household was configured on the census of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.  In February 1801, his name (and house & shop) was <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/6771/41761_328301-00258?pid=343469&backurl=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc%3DYHw5%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource%26usePUBJs%3Dtrue%26gss%3Dangs-g%26new%3D1%26rank%3D1%26gsfn%3Dpatrick%26gsfn_x%3D0%26gsln%3Dcoffee%26gsln_x%3D0%26msypn__ftp%3DAlbany,%2520Albany,%2520New%2520York,%2520USA%26msypn%3D10034%26msypn_PInfo%3D8-%257C0%257C1652393%257C0%257C2%257C0%257C35%257C0%257C128%257C10034%257C0%257C0%257C%26msypn_x%3DPS%26msypn__ftp_x%3D1%26MSAV%3D1%26msydy%3D1800%26cp%3D0%26catbucket%3Drstp%26uidh%3D9w2%26pcat%3DROOT_CATEGORY%26h%3D343469%26recoff%3D7%25208%26dbid%3D6771%26indiv%3D1%26ml_rpos%3D1&treeid=&personid=&hintid=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=YHw5&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true#?imageId=41761_328301-00258">included on a list</a> of those whose property in the first ward was in arrears. 

      <p>After that, his name has not been encountered in our base of <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a> nor in our latest sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based 
        resources</a>. 
      <p>However, <a href="../qqqq.html#one">a</a> Patrick Coffee was <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?_phsrc=YHw68&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true&gss=angs-g&new=1&rank=1&gsfn=patrick&gsfn_x=0&gsln=coffee&gsln_x=0&msypn__ftp=New%20York%20City,%20New%20York,%20USA&msypn=1652382&msypn_PInfo=8-%7C0%7C1652393%7C0%7C2%7C0%7C35%7C0%7C0%7C1652382%7C0%7C0%7C&msbdy_x=1&msbdp=10&MSAV=0&msbdy=1775&cp=0&catbucket=rstp&uidh=9w2&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=7592654&dbid=8054&indiv=1&ml_rpos=1">listed</a> as the head of a New York City household in the 17th ward on the Federal census for 1850. That individual was then seventy-six years old and was born in Ireland (in 1774 or 1775).  [ <a href="../qqqq.html">Q</a> ].

<p>With serious gaps in his story, we now <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> from the life of Patrick Coffee - a resident of the city of Albany in 1800.

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Patrick Coffee 
        has no CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> 
        is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Again, have 
        found no strong resources for the Albany Patrick Coffee beyond the years 
        1800 and 1801. Alternative <a href="../../res/sp.html">spellings</a> of 
        his names (including members of the Cole/Kool family(s) who lived in the region) undoubtedly 
        complicate focusing on this particular individual. Finally, based on the Albany-based spellings of his name, we suspect that this individual's roots will be found in <a href="../irish.html">Ireland</a>. </div>
