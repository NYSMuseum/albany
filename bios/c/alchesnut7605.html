<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Alexander Chesnut</strong></a> (perhaps also <a href="../irish.html">Mc</a> Chestney) probably was born prior to 1750. He <a href="../../criteria.html">lived</a> in Albany during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. We seek information on his <a href-"../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his house and property probably on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany were valued minimally on a city assessment roll. 

<p>In September 1771, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willwmmcew.html">will</a> of Albany resident William Mc Cew.

<p>In May 1775, he was among those in the third ward who pledged 8 shillings to supply Ticonderoga. He also was allowed two pounds for powder horns. Otherwise, his name was not found on the rolls of Albany's wartime <a href="../../coc.html">comm</a>ittees. In <a href="http://www.fort-plank.com/Additional_Partisans_A_G.html">1779</a>, his name was included on a list of those serving in the Mohawk Valley with the Albany city militia. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7605">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>He appears to have been a city resident throughout the war years as his <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7605">shop</a> in the second ward (probably on <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Col</a>umbia Street) was valued on both assessment rolls in 1779. At the same time, his personal property was <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#alch">valued</a> substantially under the third ward house of Widow Edgar. A decade later, his personal holdings were 
<a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7605">assessed</a> under Nanning Visscher while his real <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#chesnut">property</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>, noted as "Chesnut's Shop & School Room," was valued separately.

<p>His wife may have been one "Jane Mc Molly." Their daughter was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in April 1776. However, perhaps, she was their fourth child.

<p>Beginning in 1789, he was identified as a trustee at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7605">1790</a>, his household of three men and three women was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet. We seek to locate him on the census for <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>. However, in 1799 and in 1802, his "shop and lot in Columbia Street" were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">valued</a> on the second ward assessment roll. 

<p>After that, the name of Alexander Chesnut appears to have dropped from Albany rolls. His name has been <a href="http://www.mudd.org/gen/pages/gedtohtml/ps01/ps01_294.htm">followed</a> in family-based resources and <a href="http://herkimer.nygenweb.net/cemeteries/colrefcem.html">perhaps</a> he was still alive when his eighty-seven-year-old wife was buried in Herkimer County in 1814. </p>
