<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Mary Cadogan</strong></a> was the wife of Albany 
        resident <a href="../b/wmbrown7461.html">William Brown</a>. Perhaps she 
        was the "Mary Cadoogan" who was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Anglican church in June 1754 to <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> 
        Hugh Cadoogan and Mary/Catherine Miller. In any event, we seek defining 
        information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p><a href="cacadog.html#cadogan">Perhaps</a> she was the sister of contemporary Albany wives <a href="cacadog.html">Catherine Ruby</a> and <a href="nacadogen.html">Nancy Hilton</a>.

<p>In August 1776, "Polly" Cadogan married <a href="../b/brown.html">Brown</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as single people of Albany County. However, at the <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part6.html">christening</a> of their daughter in March 1779, the parents were entered as "William Brown and Mary Cadogan." Additional children were christened to Brown but with no mother specified.

<p>One of a number of same-named contemporaries, Mary's husband William <a href="../b/brown.html">Brown</a> was an officer in the Revolutionary army and later a merchant and mariner. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7461">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for the second ward. Living there were a boy, two males over 16, and four females of unspecified ages. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7461">1800</a>, the Brown household was enumerated on the city census but no adult woman was shown. Also, no specific mention of Mary/Polly appeared. She may have died much earlier and William Brown may have remarried.
		
<p>In any event, Mary Cadogan Brown was no longer living by 1800 when no adult women were counted on the census of William Brown's household. We seek definitive information on her <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>. Her husband, William Brown, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22capt+william+brown%22+albany&source=bl&ots=cOqU_Ih8NO&sig=gHUYM7iBMG6nuSaOugoPbbJ_Cfc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0meue1frMAhWGPT4KHUl7Dj0Q6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&q=%22capt%20william%20brown%22%20albany&f=false">died</a> in 1825.</p>
