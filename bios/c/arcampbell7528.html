      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Archibald Campbell</b></a> was born about 1736. Several same-named individuals were at risk during the second half of the eighteenth century.   <a href="http://www.electricscotland.com/hiStory/highlands/chapter7.htm">Perhaps</a> this individual worked as a surveyor in New Jersey prior to settling in Albany.

<p>By 1766, he was paying <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">taxes</a> on an Albany house. In 1768, he married <a href="../s/chstarenberg.html">Christina Starenberg</a> of the Schoharie Valley. The marriage produced <a href="../../wills/willarcampbell.html">many</a> children including Archibald who was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1778 and became a prominent Albany resident. Perhaps Albany mainstay <a href="jocampbell7536.html">John Campbell</a> was his son as well.</p>
		
<p>In 1763, he is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TP0cAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22archibald+campbell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=wE7aPzOeKH&sig=Y5bmzklFbA7bcjkMwpFwRHLC7mY&hl=en&ei=rpyFS9arDpT08QaF9ciiAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CA0Q6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=%22archibald%20campbell%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have been deeded a tract of family land in Albany County. He was known regionally as a surveyor. In 1772, he <a href="https://www.adirondackalmanack.com/2013/02/lost-brook-dispatches-campbells-corner.html">laid out</a> a 1.15 million acre tract in the Adirondacks. He also made a number of maps of the city of Albany.</p>

      <p>At the outbreak of the War for Independence, Campbell supported the Revolutionary cause and was <a href="http://www.stanklos.net/?act=para&psname=&pid=3090">named</a> to represent recently formed Charlotte County in the  Provincial Congress. He also <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5vm7k0yfMesC&pg=PA626&lpg=PA626&dq=%22archibald+campbell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=uIHacjAh3B&sig=hNbLNiawb1ildwjju3FuhLeooNY&hl=en&ei=F5-FS__BGIrp8QbNjcWgAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CBcQ6AEwCDgy#v=onepage&q=%22archibald%20campbell%22%20albany&f=false">posted bail</a> for some country people including his father-in-law.</p>
		
      <p>For several decades these Campbells were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#7528">mainstays</a>. 
        During the 1780s, his store "opposite Mr. Denniston's tavern" was advertised 
        in the Albany <a href="../../doc/nn1.html#1784">newspaper</a>. He sold imported tea, sugar, and window glass. 
        He owned and leased a number of lots within the city limits. In 1787, 
        he served as an inspector in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
        He also was a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian 
        church</a>.</p>

<p>After the war, he resumed surveying. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=efoaAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA171&lpg=PA171&dq=%22archibald+campbell%22+sacandaga&source=bl&ots=eB-DlkjmpB&sig=ncjh1u--iDX5_SuvEl2IcsdLDHo&hl=en&ei=UZuFS6bEHcLb8Qb7oeWnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22archibald%20campbell%22%20sacandaga&f=false">1785</a> he was the deputy State Surveyor. In 1789, he <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~srgp/books/1879c04.htm">patented</a> 3,000 acres of bottomland (including two islands) in what became Tioga County. He also owned lands in New Jersey and near <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga</a>!</p>

<p>In March 1793, he was one of those called on to authenticate the <a href="../../wills/willjavvlk.html">will</a> filed by an Albany neighbor.
		
<p>Archibald Campbell filed a <a href="../../wills/willarcampbell.html">will</a> in February 1793. It identified his wife and eleven living children. He died on April 24, 1793 and was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7#v=onepage&q=campbell&f=false">buried</a> in the Presbyterian church plot. He was two months shy of his fifty-eighth birthday.</p>

      <p> <a href="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/roots-l/messages/98mar/77389">Information</a> 
        from Howard Campbell posted on Rootsweb in 1998. Copied as posted: "Desire 
        information on my ancestor Archibald Campbell born 1736 or 1745 in Albany 
        County New York - died March 27 1793 Schoharie NY. Married Christina Sternberg 
        (1750-1796) 8 January 1768. Children John (1769-1802) Jacob (1772-1803) 
        and nine others. 1790 lived city first ward. His occupation was as a deputy 
        surveyor (1770-1788) State. Fought the French Indian revolutionary wars. 
        Father willed him lands Jersey. Can anyone verify Archibalds date place 
        of birth? Do you know parents (name, birth marriage death) I to trace 
        family back Scotland so when [I] visit there next year . . . <br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   In 2012, <a href="https://campbellgenealogynotes.wordpress.com/tag/archibald-campbell-ny-merchant/">Campbell Genealogy Notes</a> presented a more comprehensive compilation of potential material on him. However, another <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Et8RAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA373&lpg=PA373&dq=%22archibald+campbell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=8mxuJfRcrR&sig=3HtdetgaHhvHiY1gWhmn82r85Ig&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZlIu_r7fPAhXCuB4KHZckCicQ6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&q=%22archibald%20campbell%22%20albany&f=false">printed resource</a> tells a different tale. At this point, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now saying that here we strive to focus on the Albany surveyor who was buried in Albany in 1793.</p></font size>
