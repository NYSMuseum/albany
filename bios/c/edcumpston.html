<strong>Edward Cumpston </strong></a> was born about 1753. He probably was of New England origins. Boston people spelled the name "<a href="http://bos-gw.rays-place.com/bos/bos-mar-20.htm">Compston</a>." We seek information on his early life.

<p>In May 1778, he was in Albany when he married young <a href="../vs/mavschaick4049.html">Maria Van Schaick</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  By 1789, five children had been christened  in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. During the 1780s and '90s, he was a member and pewholder of the Dutch church.

<p>The Cumpstons raised their family in a house located on <a href="../../im/imecourt.html">Court Street</a> and near the river. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7684">1788</a>, their home was accorded a moderate assessment. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7684">1790</a>, his household included six family members.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7684">1781</a>. he was among those <a href="../../newcomers.html">who</a> purchased the "Freedom" to conduct business in Albany. At that time, he was identified as a merchant. In February 1783, a newspaper item advertized that he was a merchant opposite the southeast corner of the Dutch Reformed Church and had for sale the best French brandy, wines, rock salt, sugar, ginger, indigo, and a small assortment of drygoods. He accepted several forms of payment and wanted to buy quantities of hemp. As late as 1790, he was advertizing in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. At that time, he called himself a "securities dealer." 

<p>During the 1780s, this one-time American officer seems to have purchased a number of soldier's land bounty rights beyond Albany. He also qualified for a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7684">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1785">1785</a>, he was chosen assessor for the first ward. During those years, he owned additional Albany properties and was a contractor of the city.

<p>By the mid 1790s, Mary Cumpston was dead and Edward had married Mary <a href="../b/bradt.html">Bradt</a>. Their child was born in 1796. About that time, he left Albany and relocated along the "Great Western Turnpike" in the new village of Esperance where he opened a store.


<p>Major Edward Cumpston died in Auburn, New York in August 1822. This former Albany resident had lived seventy-two years.</p>
