<strong>Abraham H. Cuyler</strong></a> was born in August 1733. He was the <a href="../../wills/willhecuyler530.html">eldest</a> son of <a href="hecuyler530.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vd/mgtvdu5548.html">Margarita Van Deusen</a> Cuyler. He grew up in a merchant's home on Pearl Street. He was known as "Abraham H. Cuyler" to prevent confusion with his prominent <a href="abccuyler359.html">cousin</a> and other same-named individuals. In 1761, he was <a href="../../wills/willhecuyler530.html">named</a> co-executor and heir of his father's estate.

      <p>In April 1762, he married <a href="../w/cawendell2779.html">Catharina Wendell</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1773, five 
        children had been christened in the church where he was a pewholder and 
        regular baptism sponsor. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1754">1754</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a>, he was named firemaster and may have served for several years. In 1764, he petitioned the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> to be replaced as firemaster  because he had entered militiary sevice. In 1763 he was commissioned captain in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. he seems to have served for more than a decade and was called "Major" in November 1775.

<p>In 1775, he was elected to represent the second ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. Re-elected annually, he held that position for the lifetime of the committee.

<p>[<font size=-1>At this point, we must take a step back rather than mis-attribute the abundant quality information we have extracted on individuals simply called "Abraham Cuyler".</font size>]

<p>Abraham H. Cuyler may have survived until the end of the century.
