      <P>Albany resident and patriarch <a href="#sources"><b>Patrick Clark</b></a> 
        probably was born during the 1720s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. However, a number of <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional 
        sources have pointed to an <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> background. 
      <p>His name appeared in an Albany merchant's account book in 1748. Over 
        the next few years he maintained a business relationship with the Albany 
        <a href="../t/teneyck.html#sources">Ten Eycks</a>. In August 1755, he 
        traveled to New York on behalf of <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>. 
        He was paid from provincial coffers for making two trips in "His Majesty's 
        Service" in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0I-wAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA792&lpg=PA792&dq=%22patrick+clark%22+albany&source=bl&ots=VTtX3vDT8G&sig=ugHAtvfUs9mLXWYhj2hXMIo5btg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Q-5aUabnDYXC4AOI5oCwBA&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBjgo#v=onepage&q=%22patrick%20clark%22%20albany&f=false">1763</a>.</p>
      <p>By 1749, he had married Albany native <a href="../w/cowaldron648.html">Cornelia 
        Waldron</a> and was raising a family. Although he was a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Anglican church, by 1769, their nine children had been baptized 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Cornelia 
        was a member.</p>
      <p>These Clarks settled in the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> 
        of Albany where Patrick owned a <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7635">home</a> 
        and at least <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7635l">two</a> separate 
        <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7635ll">lots</a>. He also may have 
        leased additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real</a> property 
        from the city government. He was a frequent contractor of the municipal 
        government - performing road work and otherwise using his horse and cart 
        for city business. During the 1760s, he belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. In 1775 and '76, he furnished firewood and supplies and performed 
        repairs for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. 
        As late as <a href="../../census1790.html#7635">1790</a>, his home was 
        a Southside <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7635">landmark</a>.</p>
      <p>Albany mainstay Patrick Clark was dead by April 25, 1796 when letters 
        of administration were issued on his estate. His <a href="paclark7636.html">descendants</a> 
        further established the family and the Clarks remained in the city for 
        many years.</p>
