<P>Based on subsequent sources, Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>James Cassidy</strong></a> was born in or about 1759. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, expect that he was of <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> ancestry.

<p>He was living in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> in August <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, when his name appeared on a list of freeholders. At that time, he was identified as a "<a href="../../econ/comec.html#mer">victualer</a>." In March <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, his name 
        appeared on a list of jurors eligible for service under the <a href="../../org/mayorct.html">Mayor's 
        Court</a>. Again, he was listed as a victualer. 
<p>An assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, valued his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a> and his personal moderately.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7568">1800</a>, his second ward household was configured on the Albany census. It included a couple and four children under sixteen. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> more defining information on his marriage and children. 


 <p>James Cassidy was an early (and perhaps founding) member of <a href="../../org/stmarys.html">St. Mary's</a> Catholic church. In November 1799, his name appeared on a <a href="../../org/stmarys.html#test">list</a> of principal church members. His wife appears to have been named Mary. Their twenty-one-year-old daughter, Catherine, was <a href="https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofcom00alba">buried</a> in the Catholic plot in September 1805. Mary had been buried a month earlier.



 
<p>James Cassidy <a href="../../dead.html">died</a> in August 1801 at the age of forty-two. He was <a href="../../res/death.html">buried</a> in the Catholic Church plot.</p>
