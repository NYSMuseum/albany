<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Geertruy Vosburgh</strong></a> was born during the first third of the seventeenth century. She was the wife of New Netherland pioneer <a href="../v/abpvosburgh.html">Abraham Pieterse Vosburgh</a> and matriarch of the Albany <a href="../v/vosburgh.html">Vosburgh</a> family. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources intimate that she was born in Europe in 1628 and was <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Geertruy-Vosburgh/6000000009412668274">member</a> of the Coeymans family. Perhaps, she was a <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/state/bios/fg/vosburgh001.txt">sister</a> of Barent P. Coeymans. At this point, we are <a href="../qqqq.html">not</a> at all certain of her background and marriage record.

<p>Her children were with Abraham Vosburgh and she seems to have been the mother of a <a href="../v/pivosburgh.html">number</a> of Albany area residents.

<p>Her husband was killed by Indians in 1659. The widow <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">assumed</a> some of his business obligations.

<p>A "Geertruy Vosburgh" is said to have had a short-lived marriage to widower <a href="../b/albanbradt4180.html">Albert A. Bradt</a>. That childless union ended in divorce.

<p>Abraham Pieterse was long dead by March <a href="../../census1679.html#11">1679</a> when "Geertruy Vosburgh" was identified as the owner of record of an Albany home.

<p>In 1683, she was among the <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> members who contributed to the <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#geco">support</a> of a second minister at Albany. Her contribution was posted near the end of the list under the heading "farmers below." By that time, she is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GIY-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=%22geertruy+vosburgh%22+kinderhook&source=bl&ots=S86aQ8quNg&sig=oDz6Ys4vKthpmrxg0LOXv-_xJoQ&hl=en&ei=17n4Tb6TEIry0gGBiP3XCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22geertruy%20vosburgh%22%20kinderhook&f=false">said</a> to have taken her Vosburgh children to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> where her sons became mainline residents.

<p>Geertruy Coeymans Vosburgh was not mentioned in the will filed by her son in 1690. However, she is said to have died about 1695.</p>
