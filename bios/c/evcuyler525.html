      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Eva Cuyler</b></a> was born in the New World before 
        1683. She was the daughter of <a href="../../newcomers.html">new</a>comer 
        trader <a href="hecuyler533.html">Hendrick Cuyler</a> and his wife <a href="../s/anschepmoes8629.html">Anna 
        Schepmoes</a> Cuyler. She grew up as the seventh child of a <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/cuyler.html">large</a> 
        and emerging early Albany family. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Pr</a>obably 
        born within a few years of 1680, we seek more definitive information on 
        the <a href="../../res/origins.html">part</a>iculars of her birth. </p>
      <p>In August 1712, she married <a href="../vd/pevdriessen6692.html">Petrus 
        Van Driessen</a> - the new Dominie of the Albany Dutch church. By 1722, 
        their five children had been christened in his <a href="../../drc.html">church</a>. 
        As the wife of the Dutch Reformed minister, Eva enjoyed high status in 
        the community. Their Albany home was attended by several servants and 
        adorned with fine furnishings and works of art.</p>
      <p>Eva lost her husband in February 1738. His <a href="../../wills/willpevdriessen.html">will</a> 
        left her the use of his entire and substantial estate during her widowhood. 
        That legacy included an Albany house and personal property, a house in 
        New York, and land on the Mohawk. "Sick and weak, she filed her <a href="../../wills/willevcuyler525.html">own 
        will</a> in April 1750. It parceled out her substantial legacy to children 
        and grandchildren.</p>
      <p>Although her name was not included on a census of Albany householders 
        made in <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, the widow Eva Cuyler 
        Van Driessen lived six more years before dying in August 1756. She was 
        buried from her husband's former church. </p>
