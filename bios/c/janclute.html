<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously (Knoet), the first <a href="#sources"><b>Jan Clute</b></a> was born in Europe and emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. Called "Captain Jan Clute," he is <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/clute_j1.html">said</a> to have come from "Neurenberg" and was in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> by 1656. During the third quarter of the seventeenth century, he was known as a frontier land and <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a>. 

<p>In 1657, he is said to have purchased a garden behind Fort Orange. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NZx3gehXILIC&pg=PA336&lpg=PA336&dq=%22jan+clute%22+beverwyck&source=bl&ots=DLG5Wp4I_B&sig=L0_R0h_JFn49lGSDeCmN1MjBGjo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=usXhUIvuB8bZ0QHXoYFI&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&q=%22jan%20clute%22%20beverwyck&f=false">1663</a>, he purchased a lot on the hill from Sander <a href="../g/glen.html">Glen</a>.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WBdCh9uazCQC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=%22jan+cloet%22&source=bl&ots=lEewJQa5nK&sig=w9QgJrbU-9iTWP4XsY4685Kct-I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=frvhUO39IM-O0QGnqYH4Bg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22jan%20cloet%22&f=false">1666</a>, he purchased a number of varied items from the estate of 
<a href="../b/cobogardus6362.html">Cornelis Bogardus</a>.


<p>In 1669, he purchased an island in the Mohawk at <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canastigione</a>. In 1670, he was one of a number of owners who sold land at Coxsackie. In 1681, he liquidated his holdings on the Murderers Creek - which flowed east into the Hudson.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html">1674</a>, "Lieutenant Jan Clute" was among those invited to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer.  

<p>He also was identified as a <a href="../../criteria.html">resident</a> of Albany. In <a href="../../census1679.html#1633">1679</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany householders and he was  assessed one of the highest taxes on the community-wide levy.</p>

<p>He probably did not marry. In <a href="../../wills/willjanclute.html">1683</a>, his brothers and sisters were living in "Niewen Roy," North Brabant, Holland.</p>

<p>He filed a <a href="../../wills/willjanclute.html">will</a> in 1683. It left a substantial estate to his <a href="janclute1634.html">nephew and namesake</a>. Jan Clute was dead by December 11, 1684 when his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">pro</a>bate!</p>
