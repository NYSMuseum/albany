<strong>Anna Cook</strong></a> or <a href="../../res/sp.html">Cock</a> probably was born during the 1730s. She was the wife and then Albany-based widow of <a href="../h/johewson2329.html">John Hewson</a>. 

<p>Between 1755 and 1763, three sons were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Her husband was an officer at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a>.

<p>John Hewson was a <a href="../../census1756.html#163">shoemaker</a> whose modest home was in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>She was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjohewson.html">will</a> filed by her husband in December 1777.  Hewson was dead by March of 1779 but the will did not pass probate until September 1799.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, "widow Huston's" name appeared on two Albany assessment rolls as the owner of a house and lot in the first ward. The personal property of two sons was noted under her parcel. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8616">1788</a>, "Daniel Hewson & Mother" were identified as the property holders. Two years later, the <a href="../../census1790.html#ah">census</a> identifed "Ann Hewson" as the head of a first ward household that included four men and four females and appeared to be located on or near upper State Street. Later, the address would be given as <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a>.

<p>Beginning in 1796, the widow began selling off her Lion Street holdings in what appears to have been a Hewson "estate" near the intersection of Lion and Dove Streets..

<p>Anna Cook Hewson died sometime after May 1802 when she made a last conveyance.
