<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelia Cooper</strong></a> was born in December 1748. She was the eldest daughter of <a href="jacooper485.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../o/joorchard469.html">Josina Orchard</a> Cooper. She mostly grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> near the homes of her future in-laws, the <a href="../h/hallenbeck.html">Hallenbecks</a>. 

<p>In December 1766, Cornelia married <a href="../h/anthallenbeck5247.html">Anthony Hallenbeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1788, eleven children had been christened in the church where both parents were members.

<p>Not surprisingly, these Hallenbecks raised their family in the first ward where they shared the Hallenbeck homestead with Anthony's mother and one of his brothers. In <a href="../../census1790.html#5247">1790</a>, their <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> home housed ten people. A decade later, only Cornelia, Anthony, and two small children were counted there on the <a href="../../census1800.html#5247">census</a>.

<p>Anthony Hallenbeck was dead by the beginning of 1809 when his will passed probate. After her husband's death, Neeltie's <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> no longer appeared on city rolls. Perhaps she was absorbed under the household of one of her many offspring who still were living on Hallenbeck property on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">south side</a> of Albany.

<p>In February 1840, the Albany newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA301&lpg=PA301&dq=%22mrs.+cornelia+hallenbake%22+volume+9&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22mrs%20cornelia%20hallenbake%22%20volume%209&f=false">noted</a> that Mrs. Cornelia Hallenbake" died, aged 92. She has been <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=pv&GRid=50621192&PIpi=26953983">memorialized</a> with the Hallenbecks in the Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>
