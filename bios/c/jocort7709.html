<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled (Courtney) and referred to variously, a <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Cortney</strong></a> was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=LNlSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=%22John+and+Maria+Courtnie%22&source=bl&ots=pG0QfroXt4&sig=MuCjFztSixH6JOCs2aOrODdBekM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIye_W58zKAhVIcz4KHcPPAGcQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22John%20and%20Maria%20Courtnie%22&f=false">christened</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in February 1744. That individual was the son of John <a href="../../inprog.html">and</a> Maria Vanderlinde Cortney. For now, this sketch proceeds under that <a href="../../res/guess.html">ass</a>umption.

<p>Perhaps he was the enlisted man "John Courtney" whose name appeared on the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bZAbAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA852&lpg=PA852&dq=%22courtney%22&source=bl&ots=nE-9GxMjSo&sig=VuI_v4jJ7BGuCdFbghy8eJ4AMFQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQ6sucoqTKAhVLNj4KHYy1AiEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22courtney%22&f=true">muster roll</a> of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company in August 1767. Also in that month, he was paid by the city government for "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=%22john+cortney+%22&source=bl&ots=wyhLdRvcgt&sig=INFqtZGOARCBDwkv8RgUgreGgvs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-puLops3JAhXDGx4KHfd-CvgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20cortney%20%22&f=false">bringing stone</a>" to the docks.

<p>In March 1768, Courtney and <a href="../b/jobromley5959.html">John Bromley</a> were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA184&lpg=PA184&dq=%22john+cortney+and+john+bromley%22&source=bl&ots=wyhLdRvcgt&sig=INFqtZGOARCBDwkv8RgUgreGgvs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-puLops3JAhXDGx4KHfd-CvgQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20cortney%20and%20john%20bromley%22&f=false">granted rights</a> to the Greenbush <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> for a year. Their contract was renewed in 1769 with the added requirement that they have two boats and "ample hands."
 
            <p>About 1775, he married <a href="../s/brseeger.html">Bridget Seeger</a>. By 1791, more than three <a href="https://archive.org/stream/contributionsfor00pearuoft#page/34/mode/1up/search/35">children</a> were christened in Albany churches.
			 
<p>About thirty at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, we expect to find wartime information relating to this Albany resident. Variable spellings of the surname in the most logical Revolutionary wartime <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">sources</a> cautious us against assigning qualitative information.

 <p>In October <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, he was assessed modestly ostensibly in association with <a href="../s/thseeger.html">Thomas Seeger</a> (the son of matriarch <a href="../w/brwheel.html">Bridget</a> and possibly Courtney's brother-in-law).

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7709">1788</a>, the personal property of "John Cortney" was among those accorded the most modest assessments perhaps under the boarding house of <a href="../../bios/t/rathomp.html">Ralph Thompson</a> and at the end of the first ward enumeration.

<p>The first Federal census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> does not appear to have counted the household of John Cortney anywhere in New York State. However, in <a href="../../census1800.html#7709">1800</a>, the first ward household of "John Cortney" included two children and a middle-aged couple. 

<p>Albany resident John Cortney was <a href="../../dead.html">dead</a> by the end of 1801 when the Dutch church posted a charge for a pall and hearse for John Cortney. In March, the church grave digger was paid for Courtney's funeral.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22courtney%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=courtney&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed the home of widow Bridget Cortney at 4 <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a>. The widow Courtney <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142&dq=%22bridget+segar%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjpv97O6bPLAhWBoD4KHR7lAI0Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=%22bridget%20segar%22&f=false">died</a> in 1834 at the age of seventy-seven.
