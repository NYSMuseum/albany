<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> Catharina </a><a href="#cadogan">Cadogan</a> was the wife of Watervliet and Albany resident Christopher Ruby. We seek defining information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, subsequent resources tell us that she was born about 1778.

<p>In December 1794, she married Albany native <a href="../r/chruby.html">Christopher Ruby</a> at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> where both partners were members and where her husband was a church officer. Church records noted that she was 17 years old in 1795. The marriage produced a number of children.

<p>These Rubys resided in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Water</a>vliet where Christopher's household was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#chru">1800</a>. At that time, three children, a male (Christopher) 26-45 years of age, and a woman over 45 were included in the family. 

<p>After that (actually following Lutheran records from the 1790s), Catherine's name has escaped our research. Her husband, however, was noted regularly in the community-based record until his death about 1833. Past diminishing returns online, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Catharina Cadogan Ruby.</p>

          family history resources. Only a few of those with that surname have

          none on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>). This 
          Catharina seems to have been one of more than three Albany Cadogan brides 
          (also <a href="../c/macadog.html">Mary/Polly</a> Brown and <a href="../c/nacadogen.html">Nancy</a> 
          Hilton) to have been so named. Perhaps <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a>
