<P><a href="#sources"><b>Geertje Coeymans</b></a> was born in April 1654. She was the daughter of landholder <a href="bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieterse Coeymans</a>.</p>

<p>About 1676, she married Manhattan shoemaker <a href="../t/jacote4807.html">Jacob C. Ten Eyck</a> who was in the process of relocating to Albany. Over the next two decades their children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and regular baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Ten Eycks were Albany residents who lived on the hill in what became the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.</p>

<p>Geertje lost her husband during the 1690s. She was an <a href="../../census1697.html#118">Albany mainstay</a> who continued to live in their Pearl Street home surrounded by her grown children and their families. She filed her<a href="../../wills/willgeercoey.html"> will</a> in September 1716. It devised her substantial estate to her four living children and to the child of another deceased son. 

<p>She lived two decades longer and died on February 27, 1736. Geertje Coeymans Ten Eyck was buried in the Dutch church cemetery a few days later. Her children and their offspring established the <a href="../t/teneyck.html">Ten Eyck</a> family in early Albany society.</p>
