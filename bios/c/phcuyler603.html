      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Philip Cuyler</b></a> was born in August 1733. 
        He was the eldest <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">surviving son</a> 
        of <a href="cocuyler388.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../s/caschuyler1244.html">Catharina 
        Schuyler</a> Cuyler. His future received an early boost when he was left a <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1747.html">bequest</a> by a Schuyler kinsman in 1739.  Growing up in a large <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a> family of a prominent merchant, Philip was sent to Newport, Rhode 
        Island to represent his father and to make new business connections. Otherwise, 
        he was <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">excluded</a> from his father's 
        substantial estate.</p>

<p>In September 1757, he married <a href="../t/satweedy.html">Sarah Tweedy</a> of Newport. These Cuylers first lived in Newport and in New York. He may have been the same Philip Cuyler who was a <a href="http://www.chipstone.org/publications/1996AF/Beckerdite/1996BeckerditeText.html">businessman</a> in New York during the <a href=../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. Their child was baptized in New York in 1760. Subsequent children were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KY1GAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=%22philip+cuyler%22&source=bl&ots=838awOi2Xe&sig=XIGBcV59lnk4vPosWH27nCJcu0k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjF44ie9I7YAhXH5SYKHeGMDMMQ6AEIRjAJ#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20cuyler%22&f=false">christened</a> in Albany.</p>
<p>In March 1765, he may have received an additional bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">will</a> filed by his father. Cornelis Cuyler died later that year. By that time, Philip had returned to Albany to stay. He was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>In his early thirties, Philip Cuyler followed family <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">business</a> 
        in the Indian trade and in its overseas connection as well. He took up 
        residence on lower <a href="../../streets.html"state">State Street</a>, 
        served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>, but otherwise 
        maintained a low civic profile. In 1770, his brother, <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham</a>, 
        was appointed mayor of Albany.</p>

<p>Unlike his brother, who was imprisoned as a royal official, Philip was 
        able to avoid conflict with the <a href="../../or/or.html">revolutionaries</a> 
        and even subscribed a small sum for the relief of Fort Ticonderoga in 
        1775. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city regiment of the Albany County 
        militia.</p>
<P>In February 1782, he was among those left a share of the estate of the legendary <a href="../s/mgtschuyler.html">Madame Schuyler</a>. At that time, he also was named co-executor of her <a href="../../wills/willmgtschuyler1488.html">will</a>. In <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html">1793</a>, he was still performing those duties.

      <p>Aged fifty at the end of the war, Philip Cuyler seems to have dropped 
        from the local business scene. He did acquire another lot from the city. 
        In <a href="../../census1790.html#603">1790</a> and in <a href="../../census1800.html#603">1800</a>, 
        the census showed Philip and his wife living alone in a house in the second 
        ward on <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Barrack Street</a>. In 1801 and 1802, his house included a <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/6771/41761_328301-00434?pid=349652&backurl=https://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv%3D1%26dbid%3D6771%26h%3D349652%26tid%3D%26pid%3D%26usePUB%3Dtrue%26_phsrc%3DQKC40%26_phstart%3DsuccessSource&treeid=&personid=&hintid=&usePUB=true&_phsrc=QKC40&_phstart=successSource&usePUBJs=true">boarder</a> ("Weston"?).</p>

<p>After 1803, we have not encountered his name in the community-based record.</p>
