<P><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources state that <a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Coster</b></a> was born in South Holland in 1636. By the 1660s, he had emigrated to New Netherland and had settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>.</p>



<p>By 1668, he had married eighteen-year-old <a href="../vs/geervschaick4032.html">Geertje Goosens Van Schaick</a> - daughter of a prominent Albany fur trader and the mother of his four children. In 1664, he had taken title to a parcel of "low" land located along the road north of <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>. The grantor was Goosen Gerritse, his future father-in- law. In 1668, Coster and his young wife were named in the joint <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">will</a> filed by her parents. These Costers raised their family in an Albany home. His <a href="antcoster5968.html">son</a> and daughters would establish themselves in the city of Albany.</p>

<p>He was on one of the lists of people invited to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer in October 1678. However, Hendrick Coster may have died about that time as, shortly afterward, and his widow married trader <a href="../l/jolansing3440.html">Jan Lansing</a>. In April 1679, Lansing <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nkHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%22hendrick+coster%22+albany&source=bl&ots=-hFOq_O4u1&sig=lcbbXyMzGkw8qTO11fPr3pYRy7U&hl=en&ei=k2fIS7a6CIT68AaxruGFBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22hendrick%20coster%22%20albany&f=false">sold off</a> his house, lot, and orchard on the hill in Albany.

<p>His only surviving <a href="antcoster5968.html">son</a> became an Albany resident.</p>
