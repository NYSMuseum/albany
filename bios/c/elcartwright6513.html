<P>Albany native <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Cartwright</strong></a> was christened in May of 1750. She was the daughter of <a href="ricartwright6508.html">Richard</a> and <a href="../b/anbeasley6509.html">Hannah Beasley</a> Cartwright. She grew up a middle child in the English speaking home of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> innkeeper. Her parents were mainstays at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>After receiving a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">marr</a>iage license in October 1767, she became the wife of <a href="#tr">one</a> "Thomas Robisson." <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cAcXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=%22elizabeth+cartwright%22+thomas+robisson&source=bl&ots=JfCt5FK57a&sig=O8qNA2AP-v-dSKNQyc3KMgF4qKU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xX3DUJugPPCO0QG7moHgAg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22elizabeth%20cartwright%22%20thomas%20robisson&f=false">Perhaps</a>, her daughter was born in Albany in 1768.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, her London-born <a href="../../or/or-icw.html#or-6508">father</a> came under immediate suspicion despite having lived in Albany since the 1740s. By that time, she probably had moved west with her husband.  

<p>In February <a href="#cc">1777</a>, a <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=36437">letter</a> from her teen-aged <a href="ricartwrightjr.html">brother</a> to her ("Elizabeth Robisson") at Niagara was intercepted by the <a href="../../coc.html">Rev</a>olutionaries.

<p>After that, her name has thus far eluded our sweep of community-based and <a href="../../res/irs.html">online</a> resources.  

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> further information on the life and passing of Albany native Elizabeth Cartwright Robisson. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cAcXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=%22elizabeth+cartwright%22+thomas+robisson&source=bl&ots=JfCt5FK57a&sig=O8qNA2AP-v-dSKNQyc3KMgF4qKU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=xX3DUJugPPCO0QG7moHgAg&ved=0CEYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22elizabeth%20cartwright%22%20thomas%20robisson&f=false">Perhaps</a>, her abovementioned child was buried in Boston in 1819. </p>

If so, he was called "Captn" and a friend of Richard Cartwright, Jr. in Canada.
