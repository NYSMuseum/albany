<strong>John Cammeron</strong></a> was born about 1765. He possibly was the son of pre-war Scottish <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Xxem9Kqd0j0C&pg=PA448&lpg=PA448&dq=%22alexander+cameron%22+albany&source=web&ots=62pWHR72rP&sig=gls-KNU9L_4L2UyNmDOhTbj5wuM&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result">emigre</a>, Tory,  and later Albany resident <a href="../c/alcam7512.html">Alexander Cammeron</a> (also the name of John's first son).

<p>We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on the pre-war and wartime exploits of John and his family.

<p>In July 1788, John Cammeron married <a href="../m/ismills.html">Isabella Mills</a> at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. The following May, his son was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. By 1796, at least two additional children had been christened at the Presbyterian church.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7513">1788</a>, the city assessment roll referenced "John Cameren (painter)" with other personal property-only residents at the end of the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In 1791, Presbyterian church records also identified him as a painter. In 1791 and 1796, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">common council</a> records referenced him as the city watchmen. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7513">1790</a>, his fledgling household was first configured on the Albany census. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued at twenty dollars and he was listed on the assessment roll as a boarder in a house on <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Barrack Street</a>. The <a href="../../census1800.html#7513">next year</a>, his second ward household included three children and the parents. 
 
<p>After 1800, the name of John Cammeron no longer appears in the <a href="../../cbr.html">co</a>mmunity based record.</p>
