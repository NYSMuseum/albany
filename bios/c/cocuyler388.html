<P><A href="#biography"><B>Cornelis Cuyler</B></A> was born in 1697 and baptized in the New York City Dutch church. He was the eldest surviving son of the twelve children born to Albany mainstays <a href="jocuyler546.html">Johannes Cuyler</a> and his wife, <a href="../t/elstbroeck42.html">Elsie Ten Broeck</a> Cuyler. In 1736, he was left only his birthright in the <a href="../../wills/willjocuyler546.html">will</a> of his father.</P>

<P>Cornelis followed <a href="#enterprise">family enterprise</a> in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> - often requiring him to travel into the Indian country during the <a href="../../peace.html">decades of peace</a> following Queen Anne's War. Frequent absences brought him success but delayed settling down and starting a family until he was almost thirty.</P>

          <p>In December 1726, he married Albany native and mayor's daughter <a href="../s/caschuyler1244.html">Catharina 
            Schuyler</a>. Between 1727 and 1747, their eleven children were baptized 
            in the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch church</a> where both parents 
            were pewholders and frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>Success in trade, advantageous marriages, and a willingness to conform to community standards brought the Cuylers acceptance in eighteenth century Albany. Cornelis began to take his place by serving as a constable in the second <a href="../../wards.html">ward</a> in 1717. In 1724, he was asked to swear not to trade with the French and subsequently was sent into the Mohawk country and to Canada to represent Albany's interests.</p>

          <p>Following his marriage, he purchased land above his father's <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
            Street</a> home and built his own house south of what became Steuben 
            Street. During the 1730s and 40s, that location, four lots above Chapel, 
            would have been one of the <a href="../../images/jpg/map1759.jpg">westernmost 
            homes</a> in the core city. He was elected and served as alderman 
            for the second ward from 1729 to 1735. During and after his time on 
            the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a>, he was an active 
            member of the Albany <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian 
            Affairs</a>.</p>

<p>By the 1740s, Cornelis was the head of the Albany <a href="cuyler.html">Cuyler family</a> and had risen to the top echelon of early Albany society. His parents both were the children of Albany mayors and his recently deceased father was mayor of Albany in 1725. In 1742, Cornelis Cuyler was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html#cocu">mayor</a> of Albany and served until 1746.</p>

          <p>After his time at city hall, fifty-year-old Cornelis now focused on establishing 
            his four able sons in business and in appointive and salaried offices. 
            Those initiatives and his ongoing role in Indian diplomacy brought 
            him into frequent contact with <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> 
            as both client and adversary. 
          <p>Cornelis Cuyler's remaining years brought <a href="../../census1756.html#141">recognition</a> of his long and diversified career. His wife died in 1758. In March 1765, sixty-eight-year-old Cornelis was sick. He wrote his <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">will</a> on March 12 - leaving his house, storehouse, and estate to seven surviving children. He died on March 14 and was buried from the the Albany Dutch church.</p>
