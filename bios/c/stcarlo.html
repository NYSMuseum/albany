<P>The <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> of 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Stephen Carlo</strong></a> was found on the Albany city <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> in 1790. 

<p>This individual was born prior to the mid-1760s. His name sometimes was <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled with a "w."

<p>Perhaps he served in the Revolutionary army as his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ySgwAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=%22stephen+carlow%22&source=bl&ots=co97XTDTB0&sig=Op_5CTlStL8Ai3Iglw-dxj2PDcU&hl=en&ei=TbIrS83KJ5DclAeyw8iVBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CB8Q6AEwCThG#v=onepage&q=%22stephen%20carlow%22&f=false">accounts</a> were later paid. 

<p>During the 1780s, he married Abigail Rider at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. At that time, he was <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/br_ch.html">said</a> to have been "gebortigs' koningh's Brugge." Their six children were christened in Schenectady during the 1780s.

<p>At some time during the 1780s, he seems to have settled in Albany. 

<p>In 1790, the first ward <a href="../../census1790.html#sc">household</a> of Stephen Carlo was configured on the Albany census. It included eight family members. Two years earlier, his personal property was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#sc">valued</a> (at 1 shilling) under the upper State Street house of the recently deceased <a href="../s/josanders.html">John Sanders</a>. 


<p>After 1790, his name drops from the community-based resources thus far encountered. However, the <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/ny/washington/census/1810/greenwich.txt">census</a> for Greenwich, Washington County in 1810 configured the household of Stephen Carlow with two children and two adults aged 26-45.
