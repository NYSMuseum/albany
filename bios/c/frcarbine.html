<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Francis Carbine</strong>(s)</a>  was born in 1733. He is <a href="http://www.geni.com/genealogy/people/Francis-Carbine/6000000006175862249">said</a> to have been a native of Truro in Cornwall, England and to have been the son of Francis and Eleanor Adams Carbine. Sometimes he was referred to as "Francis Carbine, Jr."

 <p>He is <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ny/chickened/stoutfamily.html">said</a> 
        to have married New Jersey native Mary Stout in Somerset County in March 
        1770. The marriage produced a number of <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=DESC&db=:2132463&id=I107705797">children</a> 
        whose names have not been found in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church</a> 
        records. "Francis and Eleonora Carbin" witnessed a baptism at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in June 1788.
		
<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on <a href="../../res/origins.html">what</a> brought him to America and then to Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>. 		
		 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#fc">1781</a>, he was among those <a href="../../newcomers.html">new</a>comers who purchased the "Freedom of Albany." At that time, he was identified as a merchant.

<p>However, his time in Albany appears to have been of short duration. He soon left Albany and settled his family in one or more places in the southern part of Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Co</a>unty that became Greene County in 1800. Once relocated, he seems to have been a merchant and landholder. In 1792, he was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/catskill_packet.htm">living</a> near Catskill Landing. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his household consisting of two men and a woman was <a href="http://dgmweb.net/Census/Corbin/NY/Corbin-NY-1790.html">listed</a> on the Albany County census under Schoharie.

<p>Francis Carbine died in May 1795 at the age of sixty-two. A <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/burnewsp.html">notice</a> in an Albany newspaper called him "formerly a merchant in Albany." He is <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/cairo_cemetery.htm">said</a> to have been interred in Cairo, Greene County and to have been a Revolutionary war patriot. In August, letters of administration were issued on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a>. His widow, Mary, survived until 1816. </p>
