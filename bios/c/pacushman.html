      <P>Perhaps <a href="#sources"> <strong>Paul Cushman</strong></a> was born 
        about 1767. He is <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:Jaq-pb-RMRoJ:antiquesandfineart.com/articles/media/images/00901-01000/00947/Scherer_Stoneware.pdf+%22paul+cushman%22+albany&cd=24&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">thought</a> 
        to have have been born in Charlestown, New Hampshire and raised on a farm 
        in Vermont. He does not seem to have received training as a potter before 
        arriving in Albany within a few years of 1800. Perhaps he started out 
        as a laborer on the Albany <a href="../../streets.html#quay">waterfront</a>. 
      <p>He is <a    href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Wb4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=%22paul%2Bcushman%22%2Balbany&source=bl&ots=Y9denXTIww&sig=peEDfNI2rAMqMhuzMYexnjvY6Fs&hl=en&ei=S_WGSt3jOISvtgf-z9XnDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#v=onepage&q=%22paul%20cushman%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> 
        to have married Margaret Mc Donald in 1802. The marriage produced a number 
        of children.

        In 1805, he is <a href="http://antiquesandthearts.com/Antiques/CoverStory/2007-02-12__15-32-57.html">said</a> 
        to have purchased the stoneware operation begun by <a href="wmcapron7544.html">William 
        Capron</a> (the younger). By <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=%22paul+cushman%22+albany&id=0iFDAAAAIAAJ&ots=_ZOrQvBIq8#v=onepage&q=%22paul%20cushman%22%20albany&f=false">1809</a>, 
        Paul Cushman was running a stoneware factory "one half mile west of the 
        Albany <a href="../../loc/jail.html">G</a>aol." 
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, his Albany household 
        was first configured on the city census. In that year, his family included 
        four children aged ten and younger. 
      <p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%22cushman&source#v=onepage&q=false">1813</a>, 
        the address of "Paul Cushman, Potter," on upper Lion <a href="../../streets.html#lion">then</a> 
        Washington Streets was a fixture in Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city 
        directories</a>. 
      <p>In September 1824, a State Supreme Court awarded innkeeper <a href="../b/sabromley5963.html">Samuel 
        Bromley</a> a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=SMQCiOh-RXgC&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22samuel+bromley%22+albany&source=bl&ots=lZWvXGLfCq&sig=tgs2PVECE6zVFASaWjGkXpl5SbY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj0sfmd8P7JAhXJRiYKHWhkCqgQ6AEINDAF#v=onepage&q=samuel%20bromley&f=false">judgment</a> 
        of $600 from his previous loan to Cushman. 
      <p>Paul Cushman died in March 1833. His age at death was given in the newspaper 
        obituary was seventy-eight. However, we believe he was born in 1767. His 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in 
        July. 
      <p>Paul Cushman perhaps was early Albany's premier pottery merchant. He 
        was <a href="http://antiquesandthearts.com/Antiques/CoverStory/2007-02-12__15-32-57.html">"first 
        and foremost a pottery owner."</a> Whether he actually made any of "his" 
        stone pieces is open to question. Well-known in his day and having left 
        a substantial material legacy, his wares and career are the subjects of 
        a collection of <a href="#2007">essays</a> published in 2007. </p>
