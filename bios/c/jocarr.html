<P>According to a later document, <a href="#sources"><b>John Carr</b></a> or "Kerr" was born about 1663. He was from Londonderry, Ireland.</p>


<p>In July 1694, he married the Widow <a href="../c/elclaese.html">Elizabeth Classen</a> Harris at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, the marriage may not have produced any children.</p>

<p>In 1697, his Albany house was configured on the city <a href="../../census1697.html#032">census</a>. It showed a man, a woman, and no children. That survey also noted that he was of "English" ancestry. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6051">1699</a>, "Caer" signed a loyalty oath. He also affixed his name to petitions sent from Albany to the royal governor in 1700 and 1701.</p>

<p>During those years, he sought to engage in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian trade</a>. However, he was fined for  trading without possessing the freedom of the city. He also appeared before the Albany court on financial matters.</p>

<p>He probably died after September 1702 when he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willedreims.html">will</a> of a military contractor. However, in <a href="../../census1756.html#72">1756</a>, a individual named "John Carr" was identified as an Albany householder and weaver.</p>
