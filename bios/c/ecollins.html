          <P><B>Edward Collins</B> was born in Albany, the eldest of the three 
            children of of <a href="jcollins.html">John</a> and <a href="../s/mgtschuyler1455.html">Margarita 
            Schuyler Verplanck</a> Collins. He grew up in a comfortable Albany 
            home - nurtured by his mother's extensive family and in the company 
            of his older <a href="#brothers">half-brothers</a>.</P>

          <p><a href="#portrait"><img SRC="../../images/jpg/ecollins.jpg" ALT="Edward Collins" VSPACE=4 HSPACE=4 BORDER=1 width=200 align=right></a>Before 
            long, young Edward would accompany his father - an officer in the 
            garrison companies, to the Albany fort, to Schenectady, and out to 
            the frontier where he experienced the life of a peacetime soldier. 
            In the meantime, he also learned the principles and practices of his 
            father's other varied enterprises.</p>

<p>On the death of John Collins in 1728, Edward was able to take over all of his activities. He performed survey work; continued the Collins legal practice; was commissioned an officer - becoming a captain and then serving as the Albany "town major"; and was appointed to the Commissioners of Indian Affairs. This Albany native also performed legal and contract work for the <a href="#contract">city government</a>. Like his father, these occupations would make him quite wealthy. In addition, he was an active partner in the Walloomsac Patent granted in 1739.</p>
  
<P>At age twenty-nine, he married twenty-year-old <a href="../b/mgtbleecker212.html">Margarita 
            Bleecker</a> on December 9, 1733. The marriage produced no children 
            but both partners acted as godparents at a number of baptisms in the 
            Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Like many garrison 
            soldiers, Edward Collins became a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
            Peters</a> Anglican church - where he served as a church warden for 
            the remainder of his life.</P>

<p>By the mid-1740s, his enterprises had matured and Edward Collins devoted himself to managing his assets. He occasionally acted as attorney and agent - including representing the <a href="../../na/westen.html">Westenhook patentees</a> in New York. In 1746, he was appointed "<a href="../../corporation.html">Recorder</a>" or deputy mayor of Albany. He may have held that office until his death. He later characterized himself as a "gentleman," which would have set him apart from most of his Albany neighbors.</p>
 
<p>Edward Collins died in March 1753 a few months shy of his fiftieth birthday. His extensive estate consisting of land and tenaments, gold and silver, household furniture, and negroes and negro wenches was <a href="../../wills/willecollins.html">left</a> to the discretion of his wife Margaret - his sole heir.</p>
