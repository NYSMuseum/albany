<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Campbell</strong></a> was a feltmaker in Albany during the <a href="../../or/or.html">Am</a>erican Revolution. Most likely, he was born before 1750. We have <a href="../qqqq.html">yet</a> to link him to specific origins but believe he was of <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish ancestry.

<p>A number of same-named individuals appear to be at risk in the upriver regions prior to the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. 

<p>In November <a href="../../org/cc.html#1778">1778</a>, a James Campbell living in Albany and was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7532">1779</a>, his first ward property and belongings were valued on the city assessment roll. He also owned a <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jc7532">lot</A> in the third ward.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7532">1781</a>, he was among those newcomers who purchased the "Freedom of the city." That document identified him as a feltmaker.

<p>He may have been married to a woman named "Mable." However, their family life thus far has escaped our search of the available records of the Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.  

<p>In June 1784, Campbell and his wife <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">con</a>veyed a piece of property in <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> to John Mc Kinney. A month later, he posted a bond for James Wood of Cambridge. At that time, Campbell was identified as an Albany merchant.

<p>After that, his name appears to drop from the community-based roll. He does not seem to have been closely related to contemporary surveyor and Southside innkeeper <a href="arcampbell7528.html">Archibald Campbell</a>.


<p>A number of <a href="http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/nyh/90.1-2/campbell.html">senerios</a> for the later life of James Campbell are possible. Which <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NYPCUJQvP6UC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=%22james+campbell%22+schenectady&source=bl&ots=IUBS21pGhZ&sig=VZG_RFsVXqwoZqk8GBe7yE68lA8&hl=en&ei=GDx5TLO6DsKBlAetqezrCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22james%20campbell%22%20schenectady&f=false">ones</a> (if any) continue the story of the Albany merchant and feltmaker are still open <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.</p>
