<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Charles</strong></a> probably was born during the 1730s. He seems to have been a native of Scotland.

<p>In February 1762, he was in New York and secured a license to marry Albany native <a href="../h/mahogan1118.html">Mary Hogan</a>. The marriage produced at least one surviving son. He was a communicant of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>He was <a href="../../cddc.html">known</a> at his church and in the community as a <a href="../../trades/meat.html">butcher</a>. He also kept boarders and/or apprentices. In October 1774, his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA267-IA1&dq=267&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false">account</a> was paid by the city.

<p>Beginning during the mid-<a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his holdings in the first ward were <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7590">valued</a> on city assessment rolls. In 1767, he was listed on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>January 1776, he was <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;rgn=full%20text;idno=abp1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=332;page=root;size=100;frm=frameset">identified</a> as a second lieutenant in an Albany company of Grenadiers. At that time, he signed the required loyalty test.  In June and in August 1780, he was among those who agreed to post a <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting02paltrich#page/444/mode/2up">bond</a> promising his good behavior.

<p>William Charles was dead by <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1118">1788</a> when his widow was listed on the first ward assessment roll. The Albany 
<a href="../../census1790.html#1118">census</a> in 1790, configured her <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> household.

<p>Letters of administration were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">granted</a> in September 1792. Mary and <a href="geocharles7588.html">George Charles</a> were named executors. An <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html">estate inventory</a> dated March 29, 1793 noted household materials, books and included an extensive book of debts. </p>
