      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelia Clark</strong></a> probably was 
        born during the 1740s. Perhaps, she was the daughter of relative newcomer 
        <a href="pclark7635.html">Patrick Clark</a> - the name of one of her sons. 
        In that case, her mother would have been Albany native <a href="../w/cowaldron648.html">Cornelia 
        Waldron</a>. She most often would be <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> 
        as "Eleanor" or "Neeltie." 
      <p>In March 1766, "Neeltje" married her <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> neighbor <a href="../h/behallenbeck5249.html">Bernardus Hallenbeck</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By the mid-1780s, 
        eight children had been christened in the Albany church where she was 
        a pewholder. 
      <p>These Hallenbecks lived for more than twenty-five years on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South 
        side</a> of Albany in a modest house on the west side of what became <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South 
        Pearl Street</a>. 
      <p>Neeltie lost her husband October 1792. She became <a href="../../census1800.html#cocl">head</a> 
        of a first ward household that included only one somewhat younger woman. 
        Neeltie Clark Hallenbeck <a href="http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=norris40&id=I09810">may 
        have died</a> in Albany in August 1801.</p>
