<strong>Martin Cregier, Jr.</strong></a><a href="../../res/sp.html">*</a> was the son of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneer</a> Capt. Marte Cregier. He probably grew up on Manhattan Island where his father was a prominent figure.

<p>In September 1671, he married Jannetie Hendricks Van Doesburgh at the Dutch church in New York City. They had at least seven children. Their last three were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> from 1686 to 1693. He was an Albany church member and baptism sponsor.

<p>He first settled on his father's property in <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a>. In <a href="../../census1679.html#34">1679</a>, we believe the son was listed on a subscription roll as an Albany householder. From inclusion on a "burgher's list" in <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#5312">1681</a> to an assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, he appears to have been an Albany mainstay for the next two decades. His home was configured on the city census taken in <a href="../../census1697.html#123">1697</a>. He bought and sold houses and lots within the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a>. His name also appeared on petitions regarding the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> during the early 1700s.  

<p>
<p>Martin Cregier, Jr. filed a will in January 1702. His widow was listed on an assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#jc">1709</a>. His will passed probate in March 1711.</p>
