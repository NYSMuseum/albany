<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Cooper</strong></a> was born about 1714. She was the daughter of former soldier <a href="obcooper495.html">Obadiah</a> and <a href="../g/corgardinier.html">Cornelia Gardinier</a> Cooper. Perhaps she was the eldest of twelve children who would live in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home of a tailor and a daughter of the Albany countryside. 

<p>About 1735, Anna married <a href="../l/evlansing3245.html">Evert Lansing</a>. Between 1736 and 1744, at least seven children were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were regular baptism sponsors until at least 1754. However, another daughter was <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part4.html#baptismal">baptized</a> to Evert and Anna in February 1756 when Anna may have been in her forties.

<p>During the middle third of the eighteenth century, these Lansings would raise their family in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">East Manor</a> on a <a href="../../im/im1767.html">farm</a> inland from Papsknee Island. 

<p>Family <a href="../../res/ts.html">traditions</a> tell us that Evert Lansing died in 1768 and that Anna Cooper Lansing lived into the 1790s. We seek documentation on their passings. Their son <a href="../l/jolansing3751.html">John E. Lansing</a> was an Albany resident who later also lived on the east manor.</p>
