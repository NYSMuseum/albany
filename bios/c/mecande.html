<!-- Start Main Content -->
<P>According to family-based resources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Medad Cande</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> Candee)  was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R9cUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=medad+stillwater&source=bl&ots=raf_wQW56F&sig=PcBn82bK8u4Vy9J0Ktxd0BfrXQI&hl=en&ei=cC9fSqrNGKfEtgex0bjgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2">born</a> in May 1768. His family probably was from Connecticut.

<p>In any event, by <a href="../../census1800.html#3320">1800</a>, Medad was married and living in Albany when his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>  household consisting of eight people was configured on the city census. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1810</a>, his household accounted for nineteen people - including two free persons of color.

<p>His wife was <a href="http://saratoganygenweb.com/PrsbyStill.htm">Betsey Bristol</a>. Their son, Lansing, was buried from the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">P</a>resbyterian church in September 1803.
 
<p>Beginning with the first issue in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, city directories <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22cande,+medad%22&source=bl&ots=2hLxOZXx9A&sig=1u1u_V4JYutjq_trCGqkeuehJ04&hl=en&ei=JzFfSpOOH46itgfMkZzgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4">identified</a> him as an innkeeper living at 66 Court Street which became 484 South Market Street in 1815. Subsequent directories identified him as an officer of an Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic Lodge</a>. By 1820, he no longer was listed in the Albany directory.

<p>By that time, he probably had moved to <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nysarato/Sylvester/chap33.html">Stillwater</a> in Saratoga County where he was well-known as a tanner and shoemaker.

<p>Medad Cande died in April 1852. He had lived eighty-four years. Like other family members, he was <a href="http://saratoganygenweb.com/PrsbyStill.htm">buried</a> in a family plot at the Presbyterian cemetery north of Stillwater.
