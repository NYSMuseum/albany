<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jan Clute, Jr.</b></a> was the <a href="../../wills/willjanclute.html">nephew and heir</a> of Jan Clute. He is <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/greene-1.html">said</a> to have been born in Holland and emigrated to New Netherland with his uncle about 1656.</p>


<p>About 1680, he married <a href="../vs/bavslicht.html">Bata Van Slichtenhorst</a>. By 1704, nine of their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>Following the death of his uncle about 1684, Jan Clute, Jr. took over his Albany property and a number of more rural holdings as well. In 1684, he owned and sold a plot of land outside Albany's north gate. By that time, he is believed to have taken up residence on his uncle's <a href="../../wills/willjanclute.html#farm">farm</a> at <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canastigione</a>. </p>

<p>He was primarily a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who ranged far from Albany in search of furs. Such activities proved dangerous. In June 1682, he was identified as a "boslooper" who was being held prisoner in Canada.</p>

<p>He seems to have settled at Canastigione. He was buried there in November 1726. He was survived by three sons and five daughters who further established the family in the Mohawk Valley. Some descendants took up residence in Albany!</p>
