<strong>William Corry</strong></a> was born about 1710. He was from Ireland but may have been of English background. 

<p>By 1737, he was in New York (". . . had recently emigrated from Ireland") and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Mt89AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=%22william+corry%22&source=web&ots=y0HEkqHILP&sig=owjmjAlb8Wb9vHYr_5XYPQPiJlM#PPA36,M1">petitioning</a> for a grant of 100,000 acres in "Mohawk County" with the understanding that he would be bringing a number of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UQEEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=%22william+corry%22+albany&source=web&ots=uapc_o20eu&sig=N7KC8sqWDfYv8G4ieOHdzg1sm6Y#PPA122,M1">families</a> from Ireland. The petition eventually was disallowed. But he did head a dozen petitioners who received a patent for almost 26,000 acres that same year. Corry also purchased a tract of land closer to Schenectady where he founded a settlement called "Corry's Bush" and later became Princetown.

<p>Corry frequently was characterized as an <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a>. He was said to have been "English-trained" - although the precise  nature and extent of his training and practice are still not known. He sustained a long-standing legal, business, real estate, and personal  relationship with Mohawk Valley magnate <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>. He was a frequent and familiar <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BlQOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22william+corry%22+%22william+johnson%22&source=web&ots=4SnA-W4swi&sig=lboKiY9rHdc5dxzkQ-B4tnFQRME#PPA566,M1">correspondant</a> and source of information. For example, in August 1757, he wrote to Johnson and offered a slate of potential judicial appointees. He was one of a number of Albany-based countrymen who kept Sir William <a href="../../sources.html#jp">in</a>formed about the Albany scene.

<p>His wife was named Catherine - whom he probably <a href="../../wills/willwmcorry.html">married</a> in 1734.. The marriage produced a son named Isiah and four daughters. In 1739 and 1743, two daughters were christened in the <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/CURRY/2001-03/0986059097">church</a> at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a>. In 1750, his daughter was christened in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> by Rev. <a href="../o/jogilvie.html">John Ogilvie</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#137">1756</a>, his name appeared on a census of Albany householders. At that time, he was identified as a lawyer and his house was judged to be appropriate for quartering four soldiers but not officers. 

<p>In July 1760, he lived on the north side of the house of Abraham Lansing.

<p>William Corry was "sick and ailing" when he filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmcorry.html">will</a> in 1763. In May, the <i>New York Mercury</i> reported that Corry had died in Albany on April 24 after a short illness. He was in his fifty-third year.  His will passed probate on October 26. Corry's widow and son sought William Johnson's advice on William Corry's estate. </p>
