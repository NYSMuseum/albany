<P><A href="#biography"><B>Anna Coster</B></A> probably was born during the early 1670s. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="hecoster5974.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vs/geervschaick4032.html">Geertje Van Schaick</a> Coster. 


          <p>In 1693, she wed Albany trader <a href="../b/jjbleecker199.html">Johannes Bleecker 
            Jr.</a> Probably in her teens at the time of her marriage, Anna bore 
            children over a twenty-five year period. By 1718, nine of her children 
            were baptized in the Albany <a href="#church">Dutch church</a> where 
            both parents were prominent members.</p>

These Bleeckers lived on the west side of  <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> at the corner of Maiden Lane. Anna's husband was a leading businessman and city official.<p></p>

Johannes Bleecker died in 1738. Anna survived him and was a <a href="../../census1756.html#128">fixture</a> in their Pearl Street house. She outlived several of her children as well - perhaps <a href="#death">dying</a> as late as 1766.<p></P>
