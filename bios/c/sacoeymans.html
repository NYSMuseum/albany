<P>According to family-based resources, <a href="#sources"><strong>Samuel Coeymans</strong></a> was born in August 1670. He was a younger son of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieters</A> and <a href="../d/geerdvos.html">Geertruy De Vos</a> Coeymans. He seems to have grown up on his father's holdings on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manor</a> and beyond.

<p>His father lived into the eighteenth century and this younger son seem to have remained under the family umbrella until he was in his forties.

<p>In 1715, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 

<p>By that time, he seems to have <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/FindingAids/TEN%20EYCK%20%20MG%208.pdf">taken charge of</a> extensive <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lands</a> in the southern part of the county that has come to be known as the "<a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans Patent</a>."

<p>Samuel also owned property within the Albany city limits. But mostly, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nFALQtEI9LcC&pg=PA132&lpg=PA132&dq=%22samuel+coeymans%22&source=bl&ots=q9N6frI70O&sig=-GFEIHxgrcMJ9uideh3CFHbJLTI&hl=en&ei=xviNTZO0JbKN0QG0s8i7Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20coeymans%22&f=false">lived</a> with his sister <a href="arcoey.html">Ariaantie</a> in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gH4FAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=%22family+castle%22&source=bl&ots=C0bmbNdiqS&sig=jqpRLyKmgU9PRfX-W-DYu-rqqgU&hl=en&ei=YhCOTaSTPJSO0QHC_JS9Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">family mansion</a> that was built above the west side of the Hudson in the present-day village of Coeymans. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6161">1742</a>, his name appeared on lists of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck freeholders.  

<p>In August 1724, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UfJwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22samuel+coeymans%22&source=bl&ots=U4b0p5ormL&sig=4GG4MRgX9B_o5XoEg4ujvUKkchY&hl=en&ei=uMWNTevjMMnE0QHXn5DACw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CC8Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20coeymans%22&f=false">left</a> fifty pounds in the will of Janetie Benson, his widowed sister .


<p>In December 1724, Samuel would have been in his fifties when he married a much younger <a href="../vs/cavschaick4007.html">Catharina Van Schaick</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Probably due to his age, their marriage was childless. However, the marriage endured until his death three decades later.

<p>During the second quarter of the eighteenth century, he seems to have been most concerned with <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/beers_history_of_greene_county_coxsackie.htm">defining</a> and developing his property known as the "Coeymens Patent." His associate or partner in this was Ariaantie's husband, <a href="../vp/davplanck.html">David Verplanck</a>. 

<p>In September 1749, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22cuyman&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22cuyman&f=false">granted custody</a> of the creek behind his lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> by the Albany city council. 

<p>Samuel Coeymans made out a <a href="../../wills/willsacoeymans.html">will</a> in June 1754. Stating that he was a resident of Rensselaerswyck, it left his personal estate to his wife and real properties to the industry of his nephews - the Ten Eycks.  Samuel died in July 1754 and was buried from his church. His widow survived into the 1770s.</p>
