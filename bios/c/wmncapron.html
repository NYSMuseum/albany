<strong>William N. Capron</strong></a> was born during the late 1780s. He was the son of <a href="wmcapron7544.html">William Capron</a> (the younger) and Mary Northen Capron.

<p>In 1814, William N. Capron <a href="http://www.dodgefamily.org/VitalRecords/NewYork/greaterNYcity_marriages.shtml">married</a> Clarissa Dodge of New York City.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA59,M1">1813</a>, he was called a merchant at 40 <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a>. Beginning in 1815, the home and business of William N. Capron began to appear in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a>. Variously called a merchant and painter, his addresses were given as 30 Sand and 49 Washington Streets. As late as 1830, his was one of six Capron-named addresses in the booming city.


<p>William N. Capron died in June 1835. He had lived 47 years. His widow, Clarissa, lived until 1846. Both deaths were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=caMpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+capron&source=web&ots=AcG03GewtR&sig=J9sfco_adWJy4J77N-to3Zoln6s&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result">noted</a> in the Albany newspapers.
