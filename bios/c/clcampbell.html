<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Chloe Campbell</strong></a> is the married name for the wife then widow of Albany resident the <a href="jocampbell7536.html">John Campbell</a> who died before 1800. We seek defining information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> (starting with maiden name) and path to Albany. Subsequent resources have <a href="../../census1800.html#clca">fixed</a> her birth as between 1756 and 1774.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#clca">1800</a>, "Clowe Campbell" was identified as the head of a first ward household. At that time, her family included two aadolescent/young adult males, three girls, and a women born between 1756 and 1774. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, her house, lot, and personal property were valued moderately on the first ward assessment roll.

<P>We believe that she was the "wife Chloe" and two daughters who were noted at the <a hef="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> of John Campbell's will in January 1802.</p>

<p>In 1796, "Mrs. Campbell" was identified as a member of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.
 
 <p>In September 1800, a "Widow Campbell" was <a href="../../res/realestate.html">identified</a> at the owner of a lot south of the lot owned by <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Mary <a href="../p/joprice1961.html">Price</a>. In August 1812, "Chloe" Campbell" purchased property on <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">Washington Avenue</a> from three individuals.
 
 <p>A <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#bottom">street diagram</a> set in the early 1800s shows the residence of "Mrs. Chloe Campbell" on the west side of what became South Pearl Street just south of the property of Mary Price.
 
<p>After those transactions, the name of "Chloe Campbell" has not been encountered in the community-based record. However, in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=P5A9&dq=%22campbell%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22campbell%22&f=false">1813</a>, seven Campbell-named addresses were listed in the first city directory.
