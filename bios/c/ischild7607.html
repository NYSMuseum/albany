<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isachar Child</strong></a> lived <a href="../../criteria.html">in</a> Albany during the 1770s. According to family-based <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DI5KaTC0_nkC&pg=PA732&lpg=PA732&dq=%22issachar+child%22&source=bl&ots=swOX1O2sek&sig=GeQEUxuzoCJxf-Lnlzl8hScYaDI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1wYUUNCwLOfo0QHCuYGwCA&ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22issachar%20child%22&f=false">resources</a>, he was born in 1749 and was of the Roxbury, Massachusetts branch of the Child(s) family. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>For December 1761, his name <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tR8WAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA255&lpg=PA255&dq=%22isachar+child%22&source=bl&ots=ll_RN2T_DM&sig=iV9FpszXWOcDi3byRHROtinT1K4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZfATUKrrB4Lb6wGY6oCQDg&ved=0CDMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22isachar%20child%22&f=false">appeared</a> on the muster roll of General Lyman's Connecticut troops.

<p>Perhaps he <a href="http://genealogy.clanmoffat.org/getperson.php?personID=I22800&tree=ClanMoffat">married</a> Alethea Moffet (b. 1742) of Windham County, Connecticut in November 1766. Their first four sons were born in Connecticut between 1767 and 1772. A fifth son was christened in Schenectady in 1774. A daughter named for her mother was christened in Albany in June 1776 and died a few days later.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1775">1775</a>, he was named constable for the second ward. Two weeks <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=%22isacher+child%22&source=bl&ots=wxhFbYw8ew&sig=hMEeOhj35oNMYsJ4w46DdHGI018&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZfATUKrrB4Lb6wGY6oCQDg&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22isacher%20child%22&f=false">later</a>, the council inexplicably recinded the appointment and ordered that he be replaced. 

<p>In November 1776, the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> charged him to carry <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/ABP1949.0001.001/633?rgn=full+text;view=image">letters</a> to the new counties in northern New York. A month later, his <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/ABP1949.0001.001/671?rgn=full+text;view=image">account</a> of &pound15.16 for expenses was ordered to be paid. 

<p>In August 1777, his pasture was among the properties the Committee <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/abp1949.0001.001/854?page=root;rgn=full+text;size=100;view=image">ordered</a> to be appraised.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7607">1779</a>, "Childs house" in the first ward was valued on an Albany assessment roll.

<p>In October <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OGx2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA545&lpg=PA545&dq=%22isacher+childs%22&source=bl&ots=8PNWxr1Jfy&sig=kWzRYLoGMvS_GbW8n0nIO5pdVMc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jAoUUNLrEc7G0AHU2YDQCA&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22isacher%20childs%22&f=false">1780</a>, "Isacher Childs" was examined by the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> regarding the passing of counterfeit money.

<p>After that, his name appears to have dropped from the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based record</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of "Isackob Childs" was counted on the <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/RUDD/1998-05/0896374266">census</a> of the ninth ward in New York City. At that time, the unit housed a man, a boy, and one female. In <a href="http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Directory/1791NY/c.html">1791</a>, the New York City directory listed him at 1 Murray Street but with no occupation.
<p>In October <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Yx4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA358&lpg=PA358&dq=%22isachar+child%22&source=bl&ots=97i3Ri6COp&sig=5PDW9fwJn8UCrMvofpJtYcIJqGU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZfATUKrrB4Lb6wGY6oCQDg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22isachar%20child%22&f=false">1794</a>, letters of administration were granted to his son Evander. At that time, the elder Child was identified as of New York City.
<p>However, Isachar Child is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DI5KaTC0_nkC&pg=PA732&lpg=PA732&dq=%22issachar+child%22&source=bl&ots=swOX1O2sek&sig=GeQEUxuzoCJxf-Lnlzl8hScYaDI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1wYUUNCwLOfo0QHCuYGwCA&ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22issachar%20child%22&f=false">said</a> to have died in July 1797.

<p>At this point, we feel that we have only scratched the surface regarding the life of this one-time Albany resident. With so many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> still outstanding, we move on for now!</p>
