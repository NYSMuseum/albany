<P><a href="#sources"><b>Joseph Caldwell</b></a> was born in Northern Ireland about 1737. He probably was the older brother of <a href="jacaldwell7509.html">James Caldwell</a>. By the early 1770s, the Caldwells were in Albany and advertizing their grocery items in the newly published <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. At that time, their grocery was located in the house of John Visscher on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>.</p>

<p>His wife was named Rebecca. They married prior to his arrival in Albany. She was the mother of a number of children.

      <p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>, he 
        lent financial support to the crusade for American liberties. In January 
        1778, he petitioned to be excused from military duty because he was "the 
        schoolmaster." At that time, two assistants were teaching with him. Caldwell 
        supplemented a teacher's income by continuing to sell groceries - even 
        petitioning the city council for permission to build on to the <a href="../../loc/markethouse.html">Market 
        House</a> in 1786.</p>

<p>In 1779 and for a decade after, his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7510">modest home</a> was located in the second ward. Over the next 
        decades, he relocated several times within the Albany area. In 1790, the 
        <a href="../../census1790.html#7510">census</a> showed he was living in 
        <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> near the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor 
        House</a>. In 1799, he was living on Maiden Lane but in business in Watervliet 
        with Isaac Mark. The census for <a href="../../census1800.html#7510">1800</a> enumerated his house in the second ward. In 1802, Caldwell purchased a lot on <a href="../../streets.html#steuben">Steuben 
        street</a> and took up more permanent residence there. His name appeared 
        in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city diretories</a> as a 
        teacher at 25 Steuben Street. In 1822, his residence was at 4 North Pearl 
        Street.</p>


<p>Like his brother, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a>. Later, he was a founder and officer of the <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">United Presbyterian Church</a>.

 

<p>Joseph Caldwell lost his wife, Rebecca, in 1808. He died in June 1822 at age eighty-five. He was called "a respectable citizen."</p>
