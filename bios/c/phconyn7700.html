<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Leendertse</strong></a> was born about 1660. He was the son of New Netherland emigres and Albany residents <a href="leconyn3769.html">Leendert</a> and Agnietie Caspers Conyn (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Conine</a>). He grew up in an Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#3769">home</a> with a number of siblings who would raise families of their own in Albany and its environs. His father died in New York in 1704 but his mother lived on in Albany for some time afterwards. 

<p>Philip's wife was Wyntie Dircks (Van Vechten). They married about 1682. By 1701, the marriage had produced at least eight children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and he was a prominent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1699pmc">supporter</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#7700">1699</a>, he was among those Albany and area residents who signed a loyalty oath to the king of England.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7700">1709</a>, his name was included with a group of people at the end of the city assessment roll.

<p>After that, he seems to have left Albany. Soon afterwards, a "Philip Conyn, Jr." was noted in the regional record - sometimes in addition to simply "Philip Conyn" or "Philip Leendertse Conyn."

<p>Philip Conyn was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/beers_history_of_greene_county_coxsackie.htm">living</a> in Coxsackie in 1720. The following year, he (as well as Philip Jr.) witnessed the signing of the <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/albany/wills/v1a/conyn-casperl.txt">will</a> of his brother.

<p>Philip Leendertse Conyn probably died sometime thereafter.</p>
