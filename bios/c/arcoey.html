      <P><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/arcoeymans.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=170 alt="wedding portrait of Ariaantie Coeymans"></a><a href="#sources"> 
        <strong>Ariaantie Coeymans</strong></a> was born in October 1672. She 
        was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers 
        <a href="bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieterse</a> and <a href="../d/geerdvos.html">Geertruy 
        De Vos</a> Coeymans. She probably grew up on her father's farm <a href="../../census1697.html#6155">south</a> 
        of Albany. By 1712, Barent Pieterse was dead leaving his children to share 
        his sizable estate which included property in and around Albany. 
      <p>Tradition holds that Ariaantie lived with her brother <a href="sacoeymans.html">Samuel</a> in a house the family had built on the stream that flowed into the Hudson at today's village of Coeymans. That landmark building is still standing and has been <a href="http://www.coeymanshistory.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=95:ariaantje-coeymans-enigmatic-colonial-dutch-woman&catid=1:latest-news">mem</a>orialized in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&sugexp=ldymls&xhr=t&q=coeymans+house&cp=12&qe=Y29leW1hbnMgaG91&qesig=XRRb97rhJZQbS38YrCdEVw&pkc=AFgZ2tkkRIBbOF1ts-ud3LtZGYu3bJ6TsMoajgGD6o_2G-8pa1mTltOWMu1ysVOqYNoRy86jExL-KvcbiKGWhCzDacIlj4uSHQ&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&wrapid=tljp1303823015568020&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&biw=1298&bih=725">painting</a> and <a href="http://www.historicmapworks.com/Buildings/index.php?state=NY&city=Coeymans">photography</a>.

      <p>In July 1723, Ariaantie was in her early fifties married a much younger <a href="../vp/davplanck.html">David 
        Verplanck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        The marriage produced no children. About that time, she was the subject 
        of the now famous <a href="#port">portrait</a> shown on the right. 
      <p>Samuel Coeymans married in 1724 and seems to have lived in the "Coeymans House" along with Ariaantie and her husband who also seems to have been Samuel's business partner. <a href="../qqqq.html">Perhaps</a>, other siblings also lived on the property as well. The Bleecker <a href="../../im/im1767.html">map</a> of 1767, fixes the homes of "Saml. Coiemans & Verplanks."


<p>Possibly because of her <a href="../../victorian.html">material</a> legacies, Ariaantie Coeymans Verplanck has become a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5Yk-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA794&lpg=PA794&dq=%22david+verplank%22&source=bl&ots=DFSI9BMzp6&sig=aRChJ5cvwu1Xp-sPjJlgCir330c&hl=en&ei=wwS3TYqAJI2RgQemvoxj&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CFkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22david%20verplank%22&f=false">legendary</a> historical character. She was not a resident of the city of Albany. She seems to have resided mostly in the "Coeymans House." 

      <p>However, <a href="../../res/sp.html">Ar</a>iaantie lived for more than seventy 
        years and died in April 1743. Her husband remarried, became somewhat more 
        closely connected to the life of the city of Albany, and survived until 
        the 1760s.</p>
