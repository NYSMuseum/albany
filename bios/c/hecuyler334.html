<strong>Hendrick C. Cuyler</strong></a> was born in August 1735. He was the second son in the large family of Albany mainstays <a href="cocuyler388.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../s/caschuyler1244.html">Catharina Schuyler</a> Cuyler. His father was a trader and community leader who served as mayor of Albany from 1742 to 1746. His mother also was the child of an Albany mayor. He grew up in a large family in a prominent merchant's <a href="../../census1756.html#141">home</a> on Pearl Street. Later, he would be known as "Henry C. Cuyler." He was the older brother of <a href="abccuyler359.html">Abraham C. Cuyler</a> - the last mayor of Albany under the British. His ailing mother died early in 1758. His father passed in 1765 after <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">leaving</a> Henry a substantial bequest.

<p>Our work on this individual is complicated by the fact that a number of Henry Cuylers emerged in New York, Albany, and on the frontier during the 1750s. This particular character may have been the "Hendrick Cuyler" who served as "commissary of stores" during the French and Indian <a href="../../7yw.html">War</a>. During the early 1760s, he still was in British service and was stationed in Martinique.

 After the war, he followed his father in business and as the owner of regional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lands</a>. His Hudson River sloop was a prominent part of the carrying trade. In <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">1765</a>, he was named to administer his deceased father's estate.

<p>In November 1767, he married <a href="../l/calydius4621.html">Catharina Lydius</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. The marriage produced children but they have not been located in extant baptism records of early Albany churches. By that time, he was a <a href="../../coerec1771.html#334">member</a> at St. Peter's.

<p>During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his name appeared on Abany assessment rolls. By that time, these Cuylers had made their <a href="../../im/im1767.html">home</a> across the river on family property at Greenbush. He also was able to acquire title to several tracts of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a>  beyond Albany as a result of his wartime service.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, this successful merchant, shipper, and landholder was identified as a British sympathizer. Before long, he was apprehended and confined by his kin and neighbors - now the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">revolutionaries</a>. In 1778, he refused to sign an oath of allegience to New York State and was denounced as disloyal. He seems to have been sent to prisons and placed on paroles in Kingston and in Boston. However, this passive loyalist was spared the <a href="../../tmln/tory.html">consequences</a> that befell his younger brother, royalist mayor Abraham C. Cuyler.

<p>After the war, he was just fifty but does not appear to have attempted to re-establish himself in public life. Living in Greenbush, he did seek to solidify his family's titles to investment real estate across upstate New York.  

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his country home was configured on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck census and included four slaves and six family members. His Greenbush neighbor was former Albany mayor <a href="../d/vopdouw2234.html">Volkert P. Douw</a>. In 1792, he was elected one of the directors of the Bank of Albany.
<p>Hendrick C. Cuyler died in February 1803 at the age of sixty-seven. His widow survived until 1818.</p>
