<P>Accoding to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Luycas Pieterse</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Lucas Coeymans) may have been <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Lucas-Coeymans/6000000009412668298">born</a> in Utrecht in 1628. He was the son of New Netherland pioneer Pieter Barentse. Prior to 1650 (perhaps as early as 1639), family members had emigrated to America, settled for the most part in what became <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, and today are known by the surname "<a href="../../res/sp.html">C</a>oeymans." This individual appears to have been the brother of <a href="bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieterse</a> Coeymans.

<p>By 1650, <a href="../../res/sp.html">Lu</a>cas (the brother of the aforementioned Barent Pieterse) was living in the upper Hudson and was implicated in a shooting incident before the Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../guide/histres.html#court">court</a>. He also came before the court on several occasions for debt, assault, and other abuses and infractions.

<p>During the early 1670s, he was part owner of a mill on the Poestenkil.

<p>His wife was named Ariaantie. At least during the late seventeenth century, they were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#6159">1683</a>, he was among those pledging contributing to the salary of a second minister. At that time he was among those living "outside the north gate" and "up the river."

<p>Perhaps he was among the four men counted under Barent Pieterse's Rensselaerswyck household in <a href="../../census1697.html#6155">1697</a>.

<p>After that, the name of Luycas Pieterse Coeymans has not yet been encountered in our sweep of the community-based record. Without a definitive connection to the city of Albany and with so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on for now.</p>
