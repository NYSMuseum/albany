<strong>Obadiah Cooper</strong></a> was born in October 1744. He was the son of <a href="thcooper509.html">Thomas Cooper</a> and his first wife, Elizabeth Van Buren Cooper. His mother died before Obadiah's fourth birthday and he was raised mostly by his stepmother in a tailor's family home on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany.

<p>In May 1769, he married seventeen-year-old <a href="../vd/anvdb5727.html">Anna Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1791, seven daughters had been christened in the church where he was a member and pewholder.

<p>His adult life began in the home of his father where his personal property was valued on the assessment of <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#498">1788</a>. By <a href="../../census1790.html#498">1790</a>, he had taken over as head of that <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household which <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gNMHe7WmqPoC&pg=PA733&lpg=PA733&dq=%22obadiah+cooper%22+albany&source=web&ots=C6R6ZMLmKB&sig=YChoD56zDS27rTCKj_cCqqrA7i4">appeared</a> to be located on or near the corner of Hudson and what became South Pearl Street. 

<p>This Obadiah Cooper was a merchant who sold tobacco from his store on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> as early as 1772. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, he was named one of the city watchmen. Beginning in 1779. his holdings were valued substantially on city assessment rolls. Later, he was identified as an innkeeper.

<p>In January 1766, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willluyates.html">will</a> of a neighbor. In 1767, he was identified as a corporal in a first ward, Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. In April 1771, he was among the prominent Albany men appointed to serve as watchmen by the city council.

<p>This Obadiah Cooper was an emerging Albany mainliner and in his forties during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war years</a>. Thus, he would have been expected  to have played some role in the conflict. One time, his accounts were paid by the 
Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> and, in 1781, his house was referenced in a letter. Later he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#498">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>Obadiah Cooper lost his wife when "Hannah" died in 1801. Until  at least 1815, he lived on in a home at 150 South Pearl Street  - an address he shared with a married daughter. He <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~nobleone/tawn/Families/cooper_family.htm#2.%20Obadiah2%20Cooper">died</a> in Albany in February 1826 at the age of eighty-one.
