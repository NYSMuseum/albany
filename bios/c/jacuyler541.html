<!-- Start Main Content -->
      <P>Known as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob A. Cuyler</strong></a>, he was born 
        in March 1765. Jacob A. was the second son of Albany mainstays <a href="abhcuyler363.html">Abraham 
        H.</a> and <a href="../w/cawendell2779.html">Catharine Wendell</a> 
        Cuyler. He grew up in a businessman's <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a> home. 
      <p>In 1786, he is said to have married <a href="../k/rekane.html">Rebecca Kane</a> in Schoharie. By 1804, seven children had been christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany where both parents were members and pewholders.

<p>In 1787, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=icI1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA140&lpg">appointed</a> lieutenant in a light infantry company of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#541">1788</a>, his personal property was noted under the household of his father. In <a href="../../census1790.html#541">1790</a>, Jacob A. Cuyler's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> household was configured on the Albany census.

<p>In March 1788 and in September 1791, he was identified as  a fireman in the city records.

<p>In January <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#541">1808</a>, "Jacob A. Cuyler" was invited to the funeral of Henry J. Bleecker. 

<p>We hesitate in assigning additional defining information as several Jacob A. Cuyler's seem to have been living in the Albany area during this time.
