<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Campbell</strong></a> was living in Albany in <a href="../../census1800.html#7535">1800</a> when his household was enumerated on the census for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. At that time, two boys, and two girls were living with an adult couple. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the city census accounted for four boys, three young females, a couple who had aged since 1800, and two other free people. We will call him "the younger" as at least two same-named contemporaries were living <a href="jocampbell7536.html">in</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html#272">around</a> Albany at that time.

<p>Based on the resources shown above, this individual was born between 1766 and 1775. However, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. We surmise that he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Margaret Grant at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church in March 1787. At that time, both partners were identified as "of Albany." The union appears to have produced a number of children.

<p>Qualitative information for several John Campbells is avaliable for the next decades. However, the life of John Campbell "the younger" probably had ended by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22widow+margaret%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22widow%20margaret%22&f=false">1813</a> when widow Margaret Campbell was listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 54 State Street.</p>
