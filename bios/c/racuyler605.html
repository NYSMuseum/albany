<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Rachel Cuyler</B></A> was born in New York in 1674. She was the daughter of New Netherland pioneers Hendrick Cuyler and his wife Anna Schempoes.</P>

          <P>Rachel married Albany native <a href="../s/mynschuyler101.html">Myndert 
            D. Schuyler</a> in 1693. By that time, her family had re-located to 
            <a href="#albany">Albany</a>. Their <a href="../s/anschuyler932.html">only 
            child</a> was baptized in 1697 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> where both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.</P>

          <p>As the wife of a prominent Albany <a  href="../s/mynschuyler101.html">personage</a>, 
            Rachel Schuyler presided over their State Street home - particularly 
            during the times when her husband was in New York or attending to 
            his numerous holdings.</P>

          <p>By the 1730s, Rachel had become ill and was "bedridden" for many years. Nevertheless, 
            <a href="../../wills/willmynschuyler101.html">in 1739</a>, she was named 
            co-executor and a principal beneficiary of her husband's estate. However, 
            she died in 1747 at age seventy-three. She was buried from the Albany 
            Dutch church.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Rachel Cuyler Schuyler</B> is 
            CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 605. This profile is derived chiefly 
            from family and community-based resources. A family bible record of 
            her death states she was "bedridden 9 years." The principal published 
            resource on her family is still Maud C. Nicoll, <i>The Earliest Cuylers 
            in Holland and America</i> (New York, 1912), p. 18. </P>

<p><a name=albany></a>By the late 1670s, her parents already had <b>removed to Albany</b> where they established the Cuyler family in the upper Hudson region.</p>
