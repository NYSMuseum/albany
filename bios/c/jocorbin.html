<P> <a href="#sources"><strong>John Corbin</strong></a> is said to have been born in 1729, the first child of the marriage of John and Margaret Hosmer Corbin. The existence of several same-named contemporaries and variable <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>ellings of the surname requires <a href="../qqqq.html">caution</a> in the assignment of qualitative information. This profile concerns the Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">resident</a> during the second half of the eighteenth century. That individual was born in Killingly, Connecticut and was of New England ancestry.

<p>He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ghcfAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA582&lpg=PA582&dq=%22john+corbin%22+albany&source=bl&ots=OjskxdVk6X&sig=Zjq7xnCeKVlUrf_cvPJxwcfn2xA&hl=en&ei=GRqiTMCGE8H-8AaC5PTkBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&sqi=2&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22john%20corbin%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have married a somewhat younger Abigail Cabot in Killingly (now Thompson) in February 1761. The marriage produced at least three children.

<p>Corbin re-located to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> and then to Albany. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside Albany house and property were valued moderately. In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">1779</a>, his holdings were not included on the city assessment roll. However, a subsequent tax list from October of that year valued his holdings and his "hired house." 

<p>He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have "engaged in trade and to have owned a sloop which he sailed up and down the Hudson River." However, he does <a href="../../sources.html#jp">not</a> seem to have encountered Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> who employed most of the Albany-based river carriers during the 1760s and early '70s.

<p>In 1775, he joined a number of residents of the first ward in subscribing for the relief of Ticonderoga. In February 1777, he submitted an account to the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> regarding the raising of a militia company two years earlier.  

<p>He is said to have been a captain in the Revolutionary army under General Gates. However, such claims appear to be <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=heitman+officers&printsec=frontcover&source#">unsubstantiated</a>.

<p>He also is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have invested in Continental currency and to have lost his fortune.

<p>The accounts of the debts due the <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#joco">estate</a> of Dr. Henry Van Dyck made in 1788 included Corbin's small obligation.

<p>However, by that time, John Corbin had removed to the northern Champlain Valley where died in February 1803. His daughter married <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Nf7RY6pEojkC&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22john+corbin%22+kinderhook&source=bl&ots=xfJ0vu-Qyp&sig=tmru9x7hSgUS5dAcNvk-OI4v6wg&hl=en&ei=JkWjTNTHGoGBlAfd6cjKBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20corbin%22%20kinderhook&f=false">Pliny Moore</a>, the pioneer settler of Champlain. </p>
