      <P><A href="#sources"><B>Nicholas Clement</B></A> was born in 1750. He was 
        the only surviving child of the marriage of Indian interpreter <a href="../c/jaclement7648.html">Jacobus 
        Clement</a> and <a href="../vw/janvwoert2606.html">Jannetje Van Woert</a>. By 1767, his father had passed on and his mother had taken 
        over as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">owner</a> of their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> household.</P>
<P>In 1767, he was identified as a fifer in <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham Cuyler</a>'s company of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>.
      <p>He probably lived with his widowed mother in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> until he married Albany area native Rachel <a href="../d/degarmo.html">De 
        Garmo</a>. The couple <a href="#left">left the Albany area</a> sometime 
        after the birth of their daughter in 1777. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2606">1790</a>, no men were living 
        in his mother's Southside home. 
      <p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his further exploits and passing. His wife was buried in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1823.</P>

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Nicholas Clement 
        is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 7651. This brief profile 
        is derived chiefly from family and community-based resources. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> 
        is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Like a number 
        of early Albany boys, he seems to have vanished. Not so! With your help, 
        we will find out what happened to him.
