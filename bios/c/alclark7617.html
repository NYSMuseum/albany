<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Alexander Clark</strong></a> appears to have been born during the 1720s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, path to Albany, and possible connection to Albany contemporary <a href="pclark7635.html">Patrick Clark</a>. Perhaps <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=%22alexander+clark%22+albany&sig=FPah92Lq7foYAgqF17aYdiv2R2s&ei=4HdMUfc1xbvgA6WDgaAI&id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&ots=GuN92q0LJB&output=text">he</a> was a native of <a href="../irish.html">Scotland</a>.

<p>His wife was a somewhat younger <a href="../g/nangrant.html">Nancy (or Ann) Grant</a>. In 1779 and 1781, the parents christened two children at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Between 1786 and 1789, three children were christened by them at the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. At that time, Alexander was identified as a carpenter and as a laborer.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7617">1779</a> and  <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7617">1788</a>, his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> were valued on the city assessment rolls.

<p>In April 1787, his account was paid from the city treasury.

<p>In April 1788, his leased <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA312&lpg=PA312&dq=%22alexander+clark%20&source=bl&ots=0TojxpNnvv&sig=XzgA4e_9lUqX43KoZsv4stUVAU0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fHVMUc03xcjgA4iFgOgN&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22alexander%20clark%22&f=false">lot</a> in the second ward (20'x 30' and bounded on the east by Duke Street) was referenced. At the end of May, his house was noted as being next to where Alexander Mc Gilvory petitioned to build. 

<p>However, in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the only Alexander Clarks to appear on the census in New York State were residents of New York City and Washington County. 

<p>Alexander Clark died in April 1795 at the age of sixty-five. He was buried in the United <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">Pres</a>byterian Church <a href="../../dead.html">plot</a> in the cemetery in Albany.

<p>In August of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=%22alexander+clark%22+albany&sig=FPah92Lq7foYAgqF17aYdiv2R2s&ei=4HdMUfc1xbvgA6WDgaAI&id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&ots=GuN92q0LJB&output=text">1830</a>, the Albany paper reported that "Ann, widow of Alexander Clark, died, aged 78. She was a native of Scotland, but had resided in Albany more than half a century."</p>
