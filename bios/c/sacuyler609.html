<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Sara Cuyler</B></A> was born during the mid-1660s, the eldest daughter of <a href="hecuyler533.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../s/anschepmoes8629.html">Anna Schepmoes</a> Cuyler of New Amsterdam/Beverwyck. About that time, her parents had relocated to Albany where they established the <a href="cuyler.html">Cuyler family</a> in the upper Hudson region.</P>

<P>Growing up in the business environment of both New York and Albany, her father's 
            numerous contacts among the colony's commercial elite brought home 
            a number of potential suitors. In November 1688, Sara married aspiring 
            trader <a  href="../vb/pvbrugh.html">Pieter Van Brugh</a> at the New 
            York Dutch Reformed Church. Their only child was baptized there in 
            1689. By 1692, Sara had brought her husband and daughter to the Cuylers' 
            Albany house where Pieter entered the family business.</P>

<p>Aided by family connections, Pieter Van Brugh prospered in the Albany setting. Although without a large family of her own, Sara helped raise her younger siblings in the Cuyler house on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> while her widowed mother tended to their Manhattan <a href="#business">business</a>. By 1697, Pieter and Sara Van Brugh's home was an <a href="../../census1697.html#006">Albany landmark</a>.</p>

          <p>In 1707, the Van Brugh household grew when Pieter was appointed guardian of 
            the orphaned daughters of his sister and John Donaldson - a recently 
            deceased soldier. After that, Sara had more than enough family with 
            the twelve children born to her daughter, <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8628.html">Catharina 
            Livingston</a>, living next door. Like her husband, Sara Van Brugh 
            was an active member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
            and a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>With the death of her husband in 1740, Sara inherited his large estate.  However, Sara Cuyler Van Brugh died less than two years later. In May 1742, she was buried with her husband beneath the Albany church. With no sons, the Van Brugh family name passed from Albany rolls.</p>
