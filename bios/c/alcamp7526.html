<P>A number of individuals named <a href="#sources"> <strong>Alexander Campbell</strong></a> were living in New York during the second half of the eighteenth century. The subject of this profile married <a href="../m/mamcm.html">Mary Mc Millan</a> in 1778 and lived in Albany into the 1790s. A prominent, same-named <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=aZz213hdj3EC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22alexander+campbell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=JCA7IEcq_N&sig=DQHi0SNQ5-q1ZfXX2LfhuG4oiGw&hl=en&ei=rJQgTY_FBIP68AaPq6W6DA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&q=%22alexander%20campbell%22%20albany&f=false">contemporary</a> was a one-time resident of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady and a loyalist exile.

<p>This individual probably came to Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. In June 1777, he was among those issued instructions by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>. Afterwards, "Alexander Camplee" was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7526">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In July 1778, he married Mary Mc Mullen at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1781, two children were christened there. Between 1787 and 1791, three more children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church where both parents appear to have been members. Presbyterian records identified him as a "laborer." However, a number of marriage senarios are <a href="../qqqq.html">possible</a> for this Albany resident.

<p>In January 1787, he was paid from the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> treasury. In August 1781, he was granted a lot adjacent to that of <a href="../g/grgrant8223.html">Gregor Grant</a>. In March 1792, he was granted a lot on the south side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7526">1788</a>, his personal property was assessed within the home of a newcomer <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a> in a location along the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a> above the core city. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7526">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>After 1790, his name is absent from Albany rolls. However, an Alexander Campbell's name appeared on a <a href="http://www.albanyhilltowns.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Landmarks_of_Albany_County_first_tenants_of_Rensselaerville">map</a> showing the first tenants in   Rensselaerville dated 1787. In 1797 and 1800, he was <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">leasing</a> a farm in Rensselaerville. In November 1803, he was deeded twenty-three acres in  <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> by <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer</a>. Perhaps, he was formerly of Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#alcam">1800</a>, an age appropriate Alexander Campbell was identified on the census as a householder (with six children 10 and under) in the section of Watervliet just <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> of Albany.

<p>With so many <a href="../qqqq.html">loose</a> ends, enough for now. We seek defining information on the <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and passing of the Albany resident Alexander Campbell.</p>
