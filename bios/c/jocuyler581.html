<strong>Johannes Cuyler</strong></a> was born in February 1699. He was the son of Albany leaders <a href="jocuyler546.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../t/elstbroeck42.html">Elsie Ten Broeck</a>  Cuyler. Sometimes, he was referred to as "Johannes J. Cuyler" or as "Johannes Cuyler, Jr." His father was a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany in 1725. In 1736, he was left a bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willjocuyler546.html">will</a> filed by his father.


<p>During the 1720s, he married <a href="../g/caglen4919.html">Catherine Glen</a>. By 1741, the marriage had produced at least four children. He was a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over four decades, he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>Johannes J. Cuyler was a merchant who lived near other family members in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1738">1738</a>, he was elected alderman. He served two more terms on the city council. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#581">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of qualified voters.

<p>He owned additional parcels of real property within the city limits.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#144">1756</a>, perhaps he was the merchant "Mr. J. Cuyler" listed on the census of householders as the partner of "Mr. Gill." 


<p>Johannes J. Cuyler lived into the 1760s. He witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoglen4933.html">will</a> of his dead wife's brother in September 1767. At that time, four of their children were living.</p>
