<strong>Timothy Cooper</strong></a> was born in April 1644. He <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ma/county/hampden/gene/bios2_spfld.html">is said</a> to have been the  son of Thomas and Sarah Cooper of Springfield, Massachusetts.


<p>In October 1664, he married Elizabeth Munson. By 1672, the marriage had produced four children.

<p>During the 1670s, he re-located to Albany and entered the <a href="../../../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. His business partners or associates included his father, Springfield developer John Pynchon, and another Albany newcomer named <a href="../l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a>.

<p>In 1675, he was admitted as a "burgher" in Albany. He served on a number of Albany juries.  He purchased and sold several properties within the Albany stockade. In <a href="../../census1679.html#514">1679</a>, his name was included on a census of Albany householders. His residence was on <i>Johnker</i> (<a href="../../streets.html#state">State</a>) Street. 

<p>In November 1679, the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court minutes</a> noted that Timothy Cooper had died in New Jersey and that his horse was roaming unsupervised in the Albany pasture. In 1680, his widow liquidated Cooper's real estate holdings.</p>
