<P>Based on subsequent events, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Andries Coeymans</strong></a> appears to have been <a href="../../res/guess.html">born</a> during the last quarter of the seventeenth century. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New N</a>etherland pioneers <a href="bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieters</a> and <a href="../d/geerdvos.html">Geertruy De Vos</a> Coeymans. He was named for his mother's <a href="../d/anddvos.html">father</a>.

<p>This individual had business with the city government in 1715 but probably was <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> a resident of Albany. This sketch organizes <a href="../../res/irs.html">available</a> information on a principal of the so-called <a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans Patent</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#6155">1697</a>, he was one of four men accounted for on the provincial <a href="../../census.html">census</a> under the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> household of his father. No adult women were listed in that household.

<p>In July 1704, he was one of those named <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZsP0BZGcDY0C&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=%22andries+coeymans%22+will&source=bl&ots=jk6zQkmHaB&sig=5lrBUpeS22y9i6ZVqJmS6Yu1eVc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Y_3eUofELcPTqgHajYCACw&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22andries%20coeymans%22%20will&f=false">guardian</a> of the estate of Andries Gardinier of <a href="../../na/khook.html">K</a>inderhook.

<p>Barent Pieterse was dead by October 1712 when <a href="#letters">letters of administration</a> on the Coeymans estate were granted to Andries Coeymans who was identified as his eldest son. 

      <p>In August 1714, Andries was granted <a href="../../res/realestate.html">title</a> 
        to the longtime family tract in southern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a> that would become known as the <a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans 
        Patent</a>. A few years later he was a partner in a <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/Colonial-New-York-Philip-Schuyler-and-His-Family-Volume-2-2/396642/441">patent</a> 
        for land in the Schoharie Valley. 
      <p>In January <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=%22mr+andris+coyman%22&source=bl&ots=xr7Ddju1_Z&sig=m2ryKUCbjDxuT-TsYmF_hmAjvSM&hl=en&ei=wnZNTdzhGoutgQeq3eVH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22mr%20andris%20coyman%22&f=false"">1715</a>, the Albany government notified him to stop surveying the lots granted to Andries De Vos (his grandfather) on the north side of Albany. A week later, city records <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=%22that+andries+coyman%22&source=bl&ots=xr7Ddju1_Z&sig=m2ryKUCbjDxuT-TsYmF_hmAjvSM&hl=en&ei=wnZNTdzhGoutgQeq3eVH&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22that%20andries%20coyman%22&f=false"">noted</a> that he had posted an advertisement on the <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> porch to sell the lots on the west side of the north end of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> and outside of the city gate.

<p>In June 1716, Andries <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/Colonial-New-York-Philip-Schuyler-and-His-Family-Volume-2-2/396642/441"">married</a> Geertruy <a href="../s/staats.html">Staats</a> the widow of Pieter Nagle in New York City. By 1727, the marriage had produced at least five children.

<p>In August <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rdcTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22andries+coeymans%22&source=bl&ots=2PkdXj7iW_&sig=icXRyRzSTANfbBCaZ1lBiES9UF4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7VPdUtDIEI3noATyzYLACg&ved=0CFMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22andries%20coeymans%22&f=false">1724</a>, Andries was chosen executor and heir and his living children were named as heirs in the will filed by his widowed and childless sister. 

<p>He owned a substantial house and property in New York. But, by the mid 1720s, he had removed his family to the comparative safety of Raritan, New Jersey. 

<p>Andries Coeymans filed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RLIFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345&dq=%22andries+coeymans%22+%22somerset+county%22&source=bl&ots=mijAtL0-KM&sig=ZiwHnw5cspcgGlrt_oMWUbVTZt4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=meDfUp-wIc7ioATUwoHACQ&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22andries%20coeymans%22%20%22somerset%20county%22&f=false">will</a> in July 1741. He identified himself as a "gentleman" and was living in Somerset County, New Jersey. His estate in New York and New Jersey was left to his wife as long as she remained a widow and then was divided among his son and three living daughters. The will passed probate in New Jersey in October.
  
<p>In 1754, the <a href="../../wills/willsacoeymans.html">will</a> of his childless brother provided for the late Andries's children but mentioned that Andries's debts to him still remained unpaid. </p>
