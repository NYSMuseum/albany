<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry Cook</strong></a> was in Albany during the early 1780s. Perhaps he was of New England <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XUpkAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=%22henry+cook%22+albany&source=bl&ots=dNXGPt97_g&sig=jtUtlhAmpbipJGlyxNMs3nxh4oA&hl=en&ei=UWp2TI-TL4P6lwe-o_nsCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20cook%22%20albany&f=false">ancestry</a>. A number of same-named individuals are at risk during his lifetime.

<p>No evidence of marriage or family has been found in the records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#cook">1779</a>, only a "Peter Cook" was listed on the Albany assessment roll which listed him as a boarder in a <a  href="../../wards.html">third ward</a> home.

<p>In March 1781, his ("Hendrick Cook") account for eight shillings was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?dq=%22collections+on+the+history+of+albany%22&printsec=frontcover&sig=YP4BhVLTpmUam-6sJc2hVWSoX68&ct=result&pg=PA322&id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&ots=wwgFcQx8ir#v=onepage&q&f=false">presented</a> to the city council for payment.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7701">1781</a>, he was among those non natives who purchased the "Freedom of Albany." At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/metal.html">blacksmith</a>.

<p>With the end of the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">War</a>, his <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7701">name</a> appeared on the roster of the Albany militia regiment as one of those qualified to receive a land bounty right. We seek information on his actual wartime service.

<p>After that, his name has not been found in the community-based <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a>.

<p>In 1790, the names of two householders named Henry Cook appeared on the census for Long Island.

<p>Henry Cook made but a fleeting impression on the community-based record. We seek information on his origins, later life, and passing. At this point, we are left with many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.</p>
