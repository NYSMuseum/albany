<P><A href="#biography"><B>Margarita Cuyler</B></A> was born in 1692. She was the eldest daughter of the ten children born to Albany trader <a href="../c/abcuyler358.html">Abraham Cuyler</a> and his wife, Albany native <a href="../b/cableecker153.html">Catharina Bleecker</a> Cuyler.</P>

          <P>In November 1714, she married trader <a href="../t/dtbroeck33.html">Dirck 
            Ten Broeck</a>. Between 1715 and 1738, she gave birth to twelve children 
            who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
            where both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.</P>

<p>These Ten Broecks lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> in a house near the northern wall of the Albany stockade. Well-born Dirck Ten Broeck rose to wealth and recognition culminating in his election to the provincial Assembly and appointment as mayor of Albany in 1746. His success supported the marriages of Margarita's children into the <a href="#children">best regional families</a>.</p>

<p>Still with young children, Margarita was left alone in January 1751 when Dirck Ten Broeck died at age sixty-four. She was <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">named</a> co-executor of his substantial estate and left use of his property during her lifetime.</p>

          <p>Also inheriting property from the Cuylers, Margarita carried on with some of 
            her late husband's <a href="#business">enterprises</a> until her son, 
            <a href="../t/abtbroeck6.html">Abraham</a>, came of age later in 
            the decade. In <a href="../../census1756.html#290">1756</a>, she was the 
            matriarch of a large Albany family. A decade later, she still was 
            taxed as an active business person.</p>

          <p>Now in her seventies, the widow Margarita Cuyler lived through the era of the 
            <a href="../../or/or.html">American Revolution</a> - enjoying the 
            company of her daughters who had returned to Albany as refugees.</p>  

<p>Past her eightieth birthday, Margarita Cuyler Ten Broeck died in May 1783 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
