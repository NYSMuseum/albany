<P>The Albany <a href="#sources"><b>Cuyler family</b></a> is descended from <a href="hecuyler533.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../s/anschepmoes8629.html">Anna Schepmoes</a> Cuyler who settled in New Amsterdam during the 1650s.</p>

<p>Establishing themselves in Albany by 1664, their sons and daughters had <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> children of the first settlers thus creating a permanent Cuyler presence in Albany and its environs. By <a href="../../census1697.html#121">1697</a>, brothers <a href="abcuyler358.html">Abraham</a>  and <a href="jocuyler546.html">Johannes</a> Cuyler were Albany insiders. In 1712, their <a href="evcuyler525.html">sister</a> married Dominie <a href="../vd/pevdriessen6692.html">Petrus Van Driessen</a>.</p>

<p>The third generation spread out in the upriver region but maintained its Albany focus. The Cuylers were outstanding civic <a href="../../cityfathers.html">leaders</a> throughout the community's first century. <a href="jocuyler546.html">Johannes</a>, his son, <a href="cocuyler388.html">Cornelis Cuyler</a>, and his son, <a href="abccuyler359.html">Abraham C. Cuyler</a> each served as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of colonial Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, three Cuyler-named households were listed on the Albany census. 


<p>Two decades later, the family's position was compromised somewhat by the Toryism of royalist mayor Abraham C. Cuyler and some of his kin. At the same time, other Cuylers were ardent revolutionaries. With the end of the war, several Cuyler branches left America in exile. Mayor Cuyler's family re-located to Canada. Others established themselves in Africa. <p>

 
<img src="../../images/jpg/ad1816cuyler.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 widh=300 alt="the Cuylers of 1816"> In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, six Cuyler-named households were listed on the city census. In 1816, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> listed five Cuyler households in the older parts of the <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#pop">booming</a> new city!  Albany's Cuyler Street is named for this prominent, pioneer family. Antiquarian and city historian 
<a href="../r/cureynolds.html">Cuyler Reynolds</a> was their descendant!

<p>The Cuyler family of early Albany has numerous descendants and has been used by <a href="http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=488">places</a> and organizations across the United States.</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The most comprehensive printed source on the family was 
        compiled by <a href="../../fhg.html#ec">Maud Churchill Nicoll</a>. Descendant 
        <a href="../r/cureynolds.html">Cuyler Reynolds</a> paid special attention 
        to his forebears. The Afrikaans language <i>Het Geslacht Kuilart</i> by J. W. Schaap and H. H. J. Kuilart (South Africa, 1984), includes many family portraits - but, because of language, remains otherwise indecipherable! Internet resources are numerous but still without distinction!
