<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Cuyler, Jr.</b></a> was born in December 1690. He was the first son born to Albany mainstays <a href="abcuyler358.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../b/cableecker153.html">Catharina Bleecker</a> Cuyler. He was baptized at the Dutch church in New York City.</p>


<p>Hendrick Jr. followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> - perhaps representing the <a href="cuyler.html">family</a> in the Indian country. He appeared on Albany rolls first in 1722 when he was elected assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 

<p>In December 1722, he was thirty-two when he married <a href="../vd/mgtvdu5548.html">Margarita Van Deusen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, pewholder, and occasional baptism sponsor. By 1733, six of their children had been christened in Albany.</p>

<p>Over the next decade, Hendrick Jr. settled down in Albany - <a href="../../wills/willabcuyler358.html">inheriting</a> his father's Pearl Street home and blosseming into a prominent <a href="../../census1756.html#146">merchant</a> and member of the Albany <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">business community</a>. In 1758, he was appointed justice of the Albany County court of common pleas. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#530">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.</p>

<p>Hendrick Cuyler, Jr. filed a <a href="../../wills/willhecuyler530.html">will</a> in March 1761. It named his wife, son , and three daughters as direct heirs. He was buried from his church in March 1765. The will passed probate two years later.</p>
