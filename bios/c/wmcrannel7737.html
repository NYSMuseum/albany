<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William W. Crannel</strong></a> was born in September 1749. He was the son of <a href="rocrannel7720.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../b/arbove.html">Ariaantie Bovie</a> Crannel. The eldest of six children, he grew up in the modest third ward home of an Albany barber and wigmaker. He was known as William W[inslow] <a href="../../res/sp.html">Cr</a>annel in honor of the family matriarch.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bZAbAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA809&lpg=PA809&dq=crannel&source=bl&ots=nD_8CAQkLq&sig=rWgPFWZb1ttzR0zbPQmsSRcp_Ds&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PqHxT6eOFqfX6wG4_8yeBg&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=crannel%20=false">1767</a>, "William Winslow Crannel" was listed as a soldier in a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> militia company.

<p>In January 1780, he married a slightly younger Mary <a href="../../res/sp.html">Eman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>He appears to have <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the Revolutionary army. His name appears several times on muster rolls of First New York Regiment. In October <a href="../../doc/bus/10181780.html">1780</a>, he was called "Capt." in the context of transporting people and supplies on his <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sloop</a> between Albany and West Point. Afterwards, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7737">land bounty</a> right in conunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7737">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for the part of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> located <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> of the city. However, the Albany assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> valued his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> modestly. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7737">1800</a> and afterwards, city censuses configured his household in the the same location.

<p>In March <a href="http://www30.us.archive.org/stream/proceedingsofrep00demo/proceedingsofrep00demo_djvu.txt">1810</a>, he was among a large group who attended "the first meeting" of Republicans at an Albany <a href="../../loc/public.html">public house</a>. 

<p>The first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22crannel+william%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22crannel%20william%22&f=false">1813</a> identified him as a barber living at 2 <a href="../../streets.html#dock">Dock</a> Street. The last directory listing for him in 1827 noted that William W. Crannel was 79-years-old, still identified as a barber, and was a resident of newly re-named Dean Street. 

<p>William W. Crannel died in December of 1828. He had lived eighty years. A year later, letters of administration were granted on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a>.</p>
