<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerritje Coeymans</strong></a> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on October 21, 1722. She was the daughter of southern Albany landholder Pieter Coeymans and his second wife Charlotte Drayer <a href="../../res/sp.html">Kojemans</a>. She grew up in a large combined <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA109&lpg=RA2-PA109#v=onepage&q&f=false">family</a> on the large estate generally known as the <a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans Patent</a>.

      <p>Gerritje was among the heirs of her father's large estate and is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=2pabvBmZXaIC&pg=PA261&lpg=PA261&dq=%22barclay,+gerritje+coeymans%22&source=bl&ots=FVUH3I9yYW&sig=7xSpF1W1uQM9F0jXSoC8tAHrV0Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwid8_7D8pzUAhVh2oMKHRHeDOwQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=%22barclay%2C%20gerritje%20coeymans%22&f=false">said 
        to have received</a> the land along the river on the site of today's New 
        Baltimore. 
      <p>By the 1740s, she had married Albany-born minister's son <a href="../b/jobarclay.html">John 
        Barclay</a>. No record of their marriage or children has been uncovered. 
        But the couple probably made their home on Coeymans family property where Barclay is said to have spent his young adulthood. 
		
      <p>Traditional sources tell us that Gerritje Coeymans died in September 1753 and 
        was buried "at her father's house." John Barclay remarried in 1771, took 
        up residence in Albany, and was appointed first mayor of Albany on the 
        first State Constitution of 1777. Neither Gerritje (although the inheritances 
        of his "first wife" were noted) nor any children were named in the <a href="../../wills/willjobarclay.html">will</a> 
        Barclay filed in 1779. He died shortly thereafter.</p>
