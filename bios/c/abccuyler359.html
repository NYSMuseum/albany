<P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/accuyler150.jpg" align=left  width=175 height=248 hspace=5 vspace=4 border=1 alt="Abraham C. Cuyler"></a><A  href="#biography"><B>Abraham C. Cuyler</B></A> was the last mayor of colonial Albany and a wealthy businessman. However, this native son lost everything as a result of his actions during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Am</a>erican Revolution.</P>

<p>He was born in Albany in 1742 - the fifth son of <a href="cocuyler388.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../s/caschuyler1244.html">Cathalina Schuyler</a> Cuyler. His father was a merchant, landholder, and mayor of Albany from 1742 to 1746. His mother was a <a href="../s/joschuyler100.html">daughter</a> of Albany's foremost <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland-era</a> family.</P>

<p>In April 1764, <a href="#this">this</a> Abraham Cuyler married his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> neighbor <a href="../g/jaglen4929.html">Jannetje (Janet) Glen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>. The first of their five children was born the following June. With the passing of his father in 1765, twenty-three-year-old Abraham assumed Cornelis Cuyler's place in Albany business and in the <a href="../../wills/willcocuyler.html">family home</a> above <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">North Pearl Street</a>. He also succeeded to his father's seat on the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">Common Council</a>. Prospering from importing metalware and from the patronage of <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a>, city assessment rolls for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and 1767 show him to be among the wealthiest of the young Albany merchants. Unlike other <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city fathers</a>, this younger son did not inherit extensive family lands. Thus, opportunity for future <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> acquisition was dependent on his connection to the royal government.

<p>In 1767, he was the captain of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company composed of his kin and city neighbors. 

<p>In September 1770, twenty-eight-year old Abraham C. Cuyler became the third member of his family to be appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany.  <a href="#sig"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/accuylersig.jpg" align=right width=230 height=50 hspace=3 vspace=4 border=1 alt="mayor's signature"></a> What soon would become a dubious honor was based on his standing within the Albany community and on his willingness to cooperate with the royal government 
            during a time of increasing tension between British and American interests. 
            His tenure at <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">city hall</a> paralleled 
            the <a href="../../lastdays.html">rapid development</a> of Albany 
            and its hinterland following the end of the last French and Indian 
            War in 1763.</p>

          
      <p>However, in 1775 Cuyler's administration was curtailed when escalating 
        conflict between colonists and king led to suspension of royal government 
        across New York. It ended in June 1776 when he was among those <a href="../../or/or-be.html">arrested</a> 
        by the Revolutionaries and exiled to Connecticut. Later transferred to 
        prison at Fishkill, he escaped to the British but made several trips to 
        Albany to visit his family. By 1778, his wife and children had joined 
        him in New York.</P>

<p>Abraham C. Cuyler suffered greatly from his attachment to the British government. Deprived of his property and condemned to death under the <a href="../../tmln/tory.html#attainder">Act of Attainder</a> in 1779, a destitute Cuyler sailed to England to seek relief.  Granted an annuity, he returned to New York.  After the peace treaty, he attempted to come home.  This American Tory soon learned there was no place for him in the new Albany.  Even though many of his kinsmen were prominent revolutionaries, he was unable to reclaim his Albany property.  Shunned by the new and old people of his birthplace, Abraham C. Cuyler took his family to upper Canada, founded the town of Yorkfield, and died there in 1810.</p>
