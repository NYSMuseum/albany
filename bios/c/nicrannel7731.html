<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Crannel</strong></a> was born in April 1760 and christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> church. He was the son of <a href="rocrannel7720.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../b/arbove.html">Ariaantie Bovie</a> Crannel. This youngest son grew up in the family of a barber/wigmaker in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. 

<p>At one time, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">id</a>entified as a sergeant in "Schuyler's" regiment. We seek more precise information on his wartime activities. Afterwards, he was granted a 
<a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7731">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. In <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=SUDw8-CC3DYC&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=%22nicholas+crannel%22&source=bl&ots=4OHDPONXvH&sig=rer_JIAvfbgjRb3oL2nTzL8WwhE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7WfwT_ibJejV0QGC1YD7Ag&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20crannel%22&f=false"">March 1790</a>, he was identified as a lieutenant in an Albany militia regiment. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SUDw8-CC3DYC&pg=PA453&lpg=PA453&dq=%22nicholas+crannell%22&source=bl&ots=4OHDPOOWwy&sig=KAofJnmV8F-iG_-npn02IOCaqjQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cmvwT9zGG6XX0QHHqoj7Ag&sqi=2&ved=0CFEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20crannell%22&f=false">1798</a>, he was promoted to "lieutenant of light infantry."

<p>In January 1793, he married Geertje <a href="../vd/vdb.html">Vandenbergh</a> at the <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Sch</a>aghticoke Dutch <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/sdrcm.htm">church</a>. Between 1793 and 1802, four children had been christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. His mother was buried from the Albany church in 1802 as well.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7731">1800</a>, his household of eleven people was configured on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census. Included under Nicholas 
Crannel were an older couple (perhaps his parents).

<p>Albany native Nicholas Crannell is <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/Nicholas_Crannell_records.ashx?pid=160072130">said</a> to have "passed away" in 1805. </p>
