<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent Pieterse Coeymans</strong></a> was born in Europe during the first part of the seventeenth century. He is said to have been from Utrecht.
 
<p>He came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> with his brothers (including <a href="lucoey6159.html">Luycas Pieterse</a>) and father in 1639. He was under contract to the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Van Rensselaers</a> to work as a miller and seems to have been in their employ into the 1650s. He is said to have been the brother-in-law of the director of Rensselaerswyck. In October 1674, he was among those <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#6155">invited</a> to a Van Rensselaer funeral. 

<p>His wife was <a href="../d/geerdvos.html">Geertruy De Vos</a>. Their children established the Coeymans family in greater Albany County. His <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">daughter</a> 
        married patriarch <a href="../t/jacote4807.html">Jacob C. Ten Eyck</a>. Perhaps, he had been married earlier to a woman named "Agnietie." In any event, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>Barent Pieterse established a mill (called a sawmill in 1645) north of Beverwyck/Albany and then built a stone house south of Albany and overlooking the Hudson River where he later settled. He is said to have purchased the tract that became known as the <a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans Patent</a> from the Indians in 1672 or '73.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#6155">1697</a>, the census of Rensselaerswyck configured his household with four men and three children - but no women. 

<p>Although primarily a resident of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, he did own property within the Albany <a href="../../citylimits.html">city 
        limits</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#6155">1684</a>, his 
        Albany taxes were in arrears. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6155">1709</a>, 
        his third ward lot received a minimal assessment. 
<p>Barent Pieterse Coeymans appears to have died intestate. In October 1712, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were <a href="andcoey.html#letters">issued</a> to his eldest <a href="andcoey.html">son</a>. Barent Pieterse is known as the <a href="../../res/ts.html">leg</a>endary founder of the town of <a href="http://www.coeymans.org/community/town-history.html">Coeymans</a>. The "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariaanje_Coeymans_House">Coeymans house</a>" there remains an outstanding historical landmark. </p>
