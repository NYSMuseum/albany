<strong>Maria Cuyler</strong></a> was born in November 1702. She was a daughter in the large family of <a href="jocuyler546.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../t/elstbroeck42.html">Elsie Ten Broeck</a> Cuyler. She grew up in a prominent businessman's home located on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>In October 1733, she was almost thirty-one when she married her slightly younger cousin <a href="../t/cotbroeck31.html">Cornelis Ten Broeck</a> at her father's Albany house. By 1740, two children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Ten Broecks lived on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> where Cornelis was a businessman, skipper, and city official in a career that spanned five decades. In 1771, she was <a href="../../wills/willcotbroeck31.html">named</a> heir and co-executor of her husband's estate. He died in January 1773. 
 
<p>Living next door to her son, <a href="../t/jotbroeck55.html">John</a>, Maria Cuyler Ten Broeck carried on for a number of years as head of their <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> household. Her daughter, <a href="../t/catbroeck7.html">Catharina Wray</a>, became separated from her husband and may have lived with her mother in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#596">1788</a>, she still was considered the head of the third ward household located next to that of her son. Her name then dropped from city rolls.</p>
