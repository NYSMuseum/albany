<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Wouter De Foreest</strong></a> was born in November 1725. He was the second son of <a href="jedef4711.html">Jesse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2035.html">Neeltie Quackenbush</a> De Foreest. He grew up a middle child in the third ward home of an Albany mainstay and city official.

<p>In April 1749, he was among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=volume+9&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q&f=false">ordered</a> to appear at city court to answer questions regarding the destruction of market buildings in the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1750">1750</a>, he was named constable in the third ward.

<p>In September 1754, Wouter was almost thirty when he married a much younger <a href="../b/engbradt.html">Engeltie Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their first child arrived only two months fafter the wedding. However, Engeltie died after bearing only three children. In August 1763, Wouter married <a href="../c/alclute1553.html">Alida Clute</a> also in Albany. By 1776, the second marriage had produced seven more children - all of whom were christened at the Albany church where he was a member and pewholder.

<p>Wouter raised his combined family in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where his property was modestly valued on city assessment rolls from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> thru <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4748">1788</a>.   

<p>In his fifties at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> he would have been too old for normal military service. In 1775, he did contribute to the relief of Ticonderoga.  However, he was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4748">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>After the war, he was in his sixties and continued to live near the northern border next to (or perhaps with) his older brothers <a href="phdef4737.html">Philip</a> and<a href="isdef4726.html"> Isaac</a> or his married <a href="sadf4743.html">sister</a>. While Philip, Isaac, and sister Sara <a href="../../census1790.html#4737">lived</a> on for a decade of more, Wouter's household was no longer configured on the city census. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a> he was dead by 1790, and his widow and dependant children would be absorbed in the nearby households of their kin.

<p>In August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">1797</a>, a <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> ravaged the area as <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#water">reported</a> in a newspaper article that "The dwelling house and stable was destroyed by fire - house on Watervliet Street . . . belonging to Widow De Foreest; occupied by her and Mrs. Low."

<p>With unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on for <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">now</a> - still seeking defining information on the later life and passing of Wouter De Foreest.</p>
