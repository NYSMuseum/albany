      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Godfredius Dellius</b></a> was the pastor of the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> during the 1680s and 
        90s. He was born in Europe about 1650. He was called to Albany in 1683 
        to assist the aged Dominie <a href="../s/gidschaets.html">Gideon Schaets</a>.</p>
      <p>Because Schaets continued to preach until 1690, Dellius focused more 
        on missionary work during his early years in New York. He displayed a 
        particular interest in converting and educating the Native peoples of 
        greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany</a>. On a number of occasions 
        he received funds from the province of New York for missionary purposes.He 
        also occasionally ministered to the Christians in Schenectady, Kinderhook, 
        and Kingston.</p>
      During the mid-1680s, he took charge of the negotiations that brought title 
      to "the Pasture" - encompassing a large chunk of the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">southern 
      side</a> of Albany, to the his church. The church held title to that tract 
      until 1815.
      <p></p>
      <p>In 1696, Governor Fletcher <a href="../../inprog.html">granted</a> Dellius 
        and others a large tract of land (537,600 acres) north of the <a href="../../na/sarapat.html">Saratoga 
        Patent</a>. The so-called "Dellius Patent" occasioned great conflict among 
        the various interests in provincial landholding. However, it was nullified 
        as a subsequent governor understood that it was not in the best interests 
        of the crown. But, early on, the patent had served notice that Albany 
        people would be active paticipants in the initiatives to parcel out investment 
        <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> in New York.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#055">1697</a>, his home was configured 
        on the Albany census. Two years later, he joined with other Albany notables 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5319">swearing allegiance</a> to 
        the king of England.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1699pmc">1699</a>, some of these 
        Albany people petitioned for the reinstatement of Dominie Dellius. But 
        by that time, Dellius had returned to Holland. 
      <p>His wife's name was Isabella and the marriage produced at least two daughters 
        baptized in America.</p>
      <p>Dominie Godfredius Dellius died on March 1, 1710.</p>
	  
<p>Today, "Dallius Street," on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">southside</a> of Albany and running south from <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson</a> until it meets <a href="../../streets.html#green">Green</a>, commemorates this early Albany cleric.</p>
