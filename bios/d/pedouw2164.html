<FONT face="arial"><P><A href="#biography"><B>Petrus Douw</B></A> was born in March 1692. He was the fifth child and second son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
            residents Jonas Douw and his first wife, Magdalena Quackenbush Douw.</P>

<P>In October 1717, he married <a href="../vr/anvr5059.html">Anna Van Rensselaer</a> at her father's house in Albany. That act connected the upper middling Douws to the most affluent family in the region. At age twenty-five, Petrus was several years <a href="../../marriages.html">older</a> than most early Albany grooms. However, the marriage was fruitful as their <a href="pedouwfam.html">nine</a> children were baptized in the Albany Dutch church between 1718 and 1736. Anna Douw died in 1756 but Petrus did not re-marry as he was <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#douw">surrounded</a> by a number of adult daughters - two of whom would never marry.</P>

<p>These Douws shared in the family's <a href="#holdings">extensive holdings</a> on the south side of the city of Albany. Following an established family pattern, Petrus was a businessman and skipper of some note. In his earlier days, he was an officer in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> and was known as "Captain." He also was active in pursuing investment <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a>.  Petrus Douw retained his Albany holdings where he was known as the senior member of his family even into the <a href="../../census1756.html#98">mid-1750s</a>. He was elected to represent Albany in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> and served from 1747 to 1758.</p>

          <p>During the early 1740s, he built a country home on the east side 
            of the Hudson. The retreat was within Rensselaerswyck and was called 
            "<a href="douw.html#wol">Wolvenhook</a>." A decade 
            later, Petrus had moved across the Hudson where he lived for the rest 
            of his life. His Albany holdings and offices fell to his son <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert 
            Petrus</a> while the grandchildren were frequent guests at the Wolvenhook 
            farm.</p>

 
<p>Petrus Douw died suddenly on August 21 1775. However, he had lived eighty-three years.</p>
