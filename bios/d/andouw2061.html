<strong>Anna Douw</strong></a> was born in March 1743. She was a daughter in the large family of Albany leader <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert P. Douw</a> and his wife <a href="../d/adp7822.html">Anna De Peyster</a> Douw. She grew up in family homes in Albany and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html#greenbush">across</a> the Hudson. He father was named <a href="../../mayors.html">Mayor</a> of Albany in 1761.  

<p>A few months later, in November 1761, Anna married emerging merchant <a href="../t/dtbroeck35.html">Dirck Ten Broeck</a>. He also was the son of a mayor of Albany. The marriage apparently was childless as no children were christened at the Albany church.

<p>This well-born couple settled into the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home Dirck had inherited from his father. In 1765, she was named chief heir in the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck35.html">will</a> of her husband as for long as she remained a widow. No children were mentioned in Dirck Ten Broeck's will.

<p>However, she would enjoy neither family nor estate as Anna Douw Ten Broeck died in February 1774. She was a few months shy of her thirty-first birthday. Her husband passed in 1780.</p>
