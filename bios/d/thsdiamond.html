<P><a href="#sources"><b>Thomas S. Diamond</b></a> was born about 1737. Antiquarian <a href="#lmrc">sources</a> say that he was of <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> ancestry, was in Boston in 1759,and that he settled in Albany after the American Revolution. However, he was in Albany by the mid-1760s when his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house and lot were noted on the city assessment roll. In 1767, he was included on the roster of the Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. He was a member and officer of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>.
		
<p>He has been <a href="http://74.125.95.132/search?q=cache:mxUSGfmn2iYJ:www.hartgen.com/userfiles/Wheeler%2520HRVR%252021%25201%2520(Fall%25202004).pdf+lansingburgh+%22thomas+smith+diamond%22&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">called</a> a Boston carpenter who was one of the builders of the Patroon's <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">new home</a> north of Albany.

<p>In 1771, he was living above the East <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> and was the first clerk of the new town of <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>. In the years following, he seems to have settled in Albany where he lived the remainder of his life. 
 
<p>His wife was <a href="../m/mamclane4307.html">Mary Mc Lane</a> - the mother of his children. He was member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. He also witnessed baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where his grandchildren were christened! Albany and regional resident <a href="wmdiamond7873.html">William M. Diamond</a> probably was his sole surviving son.</p>
		
<p>We seek information on his activities during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7872">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>In 1779, his first ward property appeared on Albany assessment rolls. During the 1780s and 90s, his name appeared on a variety of community-based records and documents. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7872">1790</a>, his first ward home on the south side of <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a> included two men, two females, and a slave. He also leased a lot south of Wolf Street from the city.</p>
		
<p>Thomas S. Diamond died in July 1796 at the age of fifty-nine. He was buried on August 25, 1796 in the Presbyterian church cemetery plot. His <a href="../../wills/willthsdiamond.html">will</a>  identified  his wife (but not by name), son William, two daughters, and a granddaughter. It passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> on August 31. His widow died in 1817.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Thomas S. Diamond (aka Thomas Smith Dimont/Dymond) is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 7872. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. In 1794, a portrait painted for him was noted in <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra Ames's</a> account book. At this point, we have not established his connection to the <a href="http://www.deyermond.com/">Deyermond family</a> of the Albany area.
