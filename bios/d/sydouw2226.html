<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sybrant Douw</strong></a> was born in March 1767. He was the son of <a href="pwdouw.html">Peter W.</a> and <a href="../vs/ryvschaick3979.html">Ryckie Van Schaick</a> Douw. He was a middle child in the relatively small family of an Albany leader. He was named for his maternal <a href="../vs/sgvschaick.html">grandfather</a>, a former mayor of Albany.

<p>In 1791, Sybrant's name was on a roster of <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemen</a> in the first ward.

<p>In March 1794, he married Albany native and sheriff's daughter <a href="../t/lyte4894.html">Lyntie Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where their two children were christened in 1794 and 1798.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and ground and separate lot all in the second ward were valued on the annual city assessment. The Albany <a href="../../census1800.html#2226">census</a> in 1800 showed eight family members and five slaves in his second ward household. From its placement on the census, it appears that Douw's residence was located west of the core city.

<p>Beginning in 1800, he was listed among the city's licensed tavernowners.

<p>Forty-two-year-old Sybrant Douw died in March 1809 and was buried from his church.</p>
