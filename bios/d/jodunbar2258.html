      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Dunbar</b></a> probably was born during the 
        1670s or 80s. He was the patriarch of the <a href="dunbar.html">Dunbar</a> 
        (Ten Barr/Tumber) family of Albany and Schenectady.</p>
      <p>About 1708, he married Albany native <a href="../w/bawinne2819.html">Bata 
        Winne</a>. Their son was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> in November 1709. A few years later, he was one of the founders 
        of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters'</a> Anglican church. In April 
        1715, he was one of the church leaders liable to be <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA186&lpg">prosecuted</a> 
        by the Albany government for improperly encroaching on city land. They 
        were arrested and posted bail. He served as a church warden at St. Peter's 
        for a number of years.</p>
      <p>These Dunbars lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
        where his property was <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2258">assessed</a> 
        at a moderate rate. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, he 
        was among the freeholders living in the first ward. The Dunbar home probably 
        was on upper State Street near the English church.</p>
      <p>Dunbar's first wife died before April 1724 when he married a much younger 
        <a href="../vh/mavh6412.html">Maria Van Hoesen</a> at the Albany Dutch 
        church. At that time, he was called the widower of Bata Winne! His second 
        marriage produced several more children who were baptized in Schenectady. 
        As many as six of his offspring from two marriages survived their father.</p>
      <p>He was called an innkeeper and later a vintner. He moved to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        about 1730.</p>
      <p>John Dunbar filed a <a href="../../wills/willjodunbar2258.html">will</a> 
        in April 1736. It named two daughters and a young son and detailed substantial 
        property and holdings. He died in Schenectady in May. His will passed 
        probate on July 19, 1736.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of <a href="dunbar.html">John

      <p>According to a <a href="http://users.bigpond.net.au/neech/weblinks/tombs1.htm">listing</a> 
        of tombstone inscriptions from the old cemetery in Schenectady, John Dunbar 
        was born August 30, 1670 and died May 6, 1736. </font size></p>
