<strong>William Dunbar</strong></a> was born in July 1744. He was the son of <a href="rodunbar2268.html">Robert</a> and Cornelia Spoor Dunbar.

<p>In June 1770, he married fellow Albany resident <a href="../vd/elvdu5520.html">Elizabeth Van Deusen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1785, five children had been christened in the church where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>By 1766, his name was found on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> - along with his mother and <a href="ledunbar2262.html">brother</a>. William Dunbar was an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#2275">mainstay</a> and a resident of Van Tromp Street in Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> for many decades. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2275">1800</a>, his third ward household was configured on the Albany census.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1768">1768</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>During the war years, he was a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">soldier</a> in the New York Line and was a member of Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> companies as well. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2275">land bounty right</a> for service with the city militia regiment.

<p>In 1787, his account was paid from the city treasury. In 1791, he was chosen fireman. In 1795 and 1795, he was identified as the superintendant or city watchmen.

<p>In August <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, William Dunbar was identified as a shoemaker and freeholder in the third ward.

<p>From 1813 until his death, his home at 6 <a href="../../streets.html#tromp">Van Tromp</a> Street was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> and he was identified as a paver.


<p>William Dunbar lost his wife when Elizabeth died in June 1822. He died in July 1825 and was buried with her in the Dutch church plot. He had lived eighty-one years. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in August.

The life of William <a href="dunbar.html">Dunbar</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 2275. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. A number of individuals of this name were alive in the colonies and early United States. Hopefully, we have carefully avoided introducing erroneous external information to this essentially local story. <p></p>
