<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Peter David</strong></a> was born in March 1764. He was the son of <a href="jodavid7772.html">John</a> and <a href="../w/elwyn6205.html">Elizabeth Wyngaert</a> David. He grew up a middle child in the large family of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside shopkeeper.

<p>Although he would have been nineteen at the end of the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war</a> in 1783, his name was on the list for a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7790">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>In July 1784, he was just twenty when he <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=jpf&id=I06227&ti=4317">married</a> a young woman named <a href="../c/elcaldwell.html">Elizabeth Caldwell</a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Colwell) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1800, seven children had been christened in Albany. A number of additional children are <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Hz0BAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22peter+david%22+caldwell&source=bl&ots=f1tONLlsC9&sig=DfFOCDVBUi3t6hslJcEQBpvJ_-k&hl=en&ei=_9w4S9yqBM_DlAf0qISbBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20david%22%20caldwell&f=false">said</a> to have been born before Elizabeth died in 1808. She most probably was a relative of the Albany <a href="../bioindex.html#c">C</a>aldwell brothers as sons were named James and Joseph Caldwell David and Peter's property was associated with that of the Caldwells. 
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7790">1790</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household first appeared on the city census.  However, in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued either under the house of his widowed mother or under the store of <a href="../c/jacaldwell7509.html">James Caldwell</a> (perhaps his wife's uncle) whose holdings appeared after the property of Peter Davis. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7790">1800</a>, his first ward household included seven children.

      <p>Elizabeth Caldwell David died in 1808. After that, we are <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%22davis+nathaniel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22davis%20&f=false">less certain</a> that 
        available community-based information applies to this particular Peter David. <a href="../../inprog.html">Perhaps</a> 
        he worked for James Caldwell and was employed elsewhere. </p>
