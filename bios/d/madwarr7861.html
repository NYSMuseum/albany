<strong>Maria De Warran</strong></a> probably was born during the 1690s. We seek information on her origins and early life.

<p>In November 1720, she married <a href="../s/thsharp7016.html">Thomas Sharp</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1737, the marriage had produced at least six children. Four of them were living in 1771 while at least four others were buried by the church during the 1730s and 40s.

<p>Over more than two decades, these Sharps raised their family in the second and then first <a href="../../wards.html">wards</a> as Thomas was <a href="../../census1756.html#111">known</a> in the community as a barber and placeholder. He also witnessed a number of baptisms in the Dutch church. However, Maria was not listed among the baptism sponsors.
 
<p>After twenty-eight years, the marriage came to an abrupt end when the "wife of Thomas Sherp" was buried by the Dutch church in November 1749. Her husband, a prominent <a href="../../stpeters.html">Anglican</a>, survived for several decades. Consequently, she was not mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willthsharp.html">will</a> Thomas Sharp filed in March 1771. Maria De Warran Sharp had lived for about fifty years.
