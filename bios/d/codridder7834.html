<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis De Ridder</strong></a> was born in July 1701. He was the son of legendary Albany schoolteacher <a href="evdridder7830.html">Evert De Ridder</a> and his wife, <a href="../vn/anvness.html">Anna Van Ness</a> De Ridder. He grew up in the middle of a large family perhaps residing at the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany. A number of his siblings married and raised families in Albany but more prominently in its surrounding <a href="../../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a>.

<p>In November 1725, Cornelis married Albany native <a href="../vd/suvdb5841.html">Susanna Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced at least two children during its short life span. In July 1733, he married a somewhat younger "<a href="#some">Gerr</a>itie Van Noezen" (perhaps <a href="../vh/gerrvh766.html">Gerritje Van Hoesen</a>). At that time, Albany church records identified both partners as young people of Albany. By 1741, that marriage produced at least two children. Both sets of offspring reflected the names of the grandparents. 

<p>Beyond family information, we have not yet encountered Cornelis De Ridder in the community-based record.  The De Ridders are <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ffI7AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=de+ridder+saratoga&source=bl&ots=iMC3mdVBgT&sig=iOkiaefoMhjpJIYoC0cSV675sF8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=I3wyVYrnOe3_sASs04DwBg&ved=0CF0Q6AEwCg#v=onepage&q=de%20ridder%20saratoga&f=false">said</a> to have been among the earliest settlers of <a href="http://genealogytrails.com/ny/saratoga/permanentsettlers.html">Sara</a>toga/<a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> documentation for this Cornelis De Ridder in that connection.
	  
<p>Cornelis De Ridder (perhaps the only individual at risk in the region) was buried from the Albany church in April 1744. Perhaps this short-lived Albany native did not live to see his <a href="andridder5696.html">daughter</a> become the wife of Albany leader <a href="../y/abyates1.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a></p>
