<P><A href="#biography"><B>Nicholas Drury</B></A> probably was born during the 1730s or 40s.

<p>By the 1760s, he was living in Albany. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his house and lot were listed on the Albany assessment roll. In 1767, he married spinster Catherine Smith in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, he identified himself as an Albany County "skipper." From 1768 on, they were members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> Anglican church. Their family may have included ten children - with Sara being baptized at St. Peters in 1788.</P>

<p>Drury was a river person - perhaps in league with his brother-in-law, skipper <a href="../../bios/p/wpemberton420.html">William Pemberton</a>. In 1771, he was made a member of the Albany night watch. At that time, his first ward house included a number of boarders.

<p>We seek information on his activities during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">W</a>ar for Independence. In 1777, he was paid by the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany committee</a> for transporting Tories from Albany to Esopus - implying that his boat still was operational.</P>

<p>In 1790, he was living in a modest <a href="../../census1790.html#7890">house</a> on the southside. A few years later he had moved across town to Pearl Street where his family of four was listed on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#7890">1800</a>.</p>

<p>The last recorded reference to Nicholas Drury came on the assessment roll in 1802!</p>

      <P><FONT size=-1><A href="../../criteria.html"><IMG align=left alt="the people of colonial Albany" border=1 width=30 height=30 hspace=4 src="../../images/jpg/logoicon.jpg" vspace=4></A> <a name=biography>The life of <B>Nicholas Drury/Druly/De Ruley/Drewry</B> is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 7890. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a> His origins top the list of unknown particulars regarding his life - although family tradition holds that he came from London, England about 1750. A shipwreck (particulars unknown) claimed all on board except for young Nicholas and his brother Samuel. We are indebted to Asta Bredsdorff for the preceding information. The dearth of information on his work history, involvement in the Revolutionary war, and family record may tell us that much of his adult life was not spent within the Albany orbit. A son, Henry, was born in Sorell, Canada but baptized at St. Peter's in 1785.</p>
