      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sara De Wandelaer</strong></a> was born 
        in April 1687. She was the daughter of Manhattan natives <a href="jodewan6162.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../s/saschepmoes.html">Sara Schepmoes</a> De Wandelaer. Her 
        family moved to Albany during the 1670s and she grew up in a prominent 
        businessman's home located in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In June 1705, she was among the eight children named in the <a href="../../wills/willjodwand.html">will</a> 
        filed by her father. 
      <p>In December 1706, Sara was nineteen when she married <a href="../vi/frvi2353.html">Frederick 
        Myndertse</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        The first of their ten children was born four months later. 
      <p>This <a href="../vi/vi.html">Mynderts</a> family lived in Albany's first 
        and third wards where Frederick practiced the family trade of blacksmithing. 
      <p>Sara De Wandelaer Mynderts died in December 1732 at the age of forty-five. 
        Her youngest child was only three-years-old. Her husband survived until 
        1740.</p>
