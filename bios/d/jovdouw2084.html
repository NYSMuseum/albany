<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Jonas V. Douw</strong></a> probably was born during the 1650s. He was the first son born in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="vjd.html">Volkert Janse</a> and <a href="../vb/dovbred.html">Dorothe Van Brestede</a> Douw. 
 
    <p>In November 1683, he married <a href="../q/magq2192.html">Magdalena Quackenbush</a> 
      at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a lifelong 
      member and frequent baptism sponsor. Before Magdalena's death, the marriage 
      produced four children who were christened at the Albany church. In April 
      1696, he took for his second wife <a href="../w/cawitbeck1708.html">Catharina 
      Witbeck</a>, the widow of Jacob Sanderse Glen. 
    <p>Jonas Volkerts was a landholder and businessman who was known as "Captain" recognizing his commission in the county <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. He held property in Albany but made his <a href="../../census1697.html#2084">home</a> across the Hudson in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.  




<p>After a month-long illness, Jonas V. Douw died in October 1736. He was buried on the Douw family property in Greenbush.
