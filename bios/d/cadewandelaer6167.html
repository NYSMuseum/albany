      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina De Wandelaer</b></a> was born in August 
        1689 and baptized in the Albany Dutch church. She was the daughter of 
        Manhattan merchant and Albany landowner Johannes and his wife, <a href="../s/saschepmoes.html">Sara 
        Schepmoes</a> De Wandelaer. Her <a href="../huguenot.html">Hug</a>uenot 
        father came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> from Leyden. 
        She grew up in her father's homes on Manhattan and in Albany.</p>
      <p>In June 1705, she was among the eight children named in the <a href="../../wills/willjodwand.html">will</a> 
        filed by her father. 
      <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/cadewandelaer.jpg" align=right width=175 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="Catharina De Wandelaer Gansevoort"></a>She 
        married brewer <a href="../g/leegansevoort4656.html">Leendert Gansevoort</a> 
        in May 1712. By 1730, their eight children had been baptized in the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were frequent 
        baptism sponsors. </p>
      <p>A "sickness" swept through Albany during the winter of 1731-32 - decimating 
        the city's population. Virtually every household was effected. Catharina 
        lost daughters <a href="../g/sgans.html">Sara</a> and Agnietie during 
        that troubled time. 
      <p>These Gansevoorts were Albany mainstays - living in the Gansevoort homestead 
        on <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a> and augmenting 
        the family <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewing</a> business. Traditional 
        sources have accorded <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/gansevoort.html">much 
        credit</a> to her for developing Leendert's enterprises.</p>

<p>Leendert Gansevoort died in 1762. Catharina was named sole beneficiary 
        during her widowhood. The <a href="../../wills/willleengansevoort.html">will</a> instructed her not to dispose of any of 
        the estate but to benefit from its incomes. Her name appeared on an assessment 
        roll as the owner of their substantial <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a> home and lot in 1767. Catharina De Wandelaer Gansevoort died 
        in August 1767 - days shy of her seventy-ninth birthday.</p>
