      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John De Garmo</strong></a> was born in February 
        1735. He was the son of <a href="jedgarmo809.html">Jellis</a> and <a href="../e/raeverts7999.html">Rachel 
        Everts</a> De Garmo. He grew up in a smaller family in a leatherworker's 
        home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. His father also 
        worked a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning pit</a> along Foxes 
        Creek. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a>, he was chosen to be the 
        constable in the first ward. The following June he was replaced as De 
        Garmo was in "His Majesty's Service." Apparently, he was beginning a career 
        in the military. In 1760, he was identified as a lieutenant in <a href="../vv/jovvechten2532.html">John 
        Van Vechten's</a> Albany company. Two years later, he was named captain 
        for an expedition into the Indian country. In 1764, he returned to Albany 
        with 14 Indian prisoners.
		
<p>At this point, we are not convinced that he was the Johannes De Garmo 
        named in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#934">1763</a> on a list 
        of Albany freeholders; or who signed a constitution for the Albany Sons 
        of Liberty in <a href="../../solconst.html">1766</a>; or whose property 
        was valued on subsequent assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a>. 
        We are careful to not confuse him with <a href="jodgarmo933.html">Johannes 
        M. De Garmo</a>. 
      <p>In December 1763, he would have been twenty-eight when he married Albany 
        spinster <a href="../h/suhogan4393.html">Susanna Hogan</a>. The marriage 
        probably was childless. 
      <p>In May 1764, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willjuhogan.html">will</a> 
        filed by his in-laws.
      <p>This John De Garmo was dead by November 1774, when his widow remarried.</p>
