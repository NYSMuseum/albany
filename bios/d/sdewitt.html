<strong> </strong></a><strong><a href="#dewitt">Simeon De Witt</a></strong> was born in 1756, one of the fourteen 
            children of Dr. Andries De Witt and Jannetje Vernooy of Ulster County. 
            A native of Wawarsing, he grew up in the mid-Hudson backcountry. <a href="sdewitt.html#portrait1"> 
            <img src="../../images/jpg/sdewittea150.jpg" border=1 width=150 height=189 alt="Simeon De Witt" hspace=4 vspace=4 align="right"></a>This 
            physician's son was sent to Queens (<a href="http://www.rutgers.edu/TimeLine/">Rutgers</a>) 
            College in New Brunswick, New Jersey where he was its only graduate 
            in 1776.</P>

<P>As his father and kinsmen were prominent supporters of the Revolutionary cause, with the outbreak of war Simeon De Witt joined a company of students who were dispersed when the British captured New Brunswick. De Witt fled to New York City and then joined the Revolutionary army. Trained as a <a href="../../trades/sur.html">surveyor</a> by his uncle, James Clinton, in June 1778 he was appointed assistant geographer to the army under  Colonel <a href="#erskine">Robert Erskine</a>. In that capacity he helped craft a large body of seminal maps that now are in the collection of the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/revolutionary.html">New-York Historical Society</a>. Following the death of Erskine, he was named "Geographer and Surveyor of the Army" in December 1780.</P>

<p>After the war, he was appointed "Surveyor General of New York State" and settled in Albany. His office in the new state building on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> was the center of intense activity during the postwar period - as the new "Empire State" was being mapped out. He held that office until his death in 1834. Over a long career, his experience often was solicited by New York and interstate commissions charged with developing the New York landscape and settling disputes.</p>

<p>Simeon De Witt's residence along <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> was listed on the <a href="../../census1790.html#dewitt">census of 1790</a>. A few years later, he built a landmark house on the site of old <a href="#huey">Fort Orange</a>. De Witt <a href="../../census1800.html#7864">lived</a> at that riverside location (finally called 549 South Market Street) thru the 1820s.<p>


<P>In 1789, he married <a href="../l/ellynott.html">Elizabeth Lynott</a>, the daughter of an Irish trader turned farmer. After bearing two children, Elizabeth died in 1793. A few years later, De Witt married the widow Jane Varick Hardenberg - a niece of the mayor of New York City. Their son, Richard Varick De Witt, became a distinguished civil engineer. Jane V. H. De Witt died in 1808. Simeon De Witt later married for a third time to Susan Linn. He was a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Reformed Church</a>. During the early 1800s, he was one of a number of Albany residents to manumit their slaves. By 1810, four former slaves were free members of his household.</P>

<p>As Surveyor General, Simeon De Witt's name was intertwined with the <a href="http://www.nymapsociety.org/FEATURES/ALLEN2.HTM">development</a> of central and western New York.  His office surveyed, approved, and filed literally hundreds of land documents. Not surprisingly, he owned substantial acreage in the Finger Lakes region. His obituary called him one of the founders of 
<a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk7/ch7.html">Ithaca</a>.</p>

<p><a href="sdewitt.html#portrait2"><img src="../../images/jpg/sdewitt.jpg" border=1 width=150 alt="Simeon De Witt about 1830" hspace=4 vspace=4 align="left"></a>Headquartered in Albany, this state official was an advocate of economic and cultural betterment. In 1791, he was among the founders of the "Society for the Promotion of Agriculture, Arts, and Manufactures." Later, he was vice-president and then, from 1813 to 1823, president of the organization that later became the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany Institute of History and Art</a> . He served on the New York State Board of Regents and was named chanceller of the University of the State of New York in 1829. Among many others, he also was a member of the American Philosophical Society.</p>
 
          <p> During the 1790s, De Witt had purchased lands at the southern end 
            of Cayuga Lake. He is credited for applying a Latin name to the settlement that became 
            Ithaca. After 1828, he retired to his East Hill estate. Simeon De 
            Witt died in Ithaca December 1834 at the age of seventy-nine. He was 
            buried on his property there but his remains later were removed to 
            the Albany Rural Cemetery.</p>

          <p>De Witt's outstanding contribution to the history of Albany stems from his 
            survey work on behalf of the city. His often-reproduced <a href="../../map/mapdewitt.html">base 
            map</a> of the city in 1790 was utilized for many years. Subsequent 
            versions featured a projected street grid that patterned development 
            of Albany beyond its ancient core for the next two centuries.</p>
