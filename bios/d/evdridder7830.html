<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Evert De Ridder</strong></a> probably was born during the 1660s. He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been a <a href="http://genealogytrails.com/ny/saratoga/permanentsettlers.html">son</a> of <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> Gerrit De Ridder. We seek specific documentation on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.
 
<p>In April 1688, "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gBpEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=%22Apr.+1.+First+banns.+Evert+De+Ridder%22&source=bl&ots=ay78DEWfW8&sig=JtaPWcvco2WF14nIyWS8mNw4in0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UXVLVeXzNvX8sAS4-YHwCA&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Apr.%201.%20First%20banns.%20Evert%20De%20Ridder%22&f=false">Evert De Ridder</a>" married <a href="../vn/anvness.html">Anna Van Ness</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were noted as "living here." By 1713, eleven children had been christened at the Albany church. 		
<p>His name appeared on the initial membership <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part1.html">list</a> (dating from 1683) of the Albany church along with that of his wife.

<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, Evert De Ridder was a schoolteacher in Albany as early as 1688. In 1703, Evert Ridder of "this County" <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WqApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=ridder&source=bl&ots=3_wEkYUtvV&sig=45Brm-Dfv-hYJQmKT66cj9FN-5Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=X_snVcLyONHHsQTp44HQCg&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=ridder=false">appeared</a> before the city council, petitioned and was granted "his freedom in the city" and to be "a free citizen." He then applied and was granted "permission to teach schoole in the Citty."

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#1">1689</a>, an  Albany assessment showed that his home was in the first ward. Eight years later, in <a href="../../census1697.html#7830">1697</a>, the census showed "Evert Ridder" living in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7830">1709</a>, his third ward 
        property was valued on the Albany assessment roll. In 1710, Albany records 
        identified him as collector (of taxes). 
<p>Provincial <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MZurlZfg1fAC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=%22de+ridder%22++albany&source=bl&ots=z8rwrtNiSB&sig=0rcCDNvZAxAa5wkdJf5gK-cefCo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8fInVcKmBLLksATwooCIBQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22de%20ridder%22%20%20albany&f=false">records</a> show that one Evert De Ridder was commissioned a lieutenant in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> by Jacob <a href="../l/leisler.html">L</a>eisler in 1690. Subsequently, he was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WqApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA269&lpg=PA269&dq=%22evert+de+ridder%22&source=bl&ots=3_wEkXZvAX&sig=o0k83T-4jx2wXu9s4nLXn5vz4Fk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1OgnVcH9MPHLsATomYH4CQ&ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22evert%20de%20ridder%22&f=false">identified</a> as a lieutenant of the volunteers sent to Schenectady to pursue those who destroyed the village.

<p>Evert De Ridder was last mentioned in the records in January 1713 in conjunction with the baptism of his last daughter.

<p>With important but unresolved issues regarding the life of this legendary character but without verifiable resources, we move on for now.</p>
