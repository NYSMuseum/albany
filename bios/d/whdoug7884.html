<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, one-time Albany innkeeper <a href="#sources"><strong>Wheeler Douglass</strong></a> was born in April 1750. He was the son of <a href="http://www.douglashistory.co.uk/history/asadouglas.htm">Asa</a> and Rebecca Wheeler Douglass. He grew up a younger son in the large family of Connecticut yankees who moved west after the French <a href="../../7yw.html">and</a> Indian War. In 1766, his parents were among the first settlers of Stephentown, New York. His father and older brother were prominent members of the Revolutionary army from the region along the New York-Massachusetts border.

<p>In August 1773, Wheeler married Martha Rathbone of Stonington, Connecticut. At that time, he was living in Stephentown. By 1793, the marriage produced at least ten children - many of those offspring would survive to have <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6YehIsw-eF8C&pg=PA652&lpg=PA652&dq=%22wheeler+douglass%22&source=bl&ots=qZlrzNZVv8&sig=OxQ-45XAx7KYD1R8akir4lvlTqY&hl=en&ei=LHI0TIfeBoOB8gag86XKCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCoQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22wheeler%20douglass%22&f=false">notable</a> lives and careers.

<p>He is <a href="http://www.stephentowngenealogy.com/douglasgenealogy.html">said</a> to have relocated to Albany in 1780 where he established the firm of "Douglas & Wheeler" and also operated an inn. As a newcomer innkeeper, he was watched by the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">commissioners</A>. In August 1780, he was among those who were required to post <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GuH0Jp1290MC&pg=PA488&lpg=PA488&dq=%22wheeler+douglass%22&source=bl&ots=SjY5wvjA8i&sig=Yf8IX-Mu7gfD4b3Dr2zR5KBSGRU&hl=en&ei=8Z80TOD5NMOclgfgpMjVBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCYQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&q=%22wheeler%20douglass%22&f=false">bail</a>. He also was permitted to post bonds on behalf of others. He seems to have been involved in a number of business associations.

<p>In September 1780, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA310&lpg=PA310&dq=%22wheeler+douglass%22&source=bl&ots=wwkKcZBbjw&sig=qvmn-kT-1-GBGz7MIxK4QQHU0H4&hl=en&ei=u-A1TPyoK8aqlAeEoIHWBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22wheeler%20douglass%22&f=false">engaged</a> by the Albany council to supply meats to the city market, In July 1784, his landmark establishment was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA195&lpg=PA195&dq=%22gerardus+beekman%22+%22douglass's%22&source=bl&ots=NHf_CzETTl&sig=VcAmR4Q3bEIAFZK96jAX-3-cAMM&hl=en&ei=oP18TJLoDMKblgfQtfDqCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&sqi=2&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22gerardus%20beekman%22%20%22douglass's%22&f=false">referenced</a> in an Albany newspaper. 


<p>After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7884">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. Later, he would purchase the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RuATAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA350&lpg=PA350&dq=%22wheeler+douglass%22&source=bl&ots=3WiphVu1_N&sig=MINA0zX_tIN6zT_Zc9KRCR70CDY&hl=en&ei=A3g0TO_zLYP_8Abj97HJCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22wheeler%20douglass%22&f=false">bounty rights</a> of a number of Revolutionary War veterans.

<p>Wheeler Douglass was an active participant in the post-war <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market. He is best known for the so-called "Wheeler Douglass Patent" - tracts on the west side of Lake George obtained in 1794. In 1789, he held title to a <a href="http://www.joycetice.com/books/1879c04.htm">tract</a> of 4450 acres in Tioga County. He also held property with other family members in what became the state of <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/proceedingsofver00inverm/proceedingsofver00inverm_djvu.txt">Vermont</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7884">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for Watervliet.

<p>In <a href="http://history.rays-place.com/ny/ren-lansingburgh.htm">1794</a>, his name was among those of the founders of the <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> library. He also was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#7884">Masonic</a> lodge.

<p>A fire seems to have destroyed his Albany holding in 1797. By 1798 or 1799, he had <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/histryburford00muiruoft/histryburford00muiruoft_djvu.txt">removed</a> to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_River_(Ontario)">Grand River</a> valley in Upper Canada where he acquired land and set up a milling operation.

His widow survived until 1837.</p>
