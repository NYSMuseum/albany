<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Edward Davis</strong></a> appears to have been born during the 1720s. At this point, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">think</a> that "<a href="nedavis.html">Ned</a> Davis" was a younger individual, probably a "<a href="../../afroalbanians.html">negro</a>," and perhaps even the slave of Edward. That said, possibly three different individuals are in the mix here. Not surprisingly, a <a href="http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/11425773/person/2065754314/story/6107b524-cf88-42e0-8e92-9a1e4996cc90?src=search">number</a> of same-named individuals lived in early America. 

<p>Perhaps he was the son of John Davis of New York City as noted in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=%22davis+john%22&source=bl&ots=4RJk-xlOUN&sig=a2h0cXRVdCUAHficX4YMYVJDfy4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SZoiUNzDNKnX0QG5vIC4Bw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22davis%20john%22&f=false">will</a> he filed in 1731.

<p>In October <a href="http://threerivershms.com/mustermcginnis3.htm">1755</a>, the name of Edward Davis was listed on a muster roll of New York Provincial Troops. 

<p>After posting a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">bond</a> in November 1762, in January 1763, Edward Davis married "Jannetje Duret" (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Dret or Durette) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1778, they (Edourd and in one case Ned.) had baptized at least seven children in Albany. Edward and Jannetje witnessd baptisms at the church as late as 1790.

<p>In 1772 and again in 1785, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">account</a> was paid from the city treasury.

<p>Beginning in May 1776, his activities were noted by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> when he was paid for firewood and for repair work on the barracks. In May 1777, he was paid $100 for "his service in discovering a number of conspirators." Shortly thereafter, his "stay" in Albany was paid for and John Davis was paid for lodging and feeding Edward Davis.  

<p>In November <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#7766">1778</a>, his was among those identified as aged 50-55 who would be exempt from active military service except in an emergency. Afterwards, his name was not on the list of patriots accorded land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">bounty rights</a> in conjunction with either the city militia regiment or another military unit.
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7766">1790</a>, the household of Edward Davis was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> and included six people. A decade later, the Watervliet <a href="../../census1800.html#7766">census</a> noted eleven "free white" people residing in his household.

<p>After that, the name of Edward Davis appears to be absent from the community-based record. Perhaps, his wife was one of the two Davis-named widows listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%22davis&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22davis&f=false">1813</a>.

<p>We recognize that this sketch may have been developed based on unrelated parts. With so many unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> (particularly regarding birth, marriage, and death) on the life of Albany resident Edward Davis, we move on for now.</p>
