      <P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Daniels</strong></a> probably 
        was born during the 1730s. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. While being flexible regarding <a href="../../res/sp.html">variable 
        spellings</a> of his name, we strive to focus on the Albany resident of 
        the 1750s and 60s and not compress information on other at-risk contemporaries 
        into his early Albany life. Perhaps, "John Danielson" was the same person. 
        At this point, we suspect that an older same-named individual was the 
        person <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/chburmen.html">buried</a> 
        from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in December 
        1754. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1751">1751</a>, "John Danels" was named one of the constables for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.   

<p>In June 1752, "John Danielson" married young <a href="../h/geerhilton7793.html">Geertruy Hilton</a> at the Albany church. At that time, both partners were identified as single people of Albany. In 1753, they christened a daughter at the Albany church where he witnessed christenings and was <a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> known as "John Danels." In February 1755, their son was <a href="../../stpeters.html">baptized</a> by Reverend John Oglivie.
		
<p>In May 1762, the name of "John Danalson" appeared on the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ULAFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA436&lpg=PA436&dq=%22john+danalson%22&source=bl&ots=aDXupc0_mq&sig=xLyTKZIC0LDa2VgcdYmxxODZerk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBWoVChMItNLJp-SZxwIVxVk-Ch3FqgPa#v=onepage&q=%22john%20danalson%22&f=false">roster</a> 
        of Captain John Visscher's company "raised and passed in Albany." At that 
        time, he was identified as aged twenty-four and a native of Ireland. He 
        also was called a "Mariner" and was listed as 5 feet five inches tall.</p>

<p>Available Albany assessment rolls from the 1760s do not seem to consider his holdings.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA803&lpg=RA12-PA803&dq=danalson&source=web&ots=hq0KulgrC3&sig=KO3WO4tIB1dP9VDxGJLcFoFoa8s#v=onepage&q&f=false">1767</a>, "John Danalson" was identified as a private in an Albany militia company.

<p>Between July 1767 and March 1769, a "John Donaldson" sought and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false">received title</a> to "Lot #3" <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">located</a> on the North side of Lydius Street to Hamilton Street between Eagle and Haw Streets. 

<p>After that, plausible references are numerous yet varied in name and place. Thus we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the Albany life of "<a href="../../res/sp.html">John Daniels</a>."
