<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rachel De Peyster</strong></a> was born in May 1728. She was the daughter of <a href="jodp.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/anschuyler932.html">Anna Schuyler</a> De Peyster. She was the younger of two surviving offspring of the union of elite Albany families. She grew up in her father's <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> home from where he would be named mayor of Albany in 1729 and would be a <a href="../../cityfathers.html">pillar</a> of the community until his death in 1789. Her mother died in 1750. 

<p>In September 1750, Rachel married Albany native <a href="../t/tote4830.html">Tobias Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The couple soon settled in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where seven children would be baptized by 1766. Named for her illustrious father, their son, <a href="../t/jodpte4891.html">Johannes De Peyster Ten Eyck</a>, became a prominent Albany resident after taking up residence in Rachel's father's landmark house.  

<p>These Ten Eycks were among Schenectady's leading families throughout the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a> of the American Revolution.

<p>In August 1774, Tobias made out his <a href="../../wills/willtote4830.html">will</a>. It left his estate to Rachel during her widowhood and then to their six living sons. The will passed probate following Tobias's passing in February 1785.  

<p>In death, Tobias H. Ten Eyck was reknowned as one of the wealthiest residents of Schenectady. His widow, Rachel De Peyster Ten Eyck, passed on in April 1787 just before her fifty-ninth birthday.</p>
