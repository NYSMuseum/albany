<strong>Volkert Douw, Jr.</strong></a> was born in September 1699. He was the son of <a href="hedouw2083.html">Hendrick</a> and the widow <a href="../vi/comvi2340.html">Cornelia Van Iveren</a> Van Bergen Douw. His father's large, combined family lived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and on Papsknee Island. He was known as "Volkert H." and as "Volkert Douw, Jr."

<p>About 1719, he is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22volckert,+jr.,+son+of%22&source=bl&ots=aNKANsMawI&sig=XEuRelSVGXf8g-6p3TTPnJEAYHM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiY9M6Ev6zMAhXFcz4KHYaUAHsQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&q=%22volckert%2C%20jr.%2C%20son%20of%22&f=false">said to have</a> married <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> Margarita Vanderpoel. In 1720, he was mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willelizteller.html">will</a> of her mother. Perhaps that marriage was childless. By 1732, he had married Albany native <a href="../h/anhogan4314.html">Hanna Hogan</a>. By 1740, at least four children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1735">1735</a>, he was appointed constable for the first ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2231">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of first ward freeholders. 
 

<p>In 1749, "Volkert Dow, Jr." was left a birthright (as the eldest son) and other financial bequests in the <a href="../../wills/willhedouw.html">will</a> of his father. Earlier, he had been mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">will</a> of his father-in-law. 

<p>Volkert Douw, Jr. was last heard from in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=%22volkert+H+douw%22&source=bl&ots=wxjCfVxgiw&sig=oFxjVHZHU_AbWnnKBO3KfPkUCAU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JAMdUcqmN8ny0QH-44GgAQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22volkert%20H%20douw%2C%22&f=false">July 1759</a> when the account of Volkert H. Douw was among those paid by the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> of Albany.

<p>Perhaps he was the Volkert Douw who was identified on a list of Albany freeholders in <a a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#vd">1763</a>.</p>
