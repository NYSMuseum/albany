<strong>Philip De Foreest</strong></a> was born in October 1720. He was the eldest son of Albany natives <a href="jedef4711.html">Jesse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2035.html">Cornelia Quackenbush</a> De Foreest. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of Albany mainliners. His father lived until 1756 and his mother until 1773. Many family demographics are recorded in the leafs of the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible16.htm">bible</a> kept by members  of Philip's family.

<p>By the late 1740s, he had married <a href="../vn/ravness1004.html">Rachel Van Ness</a>. By 1761, six children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were pewholders and, during the 1750s, regular baptism sponsors. His wife probably had passed by the 1770s, but Philip does not seem to have re-married.

<p>Philip De Foreest was a <a href="../../census1756.html#46">cooper</a> who set up his home near the river in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany where he was a <a href="../../census1790.html#4737">fixture</a> for the remainder of the eighteenth century. Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> valued <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4737">his</a> third ward holdings <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4737">moderately</a>. He held a number of service positions including <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">firemaster</a>, gauger of bushels (1772), and guardhouse keeper (1775). On a number of occasions, he performed tasks for the city government and was paid from the treasury. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4737">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>Fifty-two at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, we seek comprehensive information on his specific wartime activities. In 1775, he was among those who <a href="../../sources.html#cc">contributed</a> for the relief of Ticonderoga. Otherwise, his name appears only in the non-war-related community based records. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4737">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 



<p>In August 1797, a large <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#water">fire</a> destroyed his house, stables, and workshops on "Watervliet [Market] Street" occupied by Philip De Foreest and others. Later that month, his name appeared on a list of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">freeholders</a> for the third ward. He was identified as a cooper. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his unoccupied lot in the third ward was valued on the Albany assessment roll. After that notice, <a href="../../inprog.html">at this point</a> no references to him have been encountered in the community-based record. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of this Albany mainliner.
