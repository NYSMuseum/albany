<P>Referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Elizabeth Dunns</strong></a> was the wife and widow of Albany newcomer <a href="../p/jepotts.html">Jesse Potts</a>. She is <a href="../p/jepotts.html#sources">said</a> to have been from Glasgow, <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>land. However, we seek more definitive information on her precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In 1796, she is said to have married Jesse Potts in Albany. By 1811, the marriage had produced at least six children.

<p>Jesse Potts died in December 1811 at the age of thirty-seven. Potts's chronicler later <a href="../p/jepotts.html#potts">noted</a> that "he left a widow and several small children and very limited means of support, but through thrift and energy she supported her family and brought them up in respectability." 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1813ad">1813</a> and afterwards, "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22potts%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22potts%22&f=false">Widow Potts</a>" was listed in the city directory as the operator of a boarding house at 44 Quay Street while residing at 52 Dock Street.

<p>As late as 1830, "Widow Elizabeth Potts" was listed in the city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a>. At that time her residence was at 51 <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius</a>.
