<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelia De Foreest</strong></a> was born in February 1723. She was the daughter of <a href="jedef4711.html">Jesse</a> and <a href="../q/coq2035.html">Neeltie Quackenbush</a> De Foreest. She grew up in a large family in the third ward where her parents were Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#52">mainstays</a> for several decades.

<p>Perhaps she married Albany native <a href="../f/isfonda3784.html">Isaac Fonda</a> in 1748. By 1760, six children reflecting the relevant names of both families were christened in the church where she owned a pew and witnessed a number of baptisms. However, she <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible16.htm">died</a> with the birth of her last child during the winter of 1760.

<p>Thirty-seven-year-old Cornelia De Foreest Fonda was buried from her church in February 1760. A few years later, her church pew was transferred to her daughter. Her husband, Isaac I. Fonda, may have survived for several decades.</p>
