<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina De Foreest</strong></a> was born May 1749. She was the daughter of <a href="phdef4737.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../vn/ravness1004.html">Rachel Van Ness</a> De Foreest. She grew up in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> home of a cooper and city retainer who was a Market Street <a href="../../census1790.html#4737">mainstay</a> perhaps thru the end of the century. 

<p>In January 1767, she married <a href="../d/anddouw2058.html">Andries V. Douw</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1781, six children had been christened in the church where she was a member and pewholder.

<p>Catharina and Andries began to raise their family in the third ward <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2058">home</a> of his widowed mother. Following Rachel's death in 1780, these Douws took control of the family property. However, Andreas died early in 1783 leaving Catharina and the children in the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4720">house</a> at what became 10 <a href="../../streets.html#orange">Orange Street</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4720">1790</a>, she was listed on the census as the head of the household and living with a boy, two other females, and two slaves. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#4720">later</a>, her third ward household exhibited a similar configuation.

<p>The first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22douw+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22douw%20+widow%22&f=false">1813</a> and the listings for the next decade, included the widow's home at 12 Orange Street.


<p>Widow Catharina De Foreest Douw died in August 1823. Her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</A> passed probate in May 1848. </p>
