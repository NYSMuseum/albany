<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referenced variously, <a href="#sources"><b>Johannes V. Douw</b></a> was born in January 1709. 
        He was the second son of the marriage of <a href="vodouw2228.html">Volkert</a> 
        and <a href="../vt/mgtvtricht6603.html">Margarita Van Tricht</a> Douw. Mostly, he grew up on family property <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">across</a> the river in Greenbush. To prevent confusion with other same named contemporaries, this sketch focuses on the individual identified as "John V. Douw." </p>

      <p>He married <a href="../b/jabogert6068.html">Jannetje Bogert</a> about 
        1737. By 1750, their eight children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>.</p>
      <p>By the 1740s, he was establishing himself as a <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur 
        trader</a> and interpreter while building a life for his family in the 
        <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> of Albany. In 1744, he was 
        appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In 1746 and 
        '47, he was elected assistant alderman. Although his house was not included 
        on the census in <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, his Albany 
        property was assessed during the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>. 

		
<p>Johannes V. Douw was a well-known Albany merchant and his name was included 
        on a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#2092">petition</a> signed by Albany 
        traders in 1764. He supplied items for the city government. He also witnessed 
        a number of wills including <a href="../../wills/willvodouw2233.html">that</a> 
        of his wife's brother-in-law in June 1768.</p>

<p>Identifying himself as "of Albany County," Johannes V. Douw filed a <a href="../../wills/willjovdouw.html">will</a> in December 1777. It stated that he was "weak and sick in body." Implying that his wife was deceased at that time, Douw left an extensive estate to his son. He was dead by January 1782 when the will passed probate.</p>
