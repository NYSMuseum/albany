      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Susanna De Ridder</strong></a> (<a a href="../../res/sp.html">Sa</a>ntje) 
        was born in September 1727. She was the second daughter of Albany-area 
        residents <a href="codridder7834.html">Cornelis De Ridder</a> and his 
        first wife <a href="../vd/suvdb5841.html">Susanna Vandenbergh</a> De Ridder. 
        Before long, her mother died. In 1733, widower Cornelis remarried and 
        fathered more children. 
      <p>In March 1758, "Saintje" married <a href="../w/jowinne2983.html">Johannes Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Both partners were then called residents of Albany County. By 1781, six children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Winnes raised their family in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and were Albany mainstays during the 1760s and <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2983">'70s</a>.

<p>After that, Jan/Johannes Winne has not yet been connected to the community-based record. Perhaps he left the city or moved in with family members. However, he seems to have died in 1797 and a will passed probate in Albany County in June. 

<p>Whether Susanna De Ridder Winne was still alive and how long afterwards she might have lived remain unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>. </p>
