<strong>Isaac Denniston</strong></a> was born about 1760. He was the son of innkeeper <a href="hdenniston5136.html">Hugh</a> and <a href="../vv/ravvlk1401.html">Rachel Van Valkenburgh</a> Denniston. He grew up in a large family in the Catskill area and came to Albany when his father took over a landmark tavern in the late 1770s. In 1785, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willhdenniston.html">will</a> filed by his father.

<P>Following Hugh Denniston's death in December 1785, Isaac took over management of his father's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> inn and/or tavern. This Albany landmark was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4108">valued</a> under his name for several decades. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4108">1790</a>, his household included nine family members (and other residents)  and two slaves. Ten years later, four slaves and eleven family and boarders made up his first ward <a href="../../census1800.html#4108">home</a>.

<p>In June 1787, he married <a href="../v/elvisscher4112.html">Eleanor Visscher</a> at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a>. At least five children were subsequently christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>Building on the successes of his father and the connection to his in-laws, the <a href="../v/visscher.html">Visschers</a>, Isaac Denniston became a pillar of the new city that emerged after the Revolution. He sat on the Boards of a number of Albany-based corporations and organizations. By 1803, he was identified as a "gentleman." 

<p>In 1809, he "owned" twenty-five feet of space on the Albany docks in partnership with <a href="../w/dawaters6821.html">David Waters</a>. 

<p>He also was a noted horticulturalist perfected a plum during the early 1800s.

<p>In 1817, he was appointed by the governor to be one of the managers of the lottery in New York State.
 
<p>By 1818, he had built a substantial <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jzM8wF0vWdQC&pg=PA305&lpg=PA305&dq=%22isaac+denniston%22&source=web&ots=yfU0Dgj-B8&sig=xg5UlS4KnMoULxU077q54kUFIOE">building</a> known in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> as "Mansion House" on Lydius Street.


<p>Later on, he was referred to as "the venerable Isaac Denniston" and was the only living <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UATv4fSk6xkC&pg=PA293&lpg=PA293&dq=%22isaac+denniston%22&source=web&ots=cGrxMjYNje&sig=6uIrR2CknjUROjuGZoIjQjlvPi8#PPA293,M1">witness</a> to a disturbance surrounding the ratification parade in Albany in 1788.


 <P>This Isaac Denniston died in 1853. His son and namesake became a prominent Albany attorney - hopefully not confused here with the profile of his long-lived father.</p>
