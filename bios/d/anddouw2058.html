<P>According to family-based <a href="../../fhg.html#nnf">res</a>ources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Andries Douw</strong></a> was <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/genealogicalnote00talc#page/72/mode/2up">born</A> in October 1745. He would have been the son of <a href="vodouw2233.html">Volkert  A.</a> and <a href="../b/rabogert6143.html">Rachel Bogert</a> Douw although his parents appeared to have not actually married until 1752. He grew up in a small family in a businessman's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In January 1767, he married <a href="../d/cadef4720.html">Catharina De Foreest</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> By 1781, the marriage had produced at least six children who were christened in the church where he was a pewholder. Only a daughter lived to raise a family of her own.

<p>In June 1768, he was noted in the <a href="../../wills/willvodouw2233.html">will</a> filed by his father. Acknowledged as the sole son, he received a substantial birthright and a share of the rest of Volkert A. Douw's estate.

<p>Drawing on his inheritance, these Douws raised their family in the home of his widowed mother. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2058">1779</a>, third ward assessment rolls valued his personal property under the house of widow Rachel - although he had inherited half of the house from his father. At that time, he was among those who were taxed on a <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2058l">lot</a> in the second ward. 

<p>A quarter owner of his father's still, he received almost all of the rest of the estate upon his mother's passing in 1780.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, "Andrew" became involved in the work of the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a>. In 1776, he was chosen captain of the "Association Company." He seems to have served the American cause on the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">homefront</a> at least thru 1777. He often was referred to as "Captain." Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2058">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia company.


<p>Andries Douw died in January 1783. His widow survived until 1823.</p>
