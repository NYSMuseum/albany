<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William De Witt</strong></a> was an Albany resident during the late 1770s and 1780s. The existence of several same-named contemporaries (in a number of other  states as well) dictates caution in the assignment of information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and other social attributes. He most likely was one of those 18th century William De Witts born and raised in Ulster County. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=y_cLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=%22william+de+witt%22++ulster+county&source=bl&ots=MHHATL4Gnu&sig=vNrAMDqkW-iVwjI8F4ot5D5JjNA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=D5ToT4GoJ6Lk0QGQ-JyLCg&ved=0CGEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22william%20de%20witt%22%20%20ulster%20county&f=false">Perhaps</a> his father was Andries De Witt of Rochester, Ulster County. Based on subsequent <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">info</a>rmation, he would have been born prior to 1738.

<p>Mindful that a number of same-named individuals would be <a href="../../res/guess.html">at risk</a>, William De Witt, a cordwainer, a was made a freeman of New York City in October <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=%22william+dewitt%22&source=web&ots=W4zL6h-NDG&sig=jgYAaGL-vhXYjpAzBa2ydE2OjSg#v=onepage&q=%22william%20dewitt%22&f=false">1765</a>.

<p>This individual's wife probably was Hester Dy<a href="../../res/sp.html">k</a>man who he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x1tZgEUVAUUC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22hester+dykman%22++de+witt&source=bl&ots=ZPmZiKvqp0&sig=Lfp_5qwH22h-ZHYD9HA1Aqvvpak&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CtrpT5iWEYGJ6gHn0_mIDQ&sqi=2&ved=0CEsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22hester%20dykman%22%20%20de%20witt&f=false">married</a> at the Dutch church in New York in May 1770. Their son, William, was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FJYyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA45&lpg=RA1-PA45&dq=%22hester+dyckman%22++dewitt&source=bl&ots=q8DnjCAthS&sig=RUBLUqLBnjTCAStesH6gPudIca4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ztfpT6G4JOLq0gHa5pm3DQ&ved=0CE0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22hester%20dyckman%22%20%20dewitt&f=false">baptized</a> at the New York City Presbyterian church in April 1773. Two children were christened by them at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part6.html">1779</a> and 1781.

<p>Without established origins for now, we do know that he was known in Albany by the late 1770s.

<p>We seek definitive information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>time service. In November 1778, he was among those, fifty years old and older, who was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#7868">exempted</a> from military service in Albany. Afterwards, his name appeared on a list of those men who qualified for a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7868">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7868">1779</a>, his house and holdings in the third ward were assessed substantially.

<p>In June <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5vm7k0yfMesC&pg=PA729&lpg=PA729&dq=%22william+dewitt%22&source=bl&ots=uJF3jgBoaB&sig=nd1HhvYN2LCl_ImCrR93fruonkU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ccPpT6zNH6aA6gGNgMWeDQ&ved=0CE4Q6AEwAzhk#v=onepage&q=%22william%20dewitt%22%&f=false">1781</a>, he informed the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> that he had been taken prisoner on the <a href="../../na/khook.html">K</a>inderhook road while on his way to Albany from Philadelphia. He was questioned by his captor and then released. Later, he reported to the Board on a number of matters.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1781">1781</a>, he was appointed chimney viewer for the second ward.


<p>In February 1783, <i>The New-York Gazetteer</i> newspaper advertized that William De Witt had ". . . re-opened business near Gen. <a href="../t/abtbroeck6.html">T</a>en Broeck's, Goods, Suitable for all Seasons: Broadcloths, silk, cotton and linen, Cutlery Ware: knives and forks, knitting needles, etc. Stationary: ledgers, spelling books, etc. Articles sold for cash, ship timber, planks, boards, shingles, clap-boards, staves and hoops. Even old Continental Money will be received in payment." After that notice, his name seems to have dropped from the community-based record. 

<p>He seems to have <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dbDiRQ2YOHYC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22william+de+witt%22++ulster+county&source=bl&ots=P9O-Z-JIlr&sig=2oS_hs4zgJeA6vb1GWVVF6Zeca8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=T7PoT5eLEOqe6QHRuuTfDg&ved=0CFwQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&q=%22william%20de%20witt%22%20%20ulster%20county&f=false">returned</a> to Ulster County and possibly died there in 1828. 



<p><a href="http://archive.org/stream/cu31924082451364/cu31924082451364_djvu.txt">Perhaps</a> he was dead as early as 1788 when the will of a William De Witt passed probate in Ulster County. However, important <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> remain regarding his origins, family life, and passing. </p>
