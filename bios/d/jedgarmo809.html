      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jellis De Garmo</strong></a> was born in 
        May 1704. He was the son of Frenchman <a href="pdegarmo947.html">Pierre 
        De Garmo</a> and Albany native <a href="../vd/cavdh5675.html">Catharina 
        Vandrheyden</a> De Garmo. He grew up in a large family in several locations 
        as his father struggled to make a living beyond the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur 
        trade</a>. 
      <p>In January 1731, he married <a href="../e/raeverts7999.html">Rachel Everts</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, five 
        children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism 
        sponsor. 
      <p>These De Garmos lived in the first ward where Jellis was listed among 
        the qualified voters in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#809">1742</a> 
        and in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#809">1763</a>. 
      <p>In October 1767, he obtained a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lot</a> 
        from the city of Albany along the north side of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a>. It may have been called lot #15 and was <a href="../../im/im1794.html">bounded</a> 
        by Fox and Hare Streets and was between Hawk and Swan. In September 1768, 
        the city council confirmed the deed and stated that the property was to 
        be used as <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning pits</a>. 
      <p>In 1773, he purchased a lot of land near the Dutch church pastures from 
        <a href="../h/anthallenbeck5247.html">Anthony Hallenbeck</a>. That year, 
        he witnessed a <a href="../../wills/willishogan4320.html">will</a> and 
        was identified as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a>. 
      <p>He owned as many as seven pieces of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> 
        in the first and second wards. The assessment rolls for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a> 
        valued his lots and tan yard as well as his residence located near <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court</a> 
        and Hudson Streets. 
      <p>Jellis De Garmo filed a <a href="../../wills/willjedgarmo809.html">will</a> 
        in March 1779. It named his wife and son as heirs to his real and personal 
        estate. Two years later, he was referred to as "Old D' Garmo" and had 
        a Continental soldier living at his house. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7999">1788</a>, 
        his widow and son were listed on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> assessment roll. His will passed probate in 1796.</p>
