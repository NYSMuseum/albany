          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Anna De Peyster</B></A> was born in Albany 
            in March 1723. She was the daughter of State Street mainstays <a href="jodp.html">Johannes</a> 
            and <a href="../s/anschuyler932.html">Anna Schuyler</a> De Peyster.</P>

<p>Growing up in a landmark <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> home, she lost all but one of her seven siblings early in life. But as the daughter of the <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany and surrounded by numerous Schuyler kin, she had an advantaged childhood that brought her into contact with the most prominent families in the region.</p>

          <P>Just past her nineteenth birthday, Anna married rising Albany merchant <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert 
            P. Douw</a>. Between 1743 and 1760, their nine children were baptized 
            in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both 
            parents were members, pewholders, and frequent baptism sponsors.</P>

          <p>During the 1750s and 60s, these Douws were central personages in Albany society. 
            Anna's civic-minded husband served as <a href="../../mayors.html#vpd">mayor</a> 
            of Albany from 1761 to 1770. By the end of his tenure at city hall, 
            the middle-aged couple had relocated to the Douw family estate across 
            the Hudson at "<a href="douw.html#wol">Wolvenhook</a>" 
            - leaving their city-based business to the <a href="#sons">next generation</a>.</p>

<p>Anna's Greenbush home was spacious and was served by a large number of servants. Located on the river road south of the Van Rensselaer seat at Crailo, the Douws lived out their days in country comfort.</p> 

<p>Two months after her seventy-first birthday, Anna De Peyster Douw died at Wolvenhook in June 1794 and was buried in the family cemetery. Her husband died in 1801 and was buried nearby.</p>
