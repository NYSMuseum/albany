<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Lydia Douw</strong></a> was born during the early 1740s. However, her baptism record has not been found in the available Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church records</a>. Also, her parents appear to have been married in 1752. She seems to have been the eldest daughter of <a href="vodouw2233.html">Volkert</a> and <a href="../b/rabogert6143.html">Rachel Bogert</a> Douw. She grew up in the home of an Albany businessman and officeholder.

<p>In September 1765, she married <a href="../o/heoo430.html">Hendrick Oothout, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1786, the marriage had produced as many as eleven children.

<p>In 1768, she was named an heir and co-executor in the <a href="../../wills/willvodouw2233.html">will</a> filed by of her father. Thus, she ultimately stood to inherit a half share of a substantial estate.

<p>At this point, we <a href="../qqqq.html">have not</a> been able to connect this Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">native</a> and mother to a life in the city. However, her husband appears to have been a prominent resident of Albany and/or its environs.

<p>We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on the adult life and passing of Lydia Douw Oothout </p>
