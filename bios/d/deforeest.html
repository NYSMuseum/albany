      <P>The Albany <a href="#sources"><b>De Foreest</b></a> family is descended 
        from Manhattan native <a href="phdef4706.html">Philip De Foreest</a> who 
        had settled in Albany by 1680. We would group these French speaking Protestants 
        with the <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenots</a>.</p>
      <p>His sons, <a href="jedef4711.html">Jesse</a> and <a href="jodef4712.html">Johannes</a> 
        were Albany mainstays. 
<p>The family spread into the Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a>. Today, the family name is represented in the Rensselaer County hamlet of "Defreestville." 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, two De Foreests (Jesse and Johannes) were included on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>In <a href="">1756</a>, two named households (<a href="isdef4726.html">Isaac</a> 
        and the recent <a href="../q/coq2035.html">widow</a> of Jesse) appeared 
        on a census of Albany householders. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a>, three De Foreest men 
        were counted among Albany's freeholders 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, three De Foreest households 
        were listed on the Albany census including the third ward home of merchant/pilot 
        <a href="isdef4726.html">Isaac De Foreest</a>. Three more "De Freests" 
        were listed in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1815</a>, two "De Forest" named households 
        were included in the city directory.</p>
<p>The "<a href="http://www.defreest.com/">DeFreest Family Home Page</a>" presents a variety of material on the family and a number of interesting perspectives.</p>

      <p><a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> These biographies are derived chiefly 
        from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The <a href="../../fhg.html#def">standard 
        work</a> on the family is by Emily Johnston de Forest and was published 
        in 1915. It chronicles the traditional story of the family - mostly in Europe. <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/deforest.html"><i>HMGFM</i></a> 
        presents the seminal antiquarian work on the family done by <a href="../r/cureynolds.html">Cuyler

<p><a href="../../res/sp.html">Spellings</a> of the name vary widely! Defreest/De Forest/de Vries! We have adopted the spelling "De Foreest" for consistency and convenience.
