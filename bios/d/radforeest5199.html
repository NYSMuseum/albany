<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Rachel De Foreest</strong></a> was born in December 1769. She was the daughter of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">East Manor</a> residents Philip and Maayke Vandenbergh De Foreest. Perhaps she was their <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%22deforeest,+philip+and+maayke+van+den+bergh%22&source=bl&ots=I8vp6PH4OC&sig=oa_0TuCwT1cDtWduOET7xcGM2w8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG7LmslIbTAhWj6oMKHWFOAM8Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22deforeest%2C%20philip%20and%20maayke%20van%20den%20bergh%22&f=false">only child</a>.

<p>In August 1797, she married <a href="../g/joagoewy.html">John A. Goewy</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The first of several children was christened there in July 1798.

<p>These Goewys made their home near the city's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">northern border</a> - a short distance from where John practiced the saddler's trade. In time, their <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22goewey%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22goewey%22&f=false">residence</a> would come to be known as 209 North Market Street.

Her husband lived on in their Market Street home until his passing in 1828. Both of them were <a href="../../dead.html">interred</a> in the Dutch church "burial ground" until their remains were finally removed to the <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.</p>
