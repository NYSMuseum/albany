      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Volkert Dawson</strong></a> may have been 
        <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rbillard/schenectady_baptisms.htm">christened</a> 
        in the <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/cl_da.html">S</a>chenectady 
        Dutch church in September 1731. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YckUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=dawson+albany+denison&source=web&ots=Ks4UAoCVJG&sig=SCacOypX_9xZXeQ8n4FundAeYzw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA516,M1">If 
        so</a>, he would have been the son of cooper William "Daasen" and his 
        wife, Ariaantie Veeder Dawson and would have been named for her father, 
        Volkert Veeder. Despite a somewhat familiar name, at this point, we do 
        not believe he is connected to the Albany <a href="douw.html">Douw</a> 
        family. 
      <p>Consequently, we probably need external information to follow this individual 
        through his first thirty years. 
      <p>In February 1761, he married the widow "Geertruy Denison" (otherwise called 
        <a href="../h/geerhilton7793.html">Geertruy Hilton</a>) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. At that time, both were said to have been "of Albany." By 
        1778, several children had been christened at the Albany church. A number 
        of additional Dawson children presumably had been christened elsewhere. 
        Perhaps, he witnessed on two baptisms at the Albany Dutch church. 
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and 1767, his modest 
        Albany holdings were valued on city assessment rolls in the first and 
        second <a href="../../wards.html">wards</a> respectively. 
      <p>About 1771, his name was included on a list of those who acquired lots 
        in the new settlement that would become <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>. 
      <p>In December 1771, the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> reported 
        that "Volkert Dawson, from New York, has arrived here [Albany] at 8 o'clock 
        in the afternoon." 
      <p>In April 1775, the name "Volkert Dawson" was on a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FHo4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA826&lpg=PA826&dq=%22volkert+dawson%22&source=web&ots=-dpU7EfJxr&sig=aZ-2bVbd0r2b_68PM1C0L2_mBrQ&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result">list</a> 
        that included residents of Albany County who were incarcerated for debt. 
      <p>In August 1776, he was <a href="../../coc.html">appointed</a> to replace 
        <a href="../s/samstevenson.html">Samuel Stevenson</a> as keeper of the 
        <a href="../../friends.html">T</a>ory jail. He seems to have <a href="../../coc.html">actively 
        served</a> in that capacity at least into 1779. However, his name was 
        absent from other community-based resources for the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> 
        years. Also, we have not yet connected him to actual service or to any 
        land bounty rewards. 
      <p>Both before and after the war, he was paid for services from the city 
        treasury. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7796">1788</a>, his personal 
        property was valued on the city assessment roll near the first ward holdings 
        of the "Widow Van Sante" and John Murphy. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7796">1790</a>, 
        his household was enumerated on the first ward census next to those listed 
        near him in 1788. His name seems to be absent from the assessment roll 
        of 1799 and the census of <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a> as 
        well. 
      <p>Volkert Dawson died in June 1808 and was buried "gratis" from the Albany 
        Dutch church.</p>
