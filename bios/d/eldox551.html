<strong>Elizabeth Dox</strong></a> was born in April 1744. She was the daughter of Abraham and Rebecca Marselis Dox. She probably grew up in the Albany <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">countryside</a>. We seek more information on her family life!  

<p>She was the wife of merchant <a href="../k/wmkane2529.html">William Kane</a> - although she does not appear to have been <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> in an Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church</a>. The marriage produced several children. Into the 1790s, she was a pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> while her husband was a <a href="../../presbyterian.html">P</a>resbyterian.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, William Kane was suspected of disloyalty by the Albany revolutionaries. Her fate during his troubles is presently not clear.

<p>These Kanes <a href="../../census1790.html#2529">lived</a> north of Albany in Watervliet.

<p>Elizabeth Dox Kane died in September 1793 and was buried from her church. She had lived fifty years. Her husband survived until 1812.
