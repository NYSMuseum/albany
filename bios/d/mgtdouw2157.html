      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Margarita Douw</b></a> born in November 1740. She was 
        the daughter of sloop captain <a href="abdouw2052.html">Abraham Douw</a> 
        and his first wife, <a href="../w/cawinne2826.html">Lyntie Winne</a> 
        Douw. She was nine years old when her mother died in 1749. Margarita grew 
        up taking charge of a household whose head often was sailing away from 
        Albany.</p>


<p>In May 1767, she married <a href="../t/heteyck4875.html">Henry Ten Eyck, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At twenty-six, this "spinster" was four years older than her spouse. By 1785, the marriage had produced seven children.</p>

<p>These Ten Eycks lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in Albany's second ward where Henry began to make his way as a merchant. Their lives changed when he was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County in 1770. As a royal official, he was in a precarious position as controversy became conflict during the 1770s. </p>


<p>Margarita Douw Ten Eyck was alive in 1790 and accounted for on the <a href="../../census1790.html#4875">census</a>. Her husband died in 1795. Perhaps she was still alive in 1809 and living with Widow Ann Mancius - her late husband's sister!</p>
