<P><A href="#biography"><B>Volkert Petrus Douw</B></A> was born in March 1720 and baptized in the Albany Dutch Church. He was the only surviving son among the <a href="pedouwfam.html">nine</a> children born to <a href="pedouw2164.html">Petrus</a> 
            and <a href="../vr/anvr5059.html">Anna Van Rensselaer</a> Douw. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/vpdouweng200.jpg" alt="likeness of Volkert P. Douw" align=left border=0 hspace=4 vspace=4 width=200></a> 
            He learned the family business growing up at Albany's busiest intersection 
            and at the <a href="douw.html#wol">family farm</a> located across the 
            Hudson.</P>

          <P>At age twenty-two, he married young <a href="adp7822.html">Anna De Peyster</a>. 
            Over the next eighteen years, she gave birth to nine children who 
            were baptized in the nearby <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where 
            both parents were members and where Volkert became a prominent church 
            officer.</P>

          <p>After some time as a skipper, "Captain" Volkert P. Douw was given the freedom 
            of Albany in 1749 - thus qualifying the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
            native to conduct business in the chartered city. Under his father's 
            guidance, Volkert tended the family store and sought opportunities 
            for further advancement. By the <a href="../../census1756.html#99">1750s</a>, 
            he had taken over for the aging Petrus and had become a fixture on 
            the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a>. He represented 
            the first ward as an assistant and then alderman from 1748 to 1758. 
            In that year he was appointed recorder of the city. In 1761, he was 
            commissioned <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany and served 
            until 1770.</p>

          <p>During the 1750s and 60s, Volkert <a href="#initial">P.</a> Douw was among 
            the most prominent of Albany personages. <a href="#sig"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigvpdouw2234.jpg"  align=right width=275 border=0 hspace=0 vspace=4 alt="signature and seal of Volkert P. Douw"></a> 
            <a href="../../cityfathers.html">City Father</a> and churchman, he 
            was a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia officer</a> and served 
            in the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. He was a longtime 
            judge and justice (1757-75), member of the provincial Assembly (1757-68), 
            and <a href="../../cia.html">Indian Commissioner</a>. During the War 
            for Independence, he served the American cause as a Rensselaerswyck 
            member of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>, 
            delegate to the Provincial Congress, and as a commissioner and commissary 
            to the Indians.</p> 

<p>His public standing was based on heritage but was greatly enhanced by the large fortune he amassed through trading, exporting, contract business, and land management. During his mayoral tenure, the Albany holdings alone identified him as among the city's wealthiest residents.</p>

          <p>His father died in 1775. By that time, fifty-five-year-old Volkert P. Douw 
            had become patriarch of the Albany Douw family. His two <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#douw">unmarried 
            sisters</a> shared the family's substantial city home. Volkert relocated 
            permanently to Wolvenhook - leaving the store and his other Albany 
            business to the next generation. Douw augmented his country holdings 
            - adding additional acreage especially to the east bank estate where, 
            in 1790, his household was served by fourteen slaves.
          <p>

<p>In 1786, he was elected to the New York State Senate and served until 1793 when he retired. Volkert P. Douw died at Wolvenhook in March 1801. He was the most outstanding member of the Douw family during its first century and a half in America. This city father lived almost eighty-one years.</p>
