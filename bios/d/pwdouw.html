<P>The Albany resident generally known as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter W. Douw</strong></a> was born in 1735. He was the son of Albany skipper <a href="abdouw2052.html">Abraham Douw</a>             and his wife, <a href="../w/cawinne2826.html">Catalina Winne</a>. He was named for his bachelor uncle and benefactor, <a href="../w/piwinne3032.html">Captain Pieter Winne</a>.</P>

          <p>His <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne3032.html">uncle's will</a> made ample provision 
            for young Peter's education, left him investment property and personal 
            effects, and an equal share of a substantial estate as well. Before 
            long, he joined his father on the river. By the early 1760s, he was 
            identified as a skipper and, in 1773 he was called a "mariner."</p> 

<P>In July 1762, he married Albany native <a href="../vs/ryvschaick3979.html">Ryckie Van Schaick</a>. The couple started out in a modest home in the first ward near the waterfront. Four children were baptized in the nearby <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1764 and 1779.</P>

          <p>During the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>, he helped 
            his father in the movement of military cargoes. In 1767, his name 
            was on the roster of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. 
            As a river carrier, he was a part of Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
            Johnson's</a> business network.</p>

<p>By the mid-1770s, he was able to employ family legacies to good advantage. Moving up the hill to the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>, Peter W. Winne began to focus on his land-based business. With that came the business of public service. From <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in 1775, to  <a href="#member">member</a> of the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> in 1778, then assistant alderman 1778-83, and finally alderman for the second ward beginning in 1784, he now emerged as a fixture on the Albany city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a>.</p>

<p>In April 1788, he joined with other Albany antifederalists in publishing a <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#2165">list</a> of their objections to the proposed constitution.

<p>By 1790, he had moved again to a <a href="../../census1790.html#2165">choice location</a> in the third ward. By <a href="../../census1800.html#2165">1800</a>, the children were gone and 
            Peter and Ryckie were living in the <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">substantial home</a> on Market Street 
            attended by several servants. By 1803, <a href="../vs/ryvschaick3979.html"> 
            widow Ryckie</a> was alone in the Douw house!</p>
