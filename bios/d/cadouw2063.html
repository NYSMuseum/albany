<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Douw</b></a> was born about 1660. She was the daughter of New Netherland pioneers <a href="vjd.html">Volkert Janse</a> and Dorothe Breestede Douw. She grew up n Albany and also on her father's countryside holdings.</p>


<p>In April 1684, she married brewer-businessman <a href="../o/heoo428.html">Hendrick Janse Oothout</a>. Although they lived for a time in New York City, by 1705 their eleven children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>These Oothouts <a href="../../im/im1686.html">lived</a> near the Albany waterfront in the first ward. Hendrick Janse also had a farm near the city where the family spent considerable time.</p>

<p>Catharina Douw Oothout was not mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">will</a> of her husband filed in October 1738. At that time, she would have been about seventy-eight-years-old!</p>
