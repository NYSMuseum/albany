<P>Based on subsequent resources, <a href="#sources"><strong>William Diamond</strong></a> was born about 1771. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that his birthplace was the "new city" of <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> in what became Rensselaer County. Mostly, he was known as "William M. Diamond."  A <a href="thsdiamond.html#lmrc">number</a> of those works have <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=L25LAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=%22rebecca+wendell%22+diamond&source=bl&ots=V-4ZagAnAU&sig=ubxkhyjET6NmjK681BCXC1vY3Y0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ2ob01IDRAhUHj1QKHUA2DXUQ6AEIJzAE#v=onepage&q=%22rebecca%20wendell%22%20diamond&f=false">called him</a> the son of Albany resident <a href="thsdiamond.html">Thomas S. Diamond</a>.

<p>In August 1796, he was identified as the only son and was named among the heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willthsdiamond.html">will</a> of Thomas S. Diamond.

<p>He married <a href="../w/rewendell2707.html">Rebecca Wendell</a>. Beginning in 1800, their children were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA43&lpg=PA43&dq=%22rebecca+wendell%22+diamond&source=bl&ots=I8uq6RC5MA&sig=hUlnsC_5bvC4FPtC1UX3_AocnS8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQ2ob01IDRAhUHj1QKHUA2DXUQ6AEIITAC#v=onepage&q=%22rebecca%20wendell%22%20diamond&f=false">christened</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and property in the first ward were accorded modest assessments. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7873">1800</a>, he was listed on the Albany census of the first ward. At that time, his household included a couple aged 26-45 and two boys under ten. Subsequent census <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">listings</a> accounted for the growth and development of what became a large family.

<p>During the 1800s, "William M. Diamond" was a member of of the <a href="../../ams.html#list">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. In that context, he was known as a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a>. In December 1800, his name appeared on a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">roster</a> of city firemen. 

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">1800</a>, he bought and sold city lots as well as more extensive <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> in Guilderland and in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> where he is <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#sources">said</a> to have owned a farm that was located "along the road." He also <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=TuNPAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA120&lpg=RA1-PA120&dq=%22william+m+diamond%22&source=bl&ots=yAmwU6lSc7&sig=zJYByawDjIkw5YTVLJN-Sqxe4EQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv3N_4uqvRAhUE8IMKHSlJCY84ChDoAQhGMA0#v=onepage&q=%22william%20m%20diamond%22&f=false">was known as</a> a resident of Lansingburgh.

<p>Over the next three decades, his life had evolved probably elsewhere as he has <a href="../../na/na.html">not been located</a> during our ongoing <a href="../../res/irs.html">sweep</a> of <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. 
      <p>In March 1834, "William M. Diamond" was among those residents of the city of Albany who <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=24EFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA269&lpg=PA269&dq=%22william+m+diamond%22&source=bl&ots=k9lbC4DiSk&sig=FYC72x4XMlcfLaxwptIoCcL6i4E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjv3N_4uqvRAhUE8IMKHSlJCY84ChDoAQhJMA4#v=onepage&q=%22william%20m%20diamond%22&f=false">signed a petition</a> to Congress regarding the "Bank of the United States."

<p>In 1860, the Federal Census of the third ward enumerated the household of "Wm Diamond" aged 84. During those years, his address was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA330&lpg=PA330&dq=%22solomon+allen%22+albany&sig=SoqMkY8O3i9I-Bv3OWGeTvzZDEM&ei=iUHEUpecFdXesAT5y4C4DA&id=MZUPAAAAYAAJ&ots=fObBcZgEW8#v=snippet&q=diamond%2C%20william&f=false">listed</a> as 76 North Pearl Street.

<p>In the 92nd year of his age, William Diamond is <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/2226/32229_420302988_0018-01618/384528?backurl=%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3f_phsrc%3deQU35%26_phstart%3dsuccessSource%26usePUBJs%3dtrue%26db%3dalbanycemburialcards%26so%3d2%26pcat%3dROOT_CATEGORY%26gss%3dangs-g%26new%3d1%26rank%3d1%26gsfn%3dwilliam%26gsfn_x%3dNN%26gsln%3ddaimond%26gsln_x%3dNN%26MSAV%3d1%26msddy%3d1862%26msddy_x%3d1%26msddp%3d10%26msydy%3d1780%26msydy_x%3d1%26msydp%3d10%26cpxt%3d1%26cp%3d12%26catbucket%3drstp%26uidh%3d9w2&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnSearchResults">said</a> to have been buried in a Wendell owned plot at the Albany Rural Cemetery on February 1, 1862.</p>
