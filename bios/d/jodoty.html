<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the household of <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Doty</strong></a> was configured on the census of the first ward in <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo">1800</a>. At the same time and also <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled variously, the household of one <a href="jodougherty.html">John Dougherty</a> was enumerated on the <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo">census</a> but in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 

<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Several <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ppMPAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=%22john+doty%22+albany&source=bl&ots=sMOS_Wnkic&sig=HLyckNtHtaUthWlye7yDNXpfNf0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cCikVP7KB5a2yASDkIKQCQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22john%20doty%22%20albany&f=false">same-named</a> contemporaries are <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=90891384">at risk</a> in the region including a prominent Anglican/loyalist <a href="http://www.stgeorgesschenectady.org/history-stgeorges.html">cleric</a> sometime residing in Schenectady. Four households under John Doty were listed on the census of 1790 in New York State. This family probably is of New England <a href="../../yankinv.html">origin</a>. This sketch focuses on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> Albany resident known as John  and/or John F. Doty.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property only was valued moderately on the first ward assessment roll.

<p>In 1800, the census of his household noted two men born prior to 1774 and 1756, a boy (10-16), and two women in the same age brackets as the men. A <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">decade later</a>, two boys under 10, a male (16-25), and a man 26-45 in addition to a girl (10-16) and two women born prior to 1774 and 1756 were configured in "John F. Doty's" city household.

<p>During the early 1800s, he was listed among the <a href="../../ams.html">members</a> and in 1806 as a trustee of the Albany Mechanics Society. Later, he was an officer in the "Grand Royal Arch" <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> Lodge. 

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22doty%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22doty%22&f=false">1813</a>, Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> noted that John F. was a watchmaker with a home on  Union and then South Pearl Streets and a shop on Court and then State Streets. Among his apprentices were young <a href="../h/joshenry.html">Joseph Henry</a>, who stayed with Doty until his <a href="http://www.amphilsoc.org/mole/view?docId=ead/Mss.B.H39p-ead.xml">business failed</a>, and also Charles Selkirk <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=b4k-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA151&lpg=PA151&dq=%22john+f+doty%22+albany&source=bl&ots=NOEoT4yWCo&sig=ldgik5n4RUak6sOOYuOzDZIkWC4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DCWkVK2zHYqVyQTU2YLwDQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=john+f+doty&f=false">(1814-15)</a>. Perhaps, Henry was Doty's <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=x9E9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=%22john+f+doty%22+albany&source=bl&ots=YLOGUOvVuo&sig=gFi_BdbJnnYPqeqz_YomCt9tnNc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DCWkVK2zHYqVyQTU2YLwDQ&ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20f%20doty%22%20albany&f=false">cousin</a>.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">wonder</a> about a possible kinship connection to Albany resident <a href="jadoty1877.html">Jane Doty Bostwick</a>. 

<p>With many unanswered basic <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the life of this John Doty we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
