<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Andries Douw</strong></a> was born about 1660. He was the son in the large <a href="douw.html">family</a> of  <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="vjd.html">Volckert Janse</a> and <a href="../vb/dovbred.html">Dorothe Van Breestede</a> Douw. 
<p>Andries Volckertse appears to have been <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> three times. In June 1685, he is said to have wed a woman named "Annetje" in New York City. In June 1697, he married Elsie Hansz (<a href="../h/hansen.html">Hansen</a>) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor. She <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">died</a> in December 1699 while attempting to deliver a child.  Otherwise, those marriages appear to have been childless. In December 1702, he married Lydia De Meyer. By 1722, six of their children were christened at his Albany church.

<p>This Andries Douw lived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Renssleaerswyck</a>, on the east side of the Hudson, where his family held extensive acreage. In <a href="../../census1697.html#2057">1697</a> - just prior to his second marriage, he was listed on the Manor census in a house with two other men. During the 1680s, he was identified as the skipper of a "boat" that ran between Albany and New York. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2057">1699</a>, he joined with Albany-area worthies in swearing allegiance to the king of England. In 1715, his name was included on the roster of an Albany-based <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In 1703, he was elected to represent Rensselaerswyck in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>.


<p>Andries Douw witnessed a baptism in October 1725. After that, he seems to have been off of Albany-area rolls.
