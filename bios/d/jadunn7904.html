<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled (Donaway) and referred to variously, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Dunneway</strong></a> was born about 1740. Subsequent information tells us his father was named John. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#7904">1767</a>, "James Donoway" was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his name appeared on the city assessment roll. In 1767, "John Doneway and son" were listed on the tax list for the second ward. In March of <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7904">1779</a>, his <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lot</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was valued modestly.
 
<p>In November 1768, he married one <a href="../s/elssmith.html">Elsje Smith</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, the partners were identified as "both of Albany." By 1789, the marriage had produced at least the ten children who were christened at the Albany church.

<p>In September <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA207&lpg=PA207&dq=%22james+dunneway+for+making%22&source=bl&ots=wyhH7Rsfev&sig=uhMNcDTGgjNpP07P1-J8mxoNuCo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIqbz1razHyAIVSj4-Ch1NPAWT#v=onepage&q=%22james%20dunneway%20for%20making%22&f=false">1769</a>, he was paid &pound;6 for "making a road on Frans Bergh next to the lot of Isaac Swits." In January <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=%22dunneway&source=bl&ots=wyhH7Rtajr&sig=lBCpc_X67tdpSuLoZMDVJp6lGu8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMItdaHsq7HyAIVCXY-Ch1KlQji#v=onepage&q=%22dunneway&f=false">1770</a>, he was one of 21 men appointed to the "night watch" and who were to be paid eleven shillings. In March <a a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA235&lpg=PA235&dq=%22james+dunneway+for+1:14%22&source=bl&ots=wyhH7Rtbnu&sig=aCjDpYv99efAGyvC4VXM6n6J1kY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI59ui9q7HyAIVyD0-Ch2aNgo7#v=onepage&q=%22james%20dunneway%20for%201%3A14%22&f=false">1772</a>, he was paid &pound;1:14 from the city treasury.

      <p>Probably in his mid-thirties at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, 
        we expect to connect him to an active part of the great struggle. In May 
        <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/ABP1949.0001.001/1004?rgn=full+text;view=image">1775</a> 
        and a year later he supported the Albany effort to supply Ticonderoga 
        and was paid &pound;1:4 for firewood and repairing the barracks by the 
        Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>. In August <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GNE4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA759&lpg=PA759&dq=%22a+few+days+ago%22+james+dunneway&source=bl&ots=EJbn2LSvoi&sig=Tg1tN5uhVUvnqy24InlBxOQyc7w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAGoVChMI4eCCiLTHyAIVR48-Ch0m8Atk#v=onepage&q=%22a%20few%20days%20ago%22%20james%20dunneway&f=false">1781</a>, 
        he appeared before the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> 
        to report that he had been captured and released while in the woods five 
        or six miles from Albany. 
      <p>During those years, these Dunneways raised their family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> - probably near or on what became South Pearl Street. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7904">1788</A> and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot were valued moderately. 

<p>In <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#7904">1788</a>, the inventory of the estate of an Albany physician listed him as a debtor.

      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7904">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census in the first ward and included two men, two boys, and four females. A decade later, his <a href="../../census1800.html#7904">household</a> consisted only of himself and three young girls as residents.  

<p>In May 1789, "Jamey Dunaway's wife" was buried from the Dutch church. He died in July 1802 and was <a href="../../dead.html">laid to rest</a> in the new municipal cemetery.</p>
