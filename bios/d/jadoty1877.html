<strong>Jane (Anne or Jane Anne) Doty</strong></a> was born about 1745. She <a href="../../res/ts.html">may</a> have been the daughter of Jabez and Mary Ann Price Doty. If so, her father was "of New York City" at the time of her birth. Then her brother, John Doty, would become rector of St. George's Anglican church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and later chaplain of a Loyalist regiment.

<p>During the summer of 1766, she married <a href="../b/aubostwick7380.html">Augustus Bostwick</a>. Their  marriage may have been childless or she could have been the mother of two sons. About that time, the new couple settled in Albany where Augustus  joined <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>These Bostwicks lived modestly in Albany until Augustus's death  prior to <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a> when "widow Bostwick" was listed as the owner on a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1877">1788</a>, her home and holdings were assigned small assessments. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1877">1790</a>, Jane was the head of a first ward household that included herself and one boy.

<p>In December 1791, she was identified as the niece and heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjoprice6447.html">will</a> of  <a href="../p/joprice6447.html">John Price</a>.  

<p>Jane Doty Bostwick  may have been alive as late as August 1815 and may have removed to Quebec at any time after 1790 - the last community-based reference to her in Albany.</p>
