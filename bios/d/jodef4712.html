<strong>Johannes De Foreest</strong></a> was born in September 1697. He was the son of Albany mainliners <a href="phdef4706.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../k/cakip5948.html">Tryntie Kip</a> De Foreest. He was a younger son in the large family of a placeman and cooper whose home was on the hill in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Philip De Foreest later moved out to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck and died in 1723.

<p>In 1715, the young man's name was listed on an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia roll</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1726">1726</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the first ward.

<p>In October 1725, Johannes married <a href="../q/maq2208.html">Maria Quackenbush</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1741, twelve children were christened in the church where both parents were members and regular baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4712">1742</a>, he was counted among the freeholders living in the first ward.

<p>In 1750, he was identified as a "brasier" of Albany and the husband of Maria who was named an heir to the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Aj8GAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:04N2YCEYfNTUxNcVtUa3zoC#PPA407,M1">estate</a> of Elbert Lieverse of New York City. So, that is the only reference encountered to his <a href="../../trades/metal.html">trade</a>.

<p>Johannes De Foreest died in June 1754 and was buried by his church. He had lived about fifty-seven years.</p>
