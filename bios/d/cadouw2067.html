<strong>Catherine Douw</strong></a> was born in March 1724. She was the daughter of <a href="pedouw2164.html">Petrus</a> and <a href="../vr/anvr5059.html">Anna Van Rensselaer</a> Douw. She grew up in the <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#douw">large family</a> of wealthy and prominent parents in comfortable homes in Albany and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. All nine of those children lived to reach adulthood including city father <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert P. Douw</a> - her older brother. However, their mother died in 1756.


<p>Even though she was the second eldest daughter, Catherine did not marry. At this point, we cannot say why not! Instead, she succeeded to her father's Albany property on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> following Petrus Douw's death in 1775. For the next three decades, she shared that home with her unmarried and much younger sister, <a href="radouw2168.html">Rachel</a>. Their names were featured on <a href="../../census1790.html#2067">cen</a>su<a href="../../census1800.html#2067">ses</a> and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">ass</a>ess<a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2067">ment</a> rolls. She also owned additional properties along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.  In 1790, their household was served by six slaves.

<p>By the outbreak of war in 1775, Albany was home to a  <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#whh">s</a>izeable population of <a href="../../or/or-bh.html">women-headed</a> households. <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#never">Never</a>-married spinsters, these Douw sisters were prime examples of one type of these early Albany homes. With a substantial and well-connected network of surviving siblings and their children, these single women were able to survive and live out their lives in the new Albany that emerged following the winning of independence and the end of the war. 

<p>Rachel Douw died suddenly in August 1806 leaving Catherine alone in her Court Street home. After a winter illness of two weeks, Catherine Douw died on January 1, 1811 - the last of her parents' large family. She had lived almost eighty-seven years. Her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in March.
