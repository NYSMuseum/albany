<strong>Pieter De Wandelaer</strong></a> was born in September 1713. He was the son of <a href="jodewan6168.html">Johannes De Wandelaer, Jr.</a> and his wife, <a href="../g/elgansevoort4704.html">Elizabeth Gansevoort</a> De Wandelaer. He grew up in a large family in a merchant's house on Market Street. His father also owned farmland at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/padewan.jpg" border=1 width=198 height=252 align=right vsapace=4 hspace=4 alt="Pau De Wandelaer"></a>


<p>His first wife was Ariaantie <a href="../vv/vvechten.html">Van Vechten</a>. She died following the birth of their second child in 1750. In March 1753, he married <a href="../b/anbogardus2387.html">Anna Bogardus</a> Van Vechten, a twenty-eight-year-old widow with a small child of her own. By 1763, his second marriage had produced three more children who also were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 


<p>Pieter De Wandelaer was a businessman and <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">landholder</a> who owned a number of <a href="../../census1756.html#319">buildings</a> and lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He also may have had a second home on a farm in the countryside.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1737">1737</a>, he was appointed constable for the third ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1743">1743</a>, he was named firemaster. And in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1752">1752</a> and 1753, he was elected assistant alderman. He was a contractor of the city and the city council occasionally met at his home. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6185">1763</a>, he was included on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, he contributed supplies for the American cause, was paid for services, and hosted a meeting of the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> at his house in November 1776.

<p>Pieter De Wandelaer's holdings were valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. He was last heard from when his account was paid by the Albany city government in September 1781. Also, a Pieter De Wandelaer witnessed a lease for Montgomery County farmland in November 1787.  </p>

The life of Pieter De Wandelaer is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6185. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.

<p><a name=portrait><b>Portrait:</b> Titled "Pau De Wandelaer," this is one of the best known of the Albany limner paintings. It has been attributed to Pieter Vanderlyn. Often reproduced, the original is in the <a href="../../res/fairuse.html">collection</a> of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany Institute of History and Art</a>. We are in good company in stating/hoping that it represents this Pieter De Wandelaer. However, evidence for so identifying the subject of this classic painting is inconclusive.
