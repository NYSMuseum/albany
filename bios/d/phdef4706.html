<P><a href="#sources"><b>Philip De Foreest</b></a> probably was born in New Amsterdam in 1652. He was the son of Isaac and Sara Truax De Foreest.


<p>In January 1676, he married <a href="../k/cakip5948.html">Tryntje Kip</a> in New York City. By 1703, nine of their children had been baptized in New York and Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch churches</a>. After a time in New York, the new couple relocated to Albany.</p>

<p>In 1680, he purchased a house and lot on the <a href="../../im/im1686.html">hill</A> in Albany from Nicholas De Meyer. That property would have been above (west of) <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. In 1688, he was appointed constable in the first ward. The next year, he was appointed high constable. He also served as a juror and street sweeper.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#137">1697</a>, his Albany home was enumerated on the city census. Two years later, he signed an <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4706">oath of allegiance</a> to the King of England. Assessment <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4706">rolls</a> for the early 1700s showed his first ward property to be of moderate value. He also was identified as a cooper.</p>


<p>In 1720, his name appeared among the freeholders of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html#census">Rensselaerswyck</a>. But that same year, his Albany house was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willelizteller.html">will</a> of a neighbor. Philip De Foreest died in July 1723 at age seventy. His widow survived until 1731.</p>
