      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Volkert A. Douw</strong></a> was born in 
        December 1733. He was the son of <a href="abdouw2052.html">Abraham</a> 
        and <a href="../w/cawinne2826.html">Lyntie Winne</a> Douw. His mother 
        died in November 1749 and his father later remarried. He grew up in the 
        third ward home of an Albany mainstay who survived into the late 1780s. 
      <p>In 1757, he was provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne3032.html">will</a> 
        of his uncle. This individual was known as "Volkert A. Douw" to prevent 
        confusion with a number of contemporary kin including the <a href="vopdouw2234.html">one-time 
        mayor</a> of Albany. Assignment of qualitative information on the long 
        life of this individual is further complicated by the existence of a number 
        of "Volkert A. Douws" living at the same time. 
      <p>In November 1757, he married Albany native <a href="../w/anwendell2751.html">Anna 
        Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A 
        son was christened there the following September. Anna may have died as 
        Volkert A. received <a href="http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/DOW/2005-09/1127313774">licenses</a> 
        to wed Elizabeth Dennison in October 1759 and then Mary Codwise on June 
        28, 1762. His daughter with Mary was born the following June. He was a 
        supporter of the Albany church. He may have re-married and fathered still 
        more children. 
      <p>He <a href="http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:ouSynzjyw0IJ:www.hartgen.com/userfiles/DiVirgilio%2520New%2520York%2520History%2520Fall%25202005.pdf+%22volckert+a.+douw%22&cd=4&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">may 
        have been</a> a partner in a <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> 
        rum distillery constructed as early as 1758. 
      <p>Beginning in 1758, he served as a judge in Albany County. First in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>, 
        he was appointed firemaster for the third and second wards. He later served 
        as an inspector and had substantial contracts with the city government 
        as well. 
      <p>Beginning during the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, 
        his third and second ward properties were accorded substantial <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2235">assessments</a>. 
      <p>In July 1775, he was <a href="http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:BYYLu2q_dpgJ:archive.lib.msu.edu/MMM/JA/09/a/JA09a001p003.pdf+%22volkert+a.+douw%22&cd=9&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">identified</a> 
        as an <a   href="../../furtrade.html">Indian trader</a> of the city of 
        Albany when his his father named him attorney with the power to sell shares 
        of two slaves at Michilimackinac. 
      <p>In August 1778, a Quartermasts Department <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2235">roster</a> 
        identified him as the storekeeper at/for Coeymans. two occasions in <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924021474782/cu31924021474782_djvu.txt">1781</a>, 
        he was identified as a "gentleman" and permitted to post bail by the <a href="../../cddc.html">Albany 
        commissioners</a>. Wartime records, <a href="http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/amarch/getdoc.pl?/var/lib/philologic/databases/amarch/.7880">listed</a> 
        him as adjutant of the first regiment of the Albany militia. Afterwards, 
        he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2235">land bounty 
        right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment. 
      <p>In April <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#2235">1788</a>, he was among 
        those Albany antifederalists who signed a set of objections to the proposed 
        Federal constitution. 
      <p>Post-war assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2235">rolls</a> 
        valued his house and property. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2235">1790</a>, 
        his household was configured on the third ward census and included four 
        slaves. Subsequent community <a href="../../census1800.html#2235">surveys</a> 
        described his household and holdings in the second ward. 
      <p>In 1808, he was among those invited to the <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#2235">funeral</a> 
        of an Albany neighbor. 
      <p>Volkert A. Douw died somewhat afterwards but probably before 1810. </p>
