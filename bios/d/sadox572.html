<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Dox</strong></a> is <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/h/o/Will-Shortt/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0614.html">said</a> to have been born in 1679 and to have been a native of Long Island. Thus, he would have been the son of Thomas and Sarah Bushell <a href="../../res/sp.html">Doxie</a>. They were Connecticut natives and his father is <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/DOXSIE/1999-06/0930018799">said</a> to have died in Barbadoes in 1688.

<p>In September 1699, Samuel <a href="../../res/sp.html">Doxie</a> married Barber Jans at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, he was living in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. By the end of 1706, four children had been christened in Albany. Barber died shortly thereafter. By May 1708, Samuel was called the "widower of Barber Jans" when he married Lysbeth Bas also in Albany. By 1729, seven more children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#572">1709</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> property was accorded a modest assessment..  
<p>In March 1711, he petitioned the Albany government to appoint him as a licensed <a href="../../econ/trans.html#overland">carter</a>.
 	   
<p>In 1720, Samuel Doxie was a freeholder in <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>.

<p>The christening of his last child at the Albany church in June 1729 represents the latest reference encountered thus far.</p>

Much of his story has escaped our sweep at this time.</div>
