<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jesse De Foreest</b></a> was born in 1692. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="phdef4706.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../k/cakip5948.html">Tryntie Kip</a> De Foreest.

<p>In August 1718, he married <a href="../q/coq2035.html">Neeltie Quackenbush</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740, the marriage had produced nine children who were christened in the Albany church where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These De Foreests lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> from where he was elected assistant alderman three times in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1734">1734</a>, 1735, and 1749. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4711">1742</a>, he was identified as a freeholder in the third ward. On several occasions, he was compensated by the city <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a> for road repair and other services. Previously, he had served as firemaster and was a member of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.
 
<p>Jesse De Foreest died on September 26, 1756 at age sixty-four. His death and other family information was recorded in his bible now available <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible16.htm">online</a>!</p>
