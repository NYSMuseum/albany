<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob D'Hinsse</b></a> (De Hinse) was a <a href="../../trades/medical.html">surgeon</a> who lived in Beverwyck <a href="../../timeline.html"><b>-</b></a> Albany and <a href="http://www.accessible.com/amcnty/DE/Delaware/delaware43.htm">other locations</a> in New Netherland.</p>

<p>In 1661, a legal document identified him as "Mr. Jacob de Hinsse, chirurgeon in the village of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> near Fort Orange." He owned several parcels in Albany [along the river and the Ruttenkill], served as magistrate, and also appeared in court as a litigant and attorney. <a href="../../sources.html#cma">Court minutes</a> describe some of the particulars of his medical practice.</p>

<p>His practice appears to have been extensive and among his principal clients were the Deacons of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>During the 1650s and/or '60s, he contracted with an orphanage in the Netherlands for the services of a maid. Her work in his Beverwyck household was noted by D'Hinsse's biographer.</p>

<p>His first wife was Anna [Hendrix Van Rensselaer]. Seven weeks after her death in March 1671, D'Hinsse married widow Rykie Van Dyck Dareth, the sister of his one-time apprentice, <a href="../vd/cvdyck821.html">Dr. Cornelis Van Dyck</a>. </p>

<p>Jacob D'Hinsse died in August 1671 "being conscious till the last minute and in a peaceful frame of mind." Without other surviving heirs, the entire estate went to his widow.</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Jacob D'Hinsse is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 8011. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The only historian to attempt to chronicle his life is Janny Venema. She found him often referred to as "Meester Jakob." Her book entitled <a href="../../books.html#jv"><i>Beverwijck</i></a> also includes a section on medical care in Beverwyck.
<br><dd>As with many figures of the New Netherland era, we have many unanswered questions regarding D'Hinsse's life!</p>
