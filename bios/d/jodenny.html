<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled varoiously, the individual we refer to as <a href="#sources">
<strong>John Denny (the younger)</strong></a> to help prevent confusion with an older Albany resident also named <a href="jodenny3932.html">John Denny</a> was born during the 1770s.

<p>He married Hannah Sturges at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church in December 1801. At that time, both were identified as of the "city of Albany."

<p>In 1810, three John Denny's were listed on the Albany census. <a href="jodenny3932.html">One</a> of them was considerably older than this individual. 

<p>We believe that this individual was listed in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> - beginning in 1814. He was identified as a "dryer and silk-dresser" at various addresses on <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a> and then "near" the corner of Hudson <a href="../../loc/southside.html">and</a> Green. He was last noted in the directory in 1820.

<p>John Denny (the younger) was dead by 1821 when his widow began to be listed on the city directory at Hudson and Green address.</p>
