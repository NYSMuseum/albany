<P>According to later legal <a href="../../or/pension/penjoshaw.html">papers</a>, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Isabella Denniston</strong></a> would have been born about 1764. She was a daughter in the large family of <a href="hdenniston5136.html">Hugh</a> and <a href="../vv/ravvlk1401.html">Rachel Van Valkenburgh</a> Denniston. She grew up in an innkeeper's home in Albany and also in its <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">en</a>virons.

<p>In September 1783, she married former Revolutionary army officer <a href="../s/joshaw.html">John Shaw</a> at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. The marriage seems to have produced a large family.

<p>In 1785, she was among the heir noted in the <a href="../../wills/willhdenniston.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>These Shaws made their <a href="../../census1790.html#josh">home</a> near the waterfront and in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany. Like his father, John Shaw was a ropemaker and innkeeper. Isabella's father was their business partner.

<p>On a number of occasions, Isabella was named in <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transactions along with her husband involving lots in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet.  



<p>John Shaw's pension application for service to the American <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">cause</a> was filed in April 1825. It described his family living with him as including his wife Isabella (then about sixty-one and "feeble and infirm") and six children ranging from twenty-eight to nine. Veteran John Shaw died in July 1826 at the age of sixty-six.

<p>However, Isabella Denniston Shaw managed to live in their 67 <a href="../../streets.html#market">North Market Street</a> home for more than another decade. She died in March 1838. She would have been about seventy-four-years-old.  Her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in October.</p>
