<P>Spelled <a href="../../res/sp.html">and</a> referenced variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Dockstader</strong></a> was listed (spelled "Doxtrader") on the Albany census as the head of a household in <a href="../../census1800.html#jado">1800</a>. That principal would have been born between 1756 and 1774, In 1800, that second ward household also included four young girls and a woman about his age.   A year later, the Albany government <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">noted</a> that he was a tavern owner who was to pay $12 for a license. Beyond that, little of note has been recovered in the <a href="../../cbr.html">comm</a>unity-based record while the <a href="../../res/sp.html">surname</a> is widely referenced following <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=ZaJPWuv1FomEmwGTg7GADQ&q=dockstader+albany&oq=dockstader+albany&gs_l=psy-ab.3...7997.7997.0.10562.1.1.0.0.0.0.80.80.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.4-gcyrDpMpQ">sweeps</a> of Internet-based resources.  We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YJQvAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA48&lpg=RA12-PA48&dq=%22jacob+dockstader%22+albany&source=bl&ots=qGH78-f_Lr&sig=q4CJb82ZI29wjzM8UjNkuCSVync&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj5f75yr7YAhVDNiYKHShSCd0Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&q=%22jacob%20dockstader%22%20albany&f=false">1797</a>, "Jacob Dockstader" was selling "Webster's Almanac" at "his printing office, Johnstown." During those years, he published a <a href="http://www.fulton.nygenweb.net/history/glovshistoryE.html">newspaper</a> and also <a href="https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3384160">printed</a> books. At this point, we cannot connect this individual to the Albany resident of 1800.


<p><a href="https://gw.geneanet.org/tdowling?lang=en&p=jacob&n=dockstader">Internet</a>-based and other <a href="../../res/ts.html">trad</a>itional resources tell us that "Jacob Dockstader" was born about 1755. Thus, he would have been the son of Henry and Sarah - perhaps descendants of Palatine <a href="../ger.html">Germans</a> living in the Mohawk Valley. However, <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/dockstader/80/">another family line</a> under that general name appears to have an Oneida lineage. This sketch seeks to provide demographics for the <a href="../../census1800.html#jado">Jacob Dockstader</a> noted on the Albany census in 1800.

<p>"Jacob's" wife was named Lea and they produced at least one son born in 1787 but not found in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p><a href="../qqqq.html#one">One</a> Jacob Dockstader was among those who <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=uReLy9BjUDIC&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=%22jacob+dockstader%22+albany&source=bl&ots=tvOCFJraFo&sig=lRuql1PX1tu9EI5RS4da9J4R2rk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj5f75yr7YAhVDNiYKHShSCd0Q6AEIPTAG#v=onepage&q=%22jacob%20dockstader%22%20albany&f=false">witnessed</a> a (land sale) treaty with the Oneida people signed in Albany in March 1815. In 1804, probably that person had been identified as "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9GQ4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=jacob+dockstader+an+oneida+indian&source=bl&ots=BCGYelAFJ0&sig=1i66LHAD36vRC2wSh_TR2wGFXks&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj41-mu0b7YAhWIRSYKHW3aC-oQ6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&q=jacob%20dockstader%20an%20oneida%20indian&f=false">an Oneida Indian</a>" in New York State documents. At this point, we cannot say whether his forebears were German or <a href="../indians.html">Nat</a>ive American.


<p>Jacob Dockstader is said to have died in Oneida County in March 1832. He had lived about 77 years.

<p>At this point, we are certain <a href="../../res/guess.html">only</a> that a number of similarly named individuals were living prominently in upstate New York. With so many spelling possibilities for individuals with diverse life stories, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">pause</a> for a while to seek preliminary clarity for the story of sometime Albany resident Jacob Dockstader.  </p>
