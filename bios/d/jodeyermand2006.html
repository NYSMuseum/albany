<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Deyermand</b></a> was born in March 1784.

<p>He was in Albany by July 1812 when he was <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc15213.htm">mentioned</a> in the conveyance of several parcels of land in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Colonie</a>. In 1813, he was identified in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as a grocer and living at 59 Orange Street. His house was on the corner of Orange and Chapel Streets. Subsequent directories listed him at that location thru 1821. </p>


<p>He was married to a woman named Mary Ann (born March 1787). In 1820, his household consisted of five people including two children under the age of ten. A <a href="#sampler">sampler</a> stitched by his daughter in 1822 provides demographic information on this family.</p>

<p>John Deyermand died in June 1821 at age thirty-seven. His will passed probate on June 13, 1821. HIs widow was listed in the city directory for 1822 at his former address. Her funeral was recorded in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> on March 14, 1828. </p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of John Deyermand/Dey-Ermand/D'Armond is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 2006.  His <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> occurs in many variations. This <a href="../../res/bios.html#sketch">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. <a name=sampler> A "sampler" was offered for sale at an action held at <a href="http://www.stairgalleries.com/">Stair Galleries</a> in Hudson, New York in April 2008. Transcription provided by a benefactor. An image of the sampler is on <a href="../../res/inq.html">file</a> at the project office. We seek defining information on his origins and activities. Three Deyermand households were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in 1815 and living in close proximity. At this point, material on the Internet raises questions!</p>
