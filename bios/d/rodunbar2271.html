<a href="#sources">K</a>nown as "Robert Dunbar, Jr., agent of the Patroon," this 
<strong>Robert Dunbar</strong> probably was born in June 1772. He was the son of <a href="ledunbar2262.html">Levinus</a> and Margarita Hansen Dunbar. He grew up in a mid-sized family in a modest home in Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a>..

<p>Perhaps he married Albany native <a href="../g/algrav.html">Alida Graverat</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in May 1796. The marriage produced a number of children.

<p>In May 1797, he <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/pr/sc10431.pdf">purchased</a> a share of the legendary sloop <i>The Experiment</i>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, his household was configured on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census showed the newlyweds (under Robert Dunbar, Jr.) living with an older couple and two slaves.

<p>In 1808, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PcM1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1001&lpg=PA1001&dq">appointed</a> adjutant in the Albany County militia. In 1832, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PcM1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1001&lpg=PA1001&dq#PPA1832,M1">promoted</a> to lieutenant colonel. Later, he would be known as "General."

<p>In August 1802, he paid for the burial of his <a href="../g/hegrav8237.html">father-in-law</a> from the Dutch church.
<p>In January 1808, he was among those <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#2271">invited</a> to the funeral of Henry J. Bleecker.

<p>In January 1810, "Robert Dunbar Junr. Esq." <a href="http://www.mudd.org/gen/pages/gedtohtml/wc_src/src005.htm">paid</a> chairmaker James Chestney for six "Common Chairs." 

<p>He was said to have been the principal agent of the Patroon for over thirty years and thus a resident of the part of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> then called <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> and now Colonie. He <a href="http://www.livingplaces.com/NY/Albany_County/Colonie_Town/Casparus_F_Pruyn_House.html">may have built</a> the so-called "Pruyn House," the headquarters of Dunbar's niece's husband and successor, <a href="../p/cafpruyn.html">Casparus F. Pruyn</a> - who reputedly got his start in Dunbar's office at age thirteen..

<p>In 1825, he was among the area worthies who made a large pledge to endow a <a href="../../doc/sl1825drc.html">third professorship</a> at what was then the "<a href="http://www.nbts.edu/newsite/">T</a>heological College of New Brunswick.

<p>He resigned (retired) from the patroonship in 1835 and was succeeded by Pruyn.

<p>"General Robert Dunbar, Jr." died in June 1837 at the age of sixty four. His newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=%22robert+dunbar,+jr.%22&source=web&ots=stiZdC4bPl&sig=-PAcSeoC2VZBi2E0E6b75Pgo1UA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result">obituary stated</a> that "He had been for more than thirty years the principal agent of the patroon and enjoyed the confidence and esteem of all who knew him." His patron, Stephen Van Rensselaer, died in 1839. Robert Dunbar's widow, Alida, died in April 1840.</p>
