<P>In <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo2">1800</a>, the households of <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo1">two</a> similarly named individuals were configured on the Albany city census. This         sketch organizes information on the life of <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Dougherty</strong></a>, a resident of the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. This character is not the Albany contemporary known as <a href="jodoty.html">John Doty</a>. 

<p>From the <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo2">census</a> we surmise that Dougherty had been born between 1756 and 1774. Living in his household was a women in his age bracket and a boy and girl each aged 10-16. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. We're guessing that he was of <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> background.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property only was valued modestly on the second ward assessment roll. He probably resided in a house (perhaps owned by one Joseph Walsh) on <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Barrack Street</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo2">1800</a>, Dougherty's second ward household (in the same location) included a boy and a girl, a man over the age of 45, and a woman between the ages of 26 and 45. No other information was given and that was the sole reference to that household on any Albany social <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">survey</a>.

<P>In November 1799, he was among those "trustees and principal members" of <a href="../../org/stmarys.html">St. Mary's</a> Catholic Church signing a <a href="../../org/stmarys.html#test">letter</a> to Bishop Carroll praising the late pastor, Rev. O'Brien.

<p>We recognize that this offering on the life of this Albany resident <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously referred to as John Dougherty is <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">premature.</a></p>

<div class="smalltext"> <A href="../../criteria.html"> <IMG align=left alt="the people of colonial Albany" border=1 width=30 height=30 hspace=4   src="../../images/jpg/logoicon.jpg" vspace=4></A> <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of John Dougherty (of the second ward) has no CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>.

<p><b>Research notes</b>: At this point, we have <a href="../../res/guess.html">sought</a> to develop the profile of the John Dougherty who lived in the second ward in 1800. We have not opened an exposition on the same-named <a href="../../census1800.html#jodo1">individual</a> living in the first ward at that time.
 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; In <a href="https://archive.org/stream/calendarofnycolo00alba#page/443/mode/2up">April 1767</a>, a John Dougherty and six others began the process of petitioning the provincial government for land located along the west bank of the Connecticut River. Perhaps our subject was a next-generation kin.
