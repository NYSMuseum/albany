          <P><A href="#biography"><B>John De Peyster Douw</B></A> was born in 
            January 1756. He was the eighth of the nine children born to <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert 
            P.</a> and <a href="adp7822.html">Anna De Peyster</a> Douw. His early 
            years were spent in the heart of the Albany business district and 
            then at the <a href="vopdouw2234.html#wolvenhook">family farm</a> 
            across the Hudson. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jdpdouw.jpg" width=200 hspace=4 vspace=4 align=left border=1 alt="John De Peyster Douw"></a>His 
            father served as <a href="../../mayors.html#rs">mayor</a> of Albany 
            during the 1760s. His <a href="jodp.html">maternal grandfather</a>, 
            <a href="#name">namesake</a>, and benefactor had been mayor a generation 
            earlier.</P>
<p>He was sent to Yale from where he is said to have graduated in 1777.


<P>Groomed to enter business under the experienced eye of his aged grandfather, John came of age himself at the onset of the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. Already serving as an ensign in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> company of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>, he used his business experience in the commissary department of the Continental army. He took part in the Clinton-Sullivan expedition against the Indians in 1779.

<P>In 1782, he was appointed Albany County Surrogate. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1788">1788</a>, he was elected alderman for the first ward. After living as a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2143">boarder</a> (perhaps in the second ward home of mayor <a href="../b/jojabeekman3866.html">John J. Beeckman</a>), he established a <a href="../../census1790.html#2143">permanent residence</a> in the State Street townhouse he had inherited from his uncle's estate in 1787.

<p>John De Peyster Douw married three times. First, in 1787, to Deborah Beekman - daughter of another Albany mayor. After her death, he wed Margaret Livingston of Dutchess  County in 1795. The two marriages produced four children before Margaret's death in 1802. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2143">1800</a>, his household included seven member and four slaves.  In 1811, he married a much younger <a href="../g/cagansevoort4682.html">Catherine Gansevoort</a> - who bore four children. He was a member and officer of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>Trained as a lawyer, he was more defined as a merchant whose store was located on what became <a href="../../streets.html#court">South Market Street</a>. He served on a number of boards of directors and bought and sold a significant number of pieces of Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>.

<p>This "gentleman of the old school" died in August 1835 at the age of seventy-nine.</p>
