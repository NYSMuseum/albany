      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes De Garmo</strong></a> was born 
        in April 1694. He was a middle child in the large family of <a href="pdegarmo947.html">Pierre</a> 
        and <a href="../vd/cavdh5675.html">Caatje Vanderheyden</a> De Garmo. He 
        grew up in a fur trader's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In October 1719, he married Albany native <a href="../v/egvisscher4111.html">Egbertie 
        Visscher</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1726, four children had been christened in Albany where he was a frequent 
        baptism sponsor. 
      <p>This De Garmo family also lived in the third ward on what became <a href="../../streets.html#steuben">Steuben 
        Street</a> where Johannes was an Albany mainstay for more than forty years. 
        He also bought and sold lots along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1718">1718</a>, he was appointed constable 
        in the third ward. In 1719, he was named high constable. In 1737, he was 
        appointed firemaster for the second ward. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, he was a member of 
        an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#814">1720</a> 
        and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#814">1742</a>, his name appeared 
        on lists of Albany freeholders. In <a href="../../census1756.html#33">1756</a>, 
        he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> 
        and an Albany householder. 
      <p>Except for witnessing a <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3859.html">will</a> 
        in 1731 and in <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus.html">1756</a>, his 
        name thus far is otherwise missing from the community record. 
      <p>Johannes De Garmo died in 1764 and was buried by his wife in the church 
        in June. He had just passed his seventieth birthday. </p>
