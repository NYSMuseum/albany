      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Robert Dunbar</b></a> was born in November 1709. 
        He was the son of innkeeper <a href="jodunbar2258.html">John Dunbar</a> 
        and his first wife <a href="../w/bawinne2819.html">Bata Winne</a> Dunbar. 
        Following Bata's death and John Dunbar's second marriage in 1724, he seems 
        to have re-located to Schenectady.</p>
      <p>In October 1732, he (R. <a href="../../res/sp.html">Tumbarr</a>) married 
        Albany native <a href="../s/cospoor6526.html">Cornelia Spoor</a> at the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1744, six children 
        had been baptized in Albany.</p>
      <p>Robert Dunbar's child was buried from the Dutch church in March 1737. 
        His name seems to have dropped from Albany rolls following the baptism 
        of his son in 1744. Unlike his other brothers and sisters, Robert was 
        not named in the <a href="../../wills/willjodunbar2258.html">will</a> 
        of his father filed in 1736. This omission is of <a href="../qqqq.html">grave 
        concern</a> in the development of Robert Dunbar's life profile. 
      <p>However, "captured at Albany", a Robert Dunbar was among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8BETAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22robert+dunbar%22+albany&source=web&ots=XgC9ycMyem&sig=UGzDq2-F1i0y8brwVnPrA8HNb9Q&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result">incarcerated</a> 
        at Quebec in 1746 who escaped confinement in October are were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NEz0pw3JotIC&pg=PA433&lpg=PA433&dq=%22robert+dunbar%22+albany&source=web&ots=dgdtLZT0BU&sig=a8nKvQnRB3_al2JbPEZECzkd3ws&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPA433,M1">believed</a> 
        to have drowned crossing Lake Champlain. 
      <p>Perhaps, his widow was the "Cornelia Dun Barr" whose Albany property 
        was valued along with her son Levinus Dunbar during the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">mid-1760s</a>. 
      <p>At this point, we have no reason to believe that Robert had followed 
        his father in the hospitality business. As his name is conspicuously missing 
        from the Albany-based record except for the family information noted above, 
        perhaps his livelihood lay <a href="../../furtrade.html">bey</a>ond the 
        settlements of his ancestors. With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> 
        regarding his life and passing, we move on <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">for</a> 
        now.
