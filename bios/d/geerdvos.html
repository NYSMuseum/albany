<P><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that <a href="#sources"> <strong>Geertruy De Vos</strong></a> was born during the first half of the seventeenth century (perhaps in 1631 or 1632). She was the daughter of <a href="anddvos.html">Andries De Vos</a> and his wife, Margarita or Maria Coeymans De Vos. She is thought to have come to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> with her parents in 1641. She grew up on her father's farm in the part of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> that today is known as <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> - although Andries De Vos owned property within the <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> stockade as well.

<p>Perhaps she was the second wife of <a href="../c/bacoey6155.html">Barent Pieterse Coeymans</a>. Traditional sources have given her marriage date as 1653. Subsequently, Geertruy bore several Coeymans children and is considered to be the matriarch of the <a href="../c/coeymans.html">Coeymans family</a> in America.

<p>Barent Pieterse accumulated substantial and diverse resources in the area around <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>/Albany - although he probably was <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> an actual city resident. He may have lived into the eighteenth century as his estate was not <a href="../c/andcoey.html#letters">probated</a> until 1712.

<p>However, Geertruy De Vos Coeymans died somewhat earlier. In <a href="../../census1697.html#6155">1697</a>, the census of Barent Pieterse's <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck family showed no women in his household. Traditional sources may have set her death date as 1671 and also as 1688.</p>
