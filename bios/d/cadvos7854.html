<strong>Catharina De Vos</strong></a> probably was born in Holland before 1630. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers Andries and Margarita Coeymans De Vos. They may have emigrated to New Netherland in 1641.

<p>She appears to have married three times. Her first marriage to <a href="../b/aranbradt4181.html">Arent Andriesse Bradt</a> produced six children. In 1664, she married Barent Janse Van Ditmars who was killed in the raid on <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> in February 1690. In 1691, she married <a href="../vb/cjvbock6521.html">Claas Janse Van Bockhoven</a>.

<p>Catharina and all of her husbands were <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/09.html">involved</a> in the founding and establishment of Schenectady. She may have been a Schenectady resident regardless of her marital state. In <a href="../../census1697.html#152">1697</a>, her third husband was living in Albany without a woman in his household. 

<p>In January 1699, her husband filed a <a href="../../wills/willcjvbock.html">will</a> that provided for Catharina's children.

<p>In 1709, her name appeared on a Schenectady assessment roll. She had been a property holder there for many years.

<p>Catharina De Vos is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have died in Schenectady in 1712.</p>
