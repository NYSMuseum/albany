<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Magdalena Douw Gansevoort is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 90. This profile is derived chiefly from 
<a href="douw.html#sources">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. An article related to her story entitled "The Albany of Magdalena Douw," by has been printed in the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/WP/home.html"><i>Winterthur Portfolio</i></a>, volume 4 (1968). </p>

<p><a name=portrait><B>Portrait</b> done about 1740 by limner <a href="../h/joheaton.html">John Heaton</a> is in the collection of the <a href="http://www.winterthur.org/about/collections.asp">Winterthur Museum</a>. Fortunately, this colorful painting has appeared in print a number of times. Although it perpetuates an almost doll-like stereotype of "colonial Dutch" women, its attractiveness never fails to delight program participants - young and old alike!
