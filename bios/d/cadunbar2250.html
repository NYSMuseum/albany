<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Catharina Dunbar</strong></a> was born in November 1770. She was the daughter of <a href="wmdunbar2275.html">William</a> and Elizabeth Van Deusen Dunbar. She grew up as part of a mid-sized family in the <a href="../../streets.html#tromp">Van Tromp Street</a> home of an Albany mainstay.


<p>In February 1791, she married her <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> neighbor <a href="../w/jawynkoop6955.html">James Wynkoop</a> at the Albany <a href=../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1811, the marriage had produced at least five children.


<p>These Wynkoops made their home nearby on <a href="../../streets.html#market">North Market Street</a> where James was a prominent grocer and merchant. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6955">1800</a>, they were raising their children in the home of his recently deceased father. James and Catharina Wynkoop would remain Market Street mainliners for several decades.

<p>Catharina lost her husband in 1821. Beginning in that year, she was identified in the <a href="../../sources.html">city directory</a> as the head of her South Market Street household. In 1830, the sixty-year-old "widow of James" had moved to a smaller residence located near the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>. Catharina Dunbar Wynkoop <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dJwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA198&lpg=PA198&dq=%22cathalina+wynkoop%22&source=bl&ots=SAs1QRV6H5&sig=Te7Ili3XHN4YVAmfapeXWn3GYn4&hl=en&ei=gJ7MSvaFN8PblAe5k9TSBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2#v=onepage&q=%22cathalina%20wynkoop%22&f=false">survived</a> until June 1838. Eventually, her stone came to <a href="../../dead.html">rest</a> in the Albany Rural Cemetery.
