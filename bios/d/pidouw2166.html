<strong>Pietertje Douw</strong></a> was born in August 1702. She was the daughter of <a href="hedouw2083.html">Hendrick</a> and the widow <a href="../vi/comvi2340.html">Neeltie Van Iveren</a> Van Bergen Douw. She grew up in a large combined family in a number of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> locations.

<p>In February 1732, she was almost thirty when she married <a href="../h/wmhogan4397.html">William Hogan, Jr.</a> at the Catskill Dutch church. By 1748. By 1748, the marriage had produced at least four children.

<p>In 1749, she was left sixty pounds and a negro woman in the <a href="../../wills/willhedouw.html">will</a> of her father. In 1775, she was <a href="../../sources.html#cc">identified</a> as the owner of a slave named "Tom."

<p>Although we may have this "Hogan wife" confused with other people, we believe that she was a widow by the early 1760s and that she was listed as the head of a first ward household on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> during the 1760s, 70s, and <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2166">80s</a>. After that, she probably <a href="../../census1790.html#4317">lived</a> with her son <a href="../h/hehogan4317.html">Henry Hogan</a>. 

<p>If so, then Pietertje Douw Hogan probably was the "Widow Hogan" buried in the Albany Dutch church on November 1, 1794.</p>
