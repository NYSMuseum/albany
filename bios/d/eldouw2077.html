<strong>Elizabeth Douw</strong></a> was born in December 1733. She was a younger daughter in the <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#douw">large</a> family of <a href="pedouw2164.html">Petrus</a> and <a href="../vr/anvr5059.html">Anna Van Rensselaer</a> Douw. Elizabeth grew up in the family homes in Albany and across the Hudson at the country seat built by her father called "<a href="douw.html#wol">Wolvenhook</a>." 


<p>In January 1764, she was identified as a "spinster" when became the thirty-one-year-old bride of widower <a href="../b/jombeekman3863.html">Johannes M. Beekman</a>. At that time, her <a href="vopdouw2234.html">brother</a> was the mayor of Albany. By 1775, the marriage had produced four children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Beekmans raised their family in a comfortable house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Johannes was a prominent businessman and civic leader.



<p>Johannes M. Beekman filed a <a href="../../wills/willjombeekman3863.html">will</a> in December 1787. It named  Elizabeth and two sons as heirs and Elizabeth as co-executor of his substantial estate. The will did not pass probate until July 1799. However, she was a widow by <a href="../../census1790.html#2077">1790</a>, when the third ward census listed her as the head of the household. That home was attended by five slaves.
  
<p>With the help of her servants and her son, she remained the <a href="../../census1800.html#2077">head</a> of her household until she was in her nineties. Elizabeth Douw Beekman died in December 1811 at the age of ninety-eight.</p>
