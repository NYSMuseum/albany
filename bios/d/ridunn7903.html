<strong>Richard Dunn</strong></a> was born about 1744. Perhaps he was the Richard Dunn whose household was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> census for Caughnawaga in Montgomery County. That household contained seven people.


<p>We seek information on when he settled in Albany. His wife was Albany native <a href="../b/nabarret7231.html">Nancy Barret</a>. In 1788, three of their children were alive and were mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> of his brother-in-law - an Albany cooper. 

<p>In December 1796, he was appointed superintendent of the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> watchmen. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his<a href="../../wards.html#1"> first ward</a> house and lot were listed on the Albany assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7903">1800</a>  and in 1810, the census showed that his household included three children and two adults. 

<p>In 1800 and 1801 he paid nine dollars for a grocer's license. In 1803, he was identified as a merchant and a freeholder. Beginning in 1813, "Richard Dunn and Son" were listed as merchants in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 16 <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> and at its successor, 462 South Market Street. <a href="../../cbr.html">C</a>ommunity-based accounts from the early 1800s further <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc16906.htm">articulate</a> his business.

<p>Richard Dunn buried his twenty-nine-year-old son in 1815. He died in October 1825 and was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/StPetEpChCemA-F.htm">buried</a> in the <a href="../../stpeters.html">Ep</a>iscopal cemetery following a funeral from his South Market Street residence. He had lived eighty-one years. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate a few days later. His second wife, Margaret, died in December 1831 at the age of ninety-five.</p>
