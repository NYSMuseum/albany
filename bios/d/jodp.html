<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Johannes De Peyster</B></A> was born in New York in 1694. He was the son of <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a>-ancestry businessman <a href="#jdp">Johannes De Peyster</a> and his wife, Albany native <a href="../b/anbancker6457.html">Anna Bancker</a> De Peyster. His long tenure in Albany represents a prime blueprint for <a href="../../econ/comec.html">success</a> in early America.</P>

          <P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jodepeyster.jpg" align=right width=175 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Johannes De Peyster"></a>With the coming of <a href="../../peace.html">peace in 1713</a>, a young 
            Johannes was sent upriver to learn business with his uncle, Albany 
            magnate <a href="../b/ebancker6454.html">Evert Bancker</a>. Just 
            past his twentieth birthday, in 1715 he married Albany-born <a href="../s/anschuyler932.html">Anna 
            Schuyler</a>, an eighteen-year-old daughter of Albany's <a href="../s/phpischuyler.html">most 
            prominent</a> New Netherland family. They may have had eight children 
            - but only two of the &nbsp; last four born after 1722 survived to 
            adulthood.</P>

<p>Succeeding Evert Bancker on the Albany-to-New York end of his business, Johannes De Peyster settled into his uncle's house on the south side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> - where he lived for the next seventy years. He also succeeded Bancker in Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">public life</a> as he was elected a <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> assistant in 1721. The next year, he was elected alderman and then annually re-elected until he was appointed recorder of the city in 1726. He was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor of Albany</a> in 1729 and served until 1733. He later was elected again as an alderman from 1748 to 1754.</p>

<p>Active in a broad range of public activities, he was a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia officer</a> from 1717 to the 1740s when he still captained a troop of horse. He frequently had contract business with city hall and was an active member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a> until he resigned in protest in 1746. He was a pewholder in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He also was a partner in a number of frontier patents.</p>

<p>Anna Schuyler De Peyster died in 1750 - leaving her husband to administer the estate of her late father. Without sons, Johannes looked to a <a href="gedp7827.html">nephew</a> and <a href="#sonsinlaw">two able sons-in-law</a> for support in his personal business. Over the next two decades, he remained one of the most prominent <a href="../../census1756.html#84">Albany merchants</a> with a net worth among Albany's highest during the late <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>.</p>

          <p>During the <a href="../../7yw.html">last colonial war</a>, he was the paymaster of 
            New York forces, inspector of ordnance, and supplier of Oswego. He 
            served as the first <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> 
            Surrogate from 1756 to 1766. He held the position again under New 
            York State from 1778 to 1782 when he was replaced by his grandson, 
            <a href="jdpdouw.html">John De Peyster Douw</a>.
			
<p>As late as <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jodp">1779</a>, his State Street holdings were still valued substantially.</p>
   
<p>With the coming of peace in 1783, Johannes De Peyster was approaching his ninetieth birthday. He could look back on a varied and distinguished career in Albany that spanned seven decades. He died on February 27, 1789. He was ninety-five years old!</p>
