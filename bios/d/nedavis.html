<P>The mysterious <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ned Davis</strong></a> lived in Albany during the last quarter of the eigthteenth century. At this point, we suspect that his life is distinct from that of the older Albany resident <a href="eddav7766.html">Edward Davis</a>. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Based on circumstantial informaton and on the following association, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">believe</a> he was an <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro Albanian</a>.  

 <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2551">1788</a>, the second ward assessment roll valued the holdings of Ned Davis and <a href="../p/wmpepper2551.html">William Pepper</a> individually. Assessed separately on the next line was the notation "house they live in." In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, a modest house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> belonged to an individual who was described as "Edward Davis (negro)." 
 
<p>After that, his name has not been found during our search of community-based <a href="../../cbr.html">res</a>ources nor have we yet encountered him in our ongoing sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a>-based resources.

<p>Based on the above and on his association with William Pepper, we might infer that Ned Davis may have been an <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro Albanian</a>. We have not found his name in the records of early Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Thus, he may not have married and raised a family. However, the early Albany record exhibits many references to the surname "Davis."  
 
 
<p>Perhaps he was the other free person living in Pepper's Watervliet household in <a href="../../census1790.html#2551">1790</a> (the assessment roll taken two years earlier noted they lived together) and again in <a href="../../census1800.html#2551">1800</a>.

<p>In or after <a href="http://trees.ancestry.com/tree/5153353/person/-1130044026/story/7d99fa3c-3aa3-48d7-a310-d03674d0dd69?src=search">1815</a>, an Edward ("Uncle Ned") Davis was best known schoolteacher in the town of Covington, Wyoming County, NY.

<p>With mostly unresolved and essential <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we must move on for now.</p>
