<strong>Mary Donneway </strong></a> was born during the late 1740s. We seek information on her background and early life.

<p>Probably in 1777, she became the wife of widower <a href="../s/pesharp7015.html">Peter Sharp</a>, whose last child from his first marriage had been baptized in December 1776. Mary's first child with Sharp was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in October 1778. Her marriage produced at least two more children.

<p>Her husband was a <a href="../../census1790.html#7015">prominent</a> carpenter and resident of the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7015">1800</a>, their third ward household included only a young boy and a man and a woman - both born before 1756.

<p>Peter Sharp died in 1813 at the age of seventy-eight. After that, the "widow Mary Sharp" was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at the corner of North Market and Orange 
(23 <a href="../../streets.html#orange">Orange Street</a>) at least until 1820. 

<p>Mary Donneway Sharp died on April 19, 1821 and was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA240&lpg">buried</a> in the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Pr</a>esbyterian cemetery plot. Her age at death was noted as seventy-five years.
