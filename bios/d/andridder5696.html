<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna De Ridder Yates</b></a> was born in 1726 and christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on August 28. She was the first child born to <a href="../../albanycounty.html">reg</a>ional landholder <a href="codridder7834.html">Cornelis De Ridder</a> and his first wife, <a href="../vd/suvdb5841.html">Susanna Vandenburgh</a>. Her mother died during Anna's childhood and her father remarried. Cornelis De Ridder is most often identified with <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>.</p>

<p>About 1746, twenty-year-old Anna De Ridder married ambitious Albany native <a href="../y/abyates1.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a>. By 1762, five of their children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were pewholders. Their marriage would further solidified a business relationship between Yates and Anna's father.</p>

<p>These Yateses set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Abraham began to build a legal practice and political following. As he often was called to public service beyond Albany, Anna managed their Albany interests and raised her small family. During the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>, her husband 
<a href="../../doc/ayjrjournal.html#011058">charged</a> that Anna was harrassed by British soldiers (who were quartered in their house) to the point that she suffered a miscarriage.</p> 

<p>While he was <a href="../../mayors.html#ayjr">mayor</a> of Albany during the 1790s, their <a href="#home">new home</a> was a Market Street <a href="../../census1790.html#1">landmark</a>. In 1790, their home (next to <a href="../../census1790.html#6867">that</a> of Domine Westerlo) housed twelve people - probably inferring her <a href="../l/abglansing3695.html">extended</a> family.</p>  

<p>Anna De Ridder Yates died in February 1795 ending a marriage of almost fifty years. Her husband died fourteen months later.</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Anna De Ridder Yates is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 5696. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. She is the 
        subject of a biographical essay by Shirley A. Rice published in <i>Women 
        of Colonial Albany: A Community History Calendar for 1986</i> (issued 
        by the Colonial Albany Project in 1986). A link to that essay will appear

      <a name=home></a><FONT size=-1><b>New home:</b> During the 1790s, Yates is said to have built a large house on 
        the east side of Market Street. Their descendants lived there for several 
        generations. The last parts of that building were torn down in the 1990s.
