<strong>John Denny</strong></a> was born before 1750. This individual was an officer in the Revolutionary army and <a href="#name">may</a> have been the person called "Captain John Denny."

<p>In 1767, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> of John Denny appeared on the <a href="../../sources.html#sh">rosters</a> of two separate Schenectady-based militia companies.

<p>In October 1770, he married "Ellenner (possibly aka Penelope) Leede" (perhaps she was a <a href="../l/lydius.html">Lydius</a>) at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. At that time, they were "both of Schenectady. A daughter was christened at the Albany Dutch church in October 1778.

<p> In June 1775, John Denny sent a communication to the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> from Schenectady. It seems to have included infomation taken from his recent trip to Montreal.  By the following June, he had been commissioned an ensign and then<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1JMLAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=%22denney%22&source=web&ots=kolchsmKH-&sig=IBmcYvchJinsmMwSTHN1fOl-7_0#PPA2,M1"> lieutenant</a> in the First New York regiment. At the end of 1776, his superiors evaluated their officers.  Denny, second lieutenant in the first company, was <a href="http://openlibrary.org/b/OL4260218M/History-of-the-First-New-York-Regiment,-1775-1783">said</a> to be "very good."  He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=heitman+officers&printsec=frontcover&source#PPA194,M1">may have served</a> until 1778. In May 1784, his former commander <a href="../vs/gvs.html">Goose Van Schaick</a>, submitted an <a href="#aff">affidavit</a> to the War Department in support of Denny's service. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> more information on his wartime activities.


<p>He may have been the John Denny whose large (ten people) household was configured on the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. Or, perhaps his was one of the three other John Denny's whose households were listed in Dutchess County at that time.

<p>By the late 1790s, he had settled in Albany. However, his name and holdings does not appear to have been considered on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment roll</a> in 1799.

<p>However, in <a href="../../census1800.html#3932">1800</a>, his first ward household included eight children and a couple who were over forty-five years old. A decade later, the Albany census listing for his household still included young children.

<p>John Denny is said to have died in 1812. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, the first Albany city directory <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA63,M1">listed</a> two married and/or widowed Denny women. One was widow Penelope - an innkeeper at 30 Eagle Street. In January 1831, "Penelope, wife of Capt. John of Revolutionary Army 
," was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/StPetEpChCemA-F.htm">buried</a> in the Episcopal cemetery plot.
