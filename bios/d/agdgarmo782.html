<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Agnietie De Garmo</strong></a> was born in March 1692. She was the daughter of <a href="pdegarmo947.html">Pierre</a> (aka "Villeroy") and Albany native <a href="../vd/cavdh5675.html">Catharina Vanderheyden</a> De Garmo. Agnes grew up a middle child in the large family of a French ancestry woodlands operative whose city <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#947">home</a> was located in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In September 1720, she married <a href="../b/epbogardus6368.html">Ephraim Bogardus</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1734, eight children honoring the names of the grandparents were christened at the Albany church where both parents were occasional baptism sponsors. Her older <a href="andgarmo783.html">sister</a> had previously married Ephraim's older brother and was raising a family in Albany as well.

<p>Following the birth of their last child in 1734, this Bogardus family has not been linked to the community-based record. Perhaps they relocated to the south or out the Mohawk Valley as a sweep of the <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a> has referenced their names in Coxsackie and/or also in today's Fulton County. 

<p>Agnietie De Garmo Bogardus is said to have <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/w/r/i/Cheryl-L-Wright/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0239.html">died</a> in Coxsackie in 1772. We seek more definitive information on her later life and passing. </p>
