      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob De Garmo</strong></a> was born in 
        November 1732. He was the first child born to Albany natives <a href="jedgarmo809.html">Jellis</a> 
        and <a href="../e/raeverts7999.html">Rachel Evertsen</a> De Garmo. He 
        grew up in a shoemaker's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In May 1758, he married <a href="../b/fybecker.html">Fytie Becker</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1775, five 
        children had been christened in Albany where he was a pewholder and occasional 
        baptism sponsor. 
      <p>He also was a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> (sometimes 
        called a "cordwainer") who <a href="../../census1756.html#232">lived</a> 
        in the first ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1755">1755</a>, he was 
        appointed constable and high constable. In 1767, his name appeared on 
        the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. 
      <p>In October 1756, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willpibogardus.html">will</a> 
        of Pieter Bogardus. In 1773, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willishogan4320.html">will</a> 
        of his neighbor, Isaac Hogan. 
      <p>During the 1770s, Jacob De Garmo was a lieutenant in the Fourteenth Regiment 
        of the Albany County militia. Later, he was accorded a land bounty right 
        in conjunction with the Third Regiment. In July 1777, he was paid for 
        services by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>. By the 
        end of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, he 
        may have re-located to eastern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a> where a Jacob De Garmo was listed on the census for Pittstown 
        in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>.</p>
