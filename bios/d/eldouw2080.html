<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elsie Douw Fonda</b></a> was born in August 1731. She was the first-born daughter of Albany residents <a href="abdouw2052.html">Abraham</a> 
        and <a href="../w/cawinne2826.html">Lyntie Winne</a> Douw. Her mother died in 1749 and her father, a prominent skipper and city officer, later re-married. In 1757, she was among those named in the <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne3032.html">will</a> of her bachelor uncle who also was her father's mentor and benefactor. She would inherit considerable assets from other family members in the years to come.</p>

<p>In July 1753, Elsie married the somewhat older Albany businessman <a href="../f/gysfonda3782.html">Gysbert Fonda</a>. Between 1755 and 1773, her seven children were baptized in the Albany         <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Fondas lived comfortably in "a good house" on Pearl Street until the 1770s. However, following the outbreak of hostilities, Albany native Gysbert could <a href="../../friends.html">not</a> support the cruade for American liberties and was under suspicion throughout the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Revolutionary era</a>. He did manage to re-establish himself after the war but died in 1788 leaving Elsie a widow at age fifty-seven. His <a href="../../wills/willgyfonda.html">will</a> named her heir and co-executor - adding to the property she had inherited from her recently deceased father.

<p>Elsie <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2080">main</a>tained the <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a> property and some lots along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a>. But soon she lodged with her <a href="../f/cafonda3805.html">daughter</a>, 
        the wife of entrepreneur newcomer <a href="../l/rilush1047.html">Richard 
        Lush</a>. She maintained her substantial holdings for several decades and was taxed as a wealthy resident of Lush's household in 1809.</p>

<p>A widow for more than thirty-five years, Elsie Douw Fonda lived out her life in the landmark home on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a> with her then widowed daughter. She was buried from there in July 1823 at the age of ninety-two!</p>
