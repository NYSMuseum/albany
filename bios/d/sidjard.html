<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referenced variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Simon Desjardins</strong></a> spent time in Albany and its environs during the 1790s. He was among a <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> enclave of those who fled <a href="../french.html">France</a> ahead of the so-called "Reign of Terror." However, he appears to have been sent to America by investors to pioneer what turned out to be an ill-fated settlement venture in northern New York. His subsequent life in America was lengthy and developed far <a href="../../na/na.html">beyond</a> our parameters. This sketch will <a href="../../res/context.html">focus</a> on his time in Albany.

<p>He is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=H7wAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA37&lpg=PA37&dq=simon+desjardins+albany&source=bl&ots=rTDns6oV2v&sig=EWVmP_NqX5ZhJ4QA3y0RJrMJnJ0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3vfiQ-PnUAhUMez4KHf-tArgQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&q=simon%20desjardins%20albany&f=false">said to have been</a> "a gentleman of culture and learning, and had been a chamberlain of Louis XVI." 

<p>After a dramatic voyage from France, Desjardins and his family landed in New York in mid-September 1793. A number of logistical factors led him to Albany where he would be "156 miles closer" to the ultimate destination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castorland,_New_York">Castorland</a> in northern New York State. His move to Albany was not without <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WfGL2NYGfN4C&pg=PA7&dq=14+september+1793+to+the+20th+of+the+same&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYv9_tve_UAhVByT4KHWV3DfgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=14%20september%201793%20to%20the%2020th%20of%20the%20same&f=false">drama</a> of its own. Chronicling the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WfGL2NYGfN4C&pg=PA8&dq=20+september+%22left+new+york+for+albany%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjir8vLv-_UAhXDHD4KHRI5C00Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=20%20september%20%22left%20new%20york%20for%20albany%22&f=false">trip</a> in his journal, Desjardins arrived in Albany on September 23. His detailed impressions on reaching Albany are the <a href="../../res/visitors.html#1793">observations</a> of an articulate newcomer.

<p>After meeting Albany's <a href="#finest">finest</a>, Desjardins was not able to secure suitable lodgings for his family and associates. Thus, his party <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">trekked</a> to Schenectady but soon set off for their northwesterly destination - using the Mohawk whenever possible. That forty-day excursion is more completely chronicled in <a href="http://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov/publications/bulletin/498-15621.pdf"><i>The Navigators</i></a>. 


<p>By October 1794, Desjardins (1756-1841) was able to purchase a lot on Watervliet Street from <a href="../g/thvwgraham8215.html">Th</a>eodorus Van Wyck Graham. 


<p>One <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=saO7aeaoUy4C&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=desjardins+albany&source=bl&ots=MmXQk61krC&sig=wj6xQUsNRqipcpNzk9tiNqObdrU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwir4JKH7_nUAhUBYj4KHfknAUIQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&q=desjardins%20albany&f=false">source</a> has identified him and his cohort Pierre Pharoux as "emigre-architect-engineers" who may have influenced <a href="../h/phhooker.html">Philip Hooker</a>.

<p>In August 1797, a <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#sidj">fire</a> destroyed the house he occupied on Market Street which was owned by <a href="../t/cojtbroeck.html">Cornelis Ten Broeck</a>.

      <p>Unlike his other Catholic countrymen, he does not seem to have taken part in 
        the formation of <a href="../../org/stmarys.html">St. Mary's</a> Roman 
        Catholic church. We surmise that he was married but have yet to find information 
        on his wife or family. 
      <p>During the mid-1790s, he <a href="../../res/guess.html">seems</a> to have used Albany as his seasonal fallback residence while he attempted to establish the Castorland settlement. Following the accidental drowning of his <a href="http://catalog.huntington.org/search/oocn314413354">partner</a> in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=H9QOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=pharoux+castorland&source=bl&ots=APEMkIQwRL&sig=Yah4HtBLLkTnXX4aaEAtC2pFOaw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwio2fOpp4HVAhVGOz4KHT0-AXEQ6AEITTAJ#v=onepage&q=pharoux%20castorland&f=false">1795</a>, Desjardins carried on for a while but left upstate New York as the venture was destined to fail.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, his house and lot on Market Street was valued substantially although he was identified as a "non resident."

      <p>By that time, Simon Desjardins probably had left Albany. His subsequent life 
        in America over the next thirty years has <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> 
        been investigated. He is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WfGL2NYGfN4C&pg=PR11&lpg=PR11&dq=desjardins+delaware&source=bl&ots=Ln7IgAe6LP&sig=NIBOvcAH6w8lwbSnDgrPt1KNPcc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD-N_R9_7UAhUKbz4KHdzUB2s4ChDoAQghMAA#v=onepage&q=desjardins%20delaware&f=false">said</a> 
        to have died in Delaware in 1841.</p>
