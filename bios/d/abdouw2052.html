      <P><A href="#sources"><B>Abraham Douw</B></A> was born in November 1706. 
        He was the eldest son of the five children born to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        residents Volkert and Margarita Van Tricht Douw.</P>
      <P>Abraham grew up learning to sail from the Douws who were well-represented 
        among Hudson River <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">skippers</a>. His 
        long career spanned much of the eighteenth century during which he was 
        among the most active of the Albany-based Hudson River sloop captains.</P>
      <p>He married <a href="../w/cawinne2826.html">Lyntie Winne</a> in 1730. 
        She was the sister of <a href="../w/piwinne3032.html">Captain Pieter Winne</a> 
        who became Abraham's sailing mentor and benefactor. That marriage produced 
        four children before her death in 1749. 
      <p>The couple set up their household in the <a href="../../wards.html">third 
        ward</a> - near the waterfront and the homes of Albany's other <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">river 
        people</a>. Douw established his Albany credentials by serving as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
        in 1738 and qualifying to vote in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2052">1742</a>. 
        In 1748, he was elected third ward alderman. He was re-elected eleven 
        times - serving until 1760. By the 1750s, he was a <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
        Street</a> mainstay - skipper, trader, and <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> member.</p>
      <p>His <a href="../../census1756.html#321">prominence</a> was based on the 
        association with bachelor Pieter Winne in the river trade where he took 
        over for the assemblyman and later <a href="../../wills/willpiwinne3032.html">inherited</a> 
        Winne's sloop and rigging - as well as his home and stables. Captain Douw 
        carried cargoes and dispatches during the last two <a href="../../7yw.html#wars">colonial 
        wars</a> and throughout the period for <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir William 
        Johnson</a> and others. Through Johnson, he was appointed to the county 
        court. 
      <p>In 1741, Douw and Winne were named among the partners in the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga 
        Patent</a>. 
      <p>In 1761, Abraham married widow <a href="../l/calansing3187.html">Catharina 
        Lansing</a>. Over the next decades, he became more of a businessman and 
        real estate trader. During that time, he acquired additional Albany acreage 
        as well as shares in tracts in the upper Mohawk and Hudson Valleys. His 
        son, Peter Winne Douw, ran the sloop and later followed Abraham to the 
        city council. Too old for service during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War 
        for Independence</a>, the septuagenarian was a respected Albany patriot, 
        "gentleman," landlord, dock owner, and later superintendent of docks.</p>
      <p>Abraham Douw filed his will in May 1787. It named his second wife Catherine, 
        sons Volkert and <a href="pwdouw.html">Peter</a>, and daughters Elsie 
        Fonda and Margaret Ten Eyck as his heirs. He died in December 1787. This 
        Albany skipper was in his seventy-eighth year.</p>
