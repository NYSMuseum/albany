      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes De Wandelaer, Jr.</strong></a> 
        was born in New York during the 1670s. He was the son of <a href="jodewan6162.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../s/saschepmoes.html">Sara Schepmoes</a> De Wandelaer. To 
        prevent confusion, he would be known as "Johannes De Wandelaer, Junior." 
        Shortly thereafter, his parents established a second residence in Albany 
        where Johannes Sr. would trade furs and real estate for much of the remainder 
        of his life. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#086">1697</a>, Johannes Jr. was alone 
        in the family's Albany house. He would marry, inherit property from his 
        parents, and set down roots that made him an Albany mainstay for the next 
        two decades. 
      <p>In April 1701, he married Albany native <a href="../g/elgansevoort4704.html">Elizabeth 
        Gansevoort</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1722, ten children had been christened in Albany. 
      <p>In 1705, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjodwand.html">will</a> 
        filed by his father. At that time, he also was identified as co-guardian 
        of his minor siblings and as co-executor of the estate. 
      <p>Johannes Jr. followed his father and father-in-law in business and settled 
        down in a house on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. 
        <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6168">Assessment rolls</a> valued 
        his third ward property moderately. He served as juror, roadmaster, and, 
        beginning in 1705, was <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">elected</a> 
        assistant alderman. He served on a number of committees including those 
        formed to develop Albany's holdings at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 
        In 1720, he was counted as a freeholder in Schaghticoke - where he probably 
        had relocated to a farm on his own property. 
      <p>Into the 1730s, Johannes De Wandelaer, Jr. still maintained his Albany 
        residence. He was last heard from in 1736 when he purchased additional 
        land along the Tomhannock Creek.</p>
