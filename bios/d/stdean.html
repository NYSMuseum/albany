<P><A href="#biography"><B>Stewart Dean</B></A> was early Albany's most famous navigator. His voyage from Albany to China and back during the mid-1780s represents a pioneering effort to connect the emerging city of Albany with the outside world.</p>

<P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/ltsdean.jpg" border=1 width=150 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Stewart Dean"></a> Stewart Dean was <a href="#origins">born</a> on the eastern shore of Maryland in 1748. Eighteen years later, the name of Stewart Dean, "an orphan," appears in the Somerset County records as he was apprenticed for three years to learn the arts of sailing and navigation under Maryland merchant Henry Lowe.

<p>Freed from his apprenticeship on his twenty-first birthday, Dean soon migrated north to the Hudson Valley and entered the maritime trade. In 1771, the new <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> noted that his sloop, the <i>Beaver</i>, had sailed for the West Indies with a cargo of flour and lumber. He was one of only a handful of Albany-based skippers who ranged beyond the Hudson. 
			
<p>In 1773, he was identified as a "mariner" when he posted a bond to marry Albany native and shipwright's daughter <a  href="../b/pibradt4271.html">Pieterje Bradt</a>. After the wedding, the couple settled in Albany and began to raise a family.</P>

<p>About 1775, Dean purchased a lot along the <a href="../../images/map1793.jpg">newly reclaimed</a> Albany waterfront. Located near the city docks, the riverside home he built on <a href="../../streets.html#dock">Dock Street</a> would be Dean's base of operations for many years.</p>

            <p>With the outbreak of the war, Stewart Dean offered his services to the American 
              cause and was commissioned a privateer in June 1776. During the 
              next three years, his ship, the <i>Beaver</i>, cruised the Caribbean 
              Atlantic - taking prizes and loading cargoes to aid the American 
              war effort. His biographer, William Wilgus, has devoted an entire 
              chapter to Dean's <a href="#exploits">nautical exploits</a>. 
            <p>Dean had returned to Albany in the spring of 1777 and was enlisted by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> to seize and appraise the sloop of Tory skipper <a href="../h/rohoak8472.html">Robert Hoaksley</a>. In January 1778, he was elected a member of the Committee. 

<p>At the same time, (1776-77), he served the American cause on land as he accompanied the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> to Johnstown in 1776 and went into the Mohawk Valley several times afterwards in search of <a href="../../friends.html">T</a>ories. In 1780, he was selected to serve as one of the <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies</a> - an 
            important arm of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">political revolution</a> 
            charged with rooting out internal enemies during the last years of the war.</p>

<p></p>In January 1782, he went to Philadelphia to build the privateer <i>Nimrod</i> which he sailed to the West Indies. In July, the schooner was captured by the British while at anchor in St. Kitts. Dean and his ship were carried to Antigua and later <a href="#exploits">released</a>.<p></p>

          <p>Back in Albany by early 1783, Stewart Dean suffered the loss of his wife while 
            she was giving birth to their son. <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/experiment_in_the_south_china_sea.htm"><img src="../../images/jpg/ltexperimentchina.jpg" align=left border=1 width=200 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="The Experiment in the South China Sea"></a> 
            Inspired by the voyage of the <i>Empress of China</i> to the Orient, 
            in 1784 Dean began to build a new sloop, the <i>Experiment</i>! By 
            year's end, the <i>Experiment</i> left Albany on the first leg of 
            a <a href="http://www.albany.edu/museum/wwwmuseum/tantillo/VoyagE.html">voyage 
            to China</a>. By the summer of 1787, Dean was back in Albany and had 
            married <a href="../w/mgtwhetten.html">Margaret Whetten</a> - daughter 
            of a sea captain and sister of one of his <i>Experiment</i> mates. 
            Their first child was baptized in Albany in 1788. By 1807, he was 
            the father of seven children.</p>

          <p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#5135">1790</a>, Stewart Dean had re-established 
            himself in Albany - although, over the next decade, he undertook <a href="../../inprog.html">several 
            voyages abroad</a>. In 1805, he was elected to the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">city 
            council</a>. A few years later, he moved out to <a href="../../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor 
            Hill</a> but still maintained his house and dock on the Albany waterfront. 
            He spent the next decade there surrounded by grandchildren. In 1826, 
            Dock Street was re-named for him.</p>

<p>In 1830, Stewart (age 83) and Margaret Dean left Albany to live in the home of their children in Lima New York. In 1833, he was granted a pension for service during the American Revolution.</p>

<p>Stewart and Margaret moved with them (the Sedgwicks of Lima) to New York City. Stewart Dean died in New York City in August 1836. His newspaper obituary said Captain Dean was ninety years old and a "Famous Albany Navigator." His grave stone stands today in the churchyard at Manhattan's historic Trinity Church.</p>

<p>Historical artist Len Tantillo's <a href="../../loc/experiment.html">painting depicting Dean's return to Albany on the <i>Experiment</i> in 1787</a> and the process of creating it have become major resources for furthering our understanding of the people of colonial Albany and their world at a critical point in the community's history. Stewart Dean was early Albany's first famous sailor and one of a number of important <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> who were major agents of change in the evolution of this <a href="../../earlycity.html">early American city</a>.

<P><A href="../../criteria.html"><IMG align=left alt="the people of colonial Albany" border=1 width=30 height=30 hspace=4 src="../../images/jpg/logoicon.jpg" vspace=4></A> <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Stewart Dean</B> is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 5135. This profile is derived chiefly from community-based resources. The most recent and most interesting treatment was produced by historical archeologist Matthew Kirk and is entitled: "Stewart Dean: The Archaeology of a Pilot, Privateer, and Entrepreneur," and is available <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/staffpubs/docs/20232.PDF">online</a>, beginning on p. 151. In addition, Dean's life has been the subject of a number of <a href="../../res/ts.html">antiquarian</a> studies. The most substantial of these is William J. Wilgus, <i>The Life of Captain Stewart Dean: A Character of the American Revolution</i> (Ascutney, VT, 1942). A few copies of this privately printed pamphlet were deposited at the <a href="http://unix2.nysed.gov/">New York State Library</a> and other major repositories. Although focused on his riverside home and holdings, the now <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/staffpubs/docs/20232.PDF">online article</a> by historical archeologist Matthew Kirk appears to be most comprehensive and accessible. See also biographical information from an earlier transcription as published in  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Jak1bYEIrzgC&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=%22the+experiment%22+stewart+dean&source=bl&ots=8rYFRYjYbg&sig=BqIIHUPIAz3MF4FuR9WvtSM-mbk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI64LpsZWmyAIVBm4-Ch33-QKc#v=onepage&q=%22the%20experiment%22%20stewart%20dean&f=false"><i>Historical Magazine</i></a> (1857). Subsequent expositions are to some extent derivative of Wilgus's pioneering but sentimental work. However, an <a href="http://www.pem.org/sites/neptune/voyage.htm">on-line article</a> on the <i>Experiment</i> by Paul E. Fontenoy is rich in other useful ways.

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; An <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Celebrating-Albany-s-adventurous-ancient-mariner-904945.php">online</a> newspaper article from December 2010  illustrates the teaching value of the voyage. A focused <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22the+experiment%22+%22stewart+dean%22">Google search</a> yields additional resources.</p>
