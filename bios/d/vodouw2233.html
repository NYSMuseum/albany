<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Volkert A. Douw</strong></a> was born in March 1713. He was the son of <a href="andouw2057.html">Andries Douw</a> and perhaps his third wife, Lydia De Meyer Douw. He grew up in the east side <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> home of a prominent landholder, skipper, and official.  A younger, <a href="vodouw2235.html">same-named</a> Albany resident was born in 1733.
<p>In April 1752, he was almost forty when he married Albany native <a href="../b/rabogert6143.html">Rachel Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage may only have produced two children.

<p>In May 1755, he was noted in the <a href="../../wills/willcobogert6063.html">will</a> filed by his father-in-law.

<p>This individual was an Albany resident. He later called himself an 
Albany merchant and also was at least part owner of a "still house." However, at least two other same-named individuals (including mayor <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert P. Douw</a>) were living in and around Albany during his adult lifetime. At this point, we hesitate to commit non-focused qualitative information to this profile. Perhaps, he was elected alderman in the third ward beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1759">1759</a>. The property of Volkert A. Douw was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> from the mid-1760s. 



<p>Volkert A. Douw filed a <a href="../../wills/willvodouw2233.html">will</a> in June 1768. It identified substantial real property and more liquid assets which he left to his wife and two living children. He died at the end of August. His widow survived until 1780. His <a href="anddouw2058.html">son</a>, born years before his parents' actual wedding, became an Albany resident but was not to be long-lived.</p>
