<P>At least one Albany resident of the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century was known by some <a href="../../res/sp.html">variant</a> of <a href="#sources"><strong>James Daniels</strong></a>. The subject of this profile was born between 1774 and 1785 - but probably during the 1770s. We seek defining information on this subject's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7757">1800</a>, the name "James Daniel" appeared on the census of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. At that time, only one man lived in the household and he was between sixteen and twenty-six years of age. A <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">year earlier</a>, his personal property valued at $50 under the first ward (probably on Court Street) home of <a href="../d/ridunn7903.html">Richard Dunn</a> who was enumerated next to "James Daniel" in 1800. In 1804, Daniels was identified as a resident of State Street who boarded senators Foote <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iD1DAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA118&lpg=PA118&dq=foote+van+schoonhoven&source=bl&ots=scFBWZ2Zny&sig=iMAgqHswfSqpgHE5jK_PpEVLxVM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAmoVChMIh-yd0K2hxwIVRGg-Ch1iKw3F#v=onepage&q=foote%20van%20schoonhoven&f=false">and</a> Van Schoonhoven. By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, James Daniel was the head of an Albany household composed of an adult couple and seven younger persons.

<p>In <a href="http://www.omdhs.syracusemasons.com/sites/default/files/history/Craft%20Masonry%20in%20Albany%20County.pdf">1807</a>, James Daniels was listed as "Senior Deacon" of "Union <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Lodge</a> #1."

<p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22james+daniels%22+albany+ny+1820&start=20">name</a> of "James Daniels" was included among the members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal Church for 1811-14. 

<p>The first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in 1813, listed <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=%22daniel+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22daniel%20james%22&f=false">two addresses</a> for "James Daniel." One was identified as an "earthenware house" at 123 Market Street. The other identified Daniels as a "hatter" living at 14 Court. Both addresses were continued in similar fashion in subsequent directories for a number of years.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, the household of "James Daniels" was configured on the Albany census. At that time, six people were living there.  

<p>A <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> document dated March 1825 and later filed in Albany <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA131&lpg=PA131&dq=euphemia+daniel+albany&source=bl&ots=4SIp_tpTYO&sig=NwXD3V2ozpw3Fq2TsvkMKoS-3Fg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAmoVChMIw4am8LWhxwIVgUo-Ch1MVQos#v=onepage&q=euphemia%20daniel%20albany&f=false">referenced</a> "Euphemia, wife of James Daniel of Albany" as the niece of testator Rebecca Dole.

<p>Past diminishing <a href="../../res/irs.html">returns</a> and with so many similarly named individuals at-risk in the region, we move on for now from the life of Albany resident James Daniels.</p>
