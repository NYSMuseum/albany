<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth De Meyer</strong></a> was born in August 1666. She was the daughter of New York residents Nicholas and Lydia Van Dyck De Meyer. Her <a href="../ger.html">German</a> ancestry <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_De_Mayer">father</a> was the one-time mayor of New York while her Dutch mother emigrated to New Amsterdam where she married De Meyer.

<p>In August 1687, she married <a href="../s/phphschuyler.html">Philip Schuyler</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in New York. Their family was small. A son named Philip was christened in Kingston in 1689 but did not live. A second son named <a href="../s/nischuyler1730.html">Nicholas</a> was baptized in New York September 1691.

<p>In 1691, her mother was dead and her father re-married when she was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8LAFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=%22nicholas+de+meyer%22&source=bl&ots=dPtTDxBcCN&sig=zUZjgznwj8DAKzk-h9DiGaSUMfc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5XcuUJ7wHsaL7AGFjIDgBA&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20de%20meyer%22&f=false">bequeathed</a> a share of Nicholas De Meyer's substantial estate.

<p>The now well-endowed Elizabeth's husband was a younger son in the large househhold of the founder of Albany's pre-eminent New Netherland-era <a href="../s/schuyler.html">family</a>.

<p>These Schuylers lived primarily in New York but perhaps in Kingston, Albany (where her father once owned property), and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> as well.

<p>Nicholas Schuyler later wrote in his <a href="#bible">bible</a> that on May 4, 1712 "my mother . . . went to bed sick, and on the 13th . . . fell asleep in the Lord." Elizabeth De Meyer Schuyler was buried in the church at Schenectady. She had lived about fifty-eight years. Elizabeth's husband re-married in 1718 and lived until 1724.</p>
