<P><a href="#sources"><b>Volckert Janse</b></a> was the son of Jan Douw of Friesland, Holland. Much <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/douw.html">lore</a> surrounds the early part of his life! He is said to have been an officer in the Dutch army and then an exile in Denmark. He came to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in 1638. He was the founder of the <a href="douw.html">Douw family</a> of early Albany! </p>


<p>He married <a href="../vb/dovbred.html">Dorothe Van Breestede</a> in New Amsterdam on April 19, 1650. Over the next three decades the marriage produced eleven children who further established the family in Albany and its environs. During that time, he was a member and deacon at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>By 1660, these Douws had settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he headed the list of <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#vjd">principal fur traders</a>. His Beverwyck-based business was multi-dimensional and he was an <a href="../../sources.html#cma">active litigant</a> before the town court.  Earlier, he had been called a <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">skipper</a>. He also operated an Albany <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewery</a> located near the river.</p>

<p>He was an Albany magistrate under both the Dutch and English, served as an <a href="../../cia.html">Indian commissioner</a>, and frequently represented others in court. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="more to come!"></a>
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#vjd">1679</a>, his Albany home was included on the assessment roll. That property on the southwest corner of <a href="../../map/map1676.html">State and Court</a> Streets remained in the family for many years. It was known as "Douw's Corner" into the nineteenth century!</p>

<p>Volckert Janse also owned substantial lands in <a href="#lands">various parts</a> of the Hudson Valley. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="more to come!"></a></p>



<p>Volckert Janse Douw made a will in 1680 and died in 1681.</p>
