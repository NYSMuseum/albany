<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"><strong>Andries De Vos</strong></a> was <a href="http://www.gulbangi.com/5families-o/p490.htm">born</a> in Holland within a few years of 1600. We seek information on his background although we <a href="http://www.familypursuit.com/genealogy/de-vos_andries/andries-de-vos-b.1599-d.1675-1">note</a> some work on his parentage.

<p>In March 1625, he is said to have married Maria Coeymans. Several of their children <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/g/r/a/Carole-J-Graham-NE/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0850.html">emigrated</a> to New Netherland with them in 1641. He was the brother-in-law of fellow <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneer</a> Barent Pieterse <a href="../c/bacoey6155.html">Coey</a>mans. 

<p>He is said to have been a carpenter by trade and to have occupied a saw and grist mill in what became <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. During the 1640s, he was said to have been a member of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5e8TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=court+minutes+of+rensselaerswyck&source=bl&ots=Rg3ezN-o-n&sig=qYsx3jGHGZmGLlWDTpb8YCm3cv0&hl=en&ei=TQPITeOgMsHq0QHEu5msCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">court</a> of Rensselaerswyck. He also was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5e8TAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA223&lpg=PA223&dq=de+vos+andries&source=bl&ots=Rg3ezN-o-n&sig=qYsx3jGHGZmGLlWDTpb8YCm3cv0&hl=en&ei=TQPITeOgMsHq0QHEu5msCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">regular</a> litigant and subject of its deliberations. In 1649, he had a servant named Huybert.

<p>He was living near <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> during the 1650s. In 1653, he owned a woodlot and then other real property within the stockade. In May <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#7852">1660</a>, his name appeared on a list of <a href="../../furtrade.html">traders</a> who favored freedom to meet fur bearing Indians beyond of the Beverwyck stockade. He was well known in a number of capacities by the Beverwyck <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/minutescourtfor00laergoog#page/n322/mode/2up">court</a>.

<p>His wife is said to have died in 1665.
 
<p>Andries De Vos probably was dead by the mid 1670s. Without surviving sons, the family name dropped from Albany rolls following his death.</p>
