<P><a href="#sources"><b>Magdalena Douw</b></a> was born in May 1750. She was the daughter of Albany leader <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert P. Douw</a> and his wife, <a href="adp7822.html">Anna De Peyster</a>. She grew up in Albany and across the river at the family seat called <a href="douw.html#wol">Wolvenhook</a>.</p>

<p>In 1770, this twenty-year-old daughter of the past mayor of Albany married city treasurer's son  <a href="../s/jostevenson2244.html">John Stevenson</a> at St. Peter's Anglican church. Over the next two decades, their children were baptized in Albany churches while Magdalena maintained her pew in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>During the 1770s, Stevenson built a grand home on <a href="../../loc/statestreet.html">upper State Street</a>. A self-proclaimed British subject, he was under fire throughout the war years. He was imprisoned, and, for a time, banished to Boston. With her husband's business arrested by the war, Magdalena took her children to the protection of the <a href="../d/douw.html">Douw family</a> who were Revolutionary stalwarts!</p>

<p>After the war, John Stevenson re-surfaced as a manufacturer and as one of the architects of the "new" Albany. The family settled into their <a href="../../census1790.html#2244">landmark home</a> and were attended by many servants.</p> 

<p>Magdalena lost her husband in April 1810. She then was identified as the head of her household at <a href="../s/jostevenson2244.html#home">92 State Street</a>. Magdalena Douw Stevenson died in December 1817. The following spring, letters of administration were issued on her estate. </p>
