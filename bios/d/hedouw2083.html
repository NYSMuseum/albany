<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Douw</b></a> was born about 1673. He was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="vjd.html">Volckert Janse</a> and Dorotie Van Bresdtede Douw.</p>

<p>In 1697, he married <a href="../vi/comvi2340.html">Neeltje (Cornelia) Van Iveren</a> Van Bergen - a widow who already had given birth to six children. By 1709, their six Douw children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, deacon, and frequent baptism sponsor. His pew seat <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22hendrick+douw%22&source=bl&ots=wwgH7Wxbjz&sig=kdbHdOoChe_8cbEgL0ffclzhCR4&hl=en&ei=4JqdSbbUHZCCNbXriY0F&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result">later</a> was transferred to his son, Johannes.</p>

<p>These Douws lived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> where Hendrick held several parcels of land - including a farm on Papskanee Island. Both he and Neeltie also owned <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2083">houses</a> in Albany. Hendrick's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> dwelling was rented. He served as a constable for Rensselaerswyck. In 1715, he was a juror at the Albany court. His name appeared on a list of freeholders in Rensselaerswyck in 1720.</p>

<p>Hendrick Douw filed a <a href="../../wills/willhedouw.html">will</a> in 1749. It left real property east of the Husdon and substantial personal assets to his children and a smaller bequest to his wife. He died in May 1751. </p>
