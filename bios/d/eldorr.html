<strong>Elisha Dorr</strong></a> was born in March 1764. He was the sixth son of Matthew <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/report/rr06/rr06_381.htm">and</a> Elizabeth Palmer <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/dorr.html">Dorr</a> of Lyme, Connecticut.  His mother died in 1775. His father re-married and raised a large, combined family. <a href="http://freepages.family.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bridges2/bridges2/24519.html">A</a> Matthew Dorr died in Athens, Ohio in 1801.

<p>Elisha is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA553&lpg=PA553&dq=%22elisha+dorr%22+soldier&source=bl&ots=GwKfsftVai&sig=oT8ZIbxV2Hzyvs58MtibVWCVMYU&hl=en&ei=WEdOSqL6D4SHtgfD--jsDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3">said</a> to have served in the War for Independence as a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">soldier</a> in the Revolutionary army on Long Island.

<p>Afterwards, he is <a href="../../res/ts.html">thought</a> to have been associated with John Jacob Astor and to have come to Albany to deal in furs and skins. However, such claims are still <a href="../../inprog.html">un</a>substantiated.

<p>His wife <a href="http://nichirenscoffeehouse.net/gen/d0008/g0000052.htm#I06184">was</a> the somewhat older Dutchess County native <a href="../b/elbrouwer.html">Elizabeth Brouwer</a>. Between 1797 and 1810, the marriage produced six children. While his wife first was a <a href="../../lutheran.html">L</a>utheran, he was a member, deacon, and elder of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p><a href=#miniature><img src="../../images/jpg/eldorr.jpg" align=left border=0 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200 alt="Elisha Dorr about 1793"></a>In January 1793, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=elisha+dorr+hat+manufactory&source=bl&ots=JOmpL_O92I&sig=G4kHeJcROIOxUFeBH884mcPm2t0&hl=en&ei=NENOStOQNYWqtge2nL2vBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1">advertized</a> his hat manufactory on Maiden Lane - a few doors west of the <a href="../../loc/markethouse.html">Market House</a>. He offered a range of hats as well as 200 barrels of "the best cyder for sale cheap."
 
<p>In 1798, his name appeared on an Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">jury list</a>. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/hatter.html">hatter</a>. Perhaps he was among the founders of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. He served as a trustee for a number of years.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his modest holdings on <a href="../../streets.html#lodge">Lodge Street</a> were valued on the city assessment rolls. Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#7877">1800</a>, his household was configured on the census for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 

 <p>By the time of the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22dorr,+elisha%22&source=bl&ots=2hLxOZXx9A&sig=1u1u_V4JYutjq_trCGqkeuehJ04&hl=en&ei=JzFfSpOOH46itgfMkZzgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4">1813</a>, he had re-located his hattery to South Market Street and his residence to Division Street.

<p>From 1808 to 1810, he <a href="../../wills/willjevr5085.html">served</a> as surrogate of Albany County.

<p>Mostly after 1800, he was a trustee and director of a number of Albany-based civic and corporate entities.

<p>Later, he became a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2aQkLfnyCIIC&pg=PA302&lpg=PA302&dq=%22elisha+dorr%22&source=bl&ots=S3QUsewZ5o&sig=AnXCfIV9-3zd6bqcaKV9-7jEfIc&hl=en&ei=kyRPSu7iCMKFtgeI_ZDfDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9">noted</a> horticulturalist - in particular developing new varieties of plums.

<p>Over the years, he lived in a number of residences - mostly along North and South Market Streets.

<p>Elizabeth died in September 1837. Elisha Dorr <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#PPR1,M1">died</a> in April 1843 at the age of eighty. He had lived in Albany for sixty years. His will passed probate on June 8.</p>
