      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter Dox</strong></a> was born in October 
        1742. He was the son of Abraham and Rebecca Marselis Dox. He seems to 
        have been the only son in a small Albany-area family. His father appears 
        to have died while Peter was still a young boy. During the mid-<a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, 
        his widowed mother's property was valued on assessment rolls for the West 
        <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">M</a>anor. 
      <p>Later resources <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA501&lpg=PA501&dq=%22peter+dox%22+1831&source=bl&ots=GwMdpgpZce&sig=n3mIcgzzLEv-XE3_JgJWbfWDkBU&hl=en&ei=CHVcS4v8EYeOlAfJ2rDACQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CB4Q6AEwCTgo#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20dox%22%201831&f=false">noted</a> 
        that he had served in the French and Indian <a href="../../7yw.html">War</a>. 
      <p>Afterwards, William <a href="../../sources.html#jp">J</a>ohnson and <a href="../../res/ts.html">others</a> 
        knew him as a merchant and as a skipper on the Hudson River. As late as 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, an Albany voter list 
        still identified him as a skipper. Still later, he was called a "<a href="../../econ/comec.html">merchant</a>." 
      <p>Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> era information is 
        available for indivduals with his name. In March 1777, he was ordered 
        to appear before the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany committee</a> and 
        denied charges that he owned the liquor and other illegal merchandize 
        that was carried on his sloop between Albany and Fishkill. Afterwards, 
        the Albany Peter Dox was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#567">bounty 
        right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        regiment. 
      <p>About <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=dox&sourc">1779</a>, 
        he had married Albany-area resident <a href="../l/calansing3197.html">Catharina 
        Lansing</a>. By 1790, six <a href="#*">children</a> had been christened 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a 
        member and supporter. 
      <p>In January <a href="../../org/cc.html#1778">1778</a>, he was appointed 
        constable. In 1782, he was named chimney viewer for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. During the 1780s, he had a number of dealings with the city 
        government regarding rents and accounts. Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#567">1779</a>, 
        with one <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#567">exception</a>, Albany 
        assessment rolls valued his properties as either real estate or personal 
        property but not as a residence. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#567">1790</a>, the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> 
        census configured his household north of Albany near the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">V</a>an 
        Rensselaer Manor House. In <a href="../../census1800.html#567">1800</a>, 
        his third ward residence included ten family-age members and four servants. 
        In August 1797, a great <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#mont">fire</a> 
        destroyed his dwellinghouse (and place of residence) and stables on Montgomery 
        Street and his dwellinghouse and stable on <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#dock">Dock 
        Street</a>. Each of those houses had boarders lived there. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#567">1808</a>, "Peter Dox and 
        Sons" were invited to the funeral of a North Albany neighbor. 
      <p>By 1813, he had left the city as only the address of his son, <a href="pedox571.html">Peter 
        P. Dox</a>, represented the family in the first <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA3&dq=%22dox&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22dox=false">city 
        directory</a>. In November 1815, that son, Peter P. Dox, died and Peter 
        senior attended the funeral from Peter P.'s house on North Market Street. 
        All of his other children were buried in central New York. 
      <p>"Captain" Peter Dox died in November 1831. The <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany09munsuoft#page/236/mode/2up">newspaper</a> 
        notice stated that "he was born in Albany in 1742, saw the struggle that 
        was made in the old French and Indian war, and was actively engaged in 
        the war of the revolution." At that time, he was eighty-nine years old 
        and a resident of Hopeton, Yates County. He is said to have been living 
        at the residence of his son, <a href="http://ontario.nygenweb.net/DitoDzsurnamefamilysketch.htm">Abraham 
        Dox</a>, and is <a href="http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/QUEBEC-RESEARCH/2006-08/1155154108">said</a> 
        to have been buried in the Woodlawn cemetery in Elmira.</p>
