<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick De Ridder</strong></a> was born in January 1697. He was the son of <a href="evdridder7830.html">Evert</a> and <a href="../vn/anvness.html">Anna Van Ness</a> De Ridder. He grew up a large family of a one-time Albany schoolteacher and property owner who was living in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck at the time of Hendrick's birth.

<p>In 1715, Hendrick and his brother were privates in a Hendrick <a href="../vr/hvr5053.html">V</a>an Rensselaer's <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>This individual was an Albany resident who was appointed firemaster in the third ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">1729</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#7836">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>By 1726, he had married a woman named Anna (perhaps <a href="../vn/vness.html">Van Ness</a>) when they witnessed the first of several Albany baptisms. Beginning in October 1731, five of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Two of those children were buried there during the late 1730s.

<p>"<a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>endrick Ruyter" of Albany County was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Aj8GAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA486&lpg=PA486&dq=%22hendrick+ruyter%22+%22john+de+peyster%22&source=bl&ots=5W-1aiCYgY&sig=-gfV5MTelEHpu7dAA4fzb_WHUbE&hl=en&ei=saohTv6rOMjZgAep5rm-Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22hendrick%20ruyter%22%20%22john%20de%20peyster%22&f=false">dead</a> by March 1751 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were granted on his estate.</p>
