<strong>Anna Dorothea Drayer</strong></a> was the daughter of the Danish ancestry adventurer <a href="anddrayer.html">Andries Drayer</a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">D</a>rawyer) and <a href="../vs/gerrvschaick.html">Gerritje Van Schaick</a> - daughter of a prominent <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> pioneer.

<p>Her father was employed by the Dutch and was placed in command when Albany became <i>Willemstadt</i> in 1673. He later took his family and returned to Europe where he is said to have died in 1686. His widow then came back to New York with her family - which included Anna who probably was born in Denmark. "Johanna" was admitted to the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in New York City in February 1700. 

<p>In 1708, Anna Dorothea <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=idgUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205&dq=%22dorothea+dreyer%22&source=bl&ots=c4-DhWr8AE&sig=tgLp7UyTut8g_2qR8tcuUOgfYts&hl=en&ei=Jl4JS9KMMdXAlAfql-SEBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22dorothea%20dreyer%22&f=false">married</a> Reverend <a href="../b/tbarclay.html">Thomas Barclay</a> and took up residence at his <a href="../../stpeters.html">p</a>arsonage in Albany. Three of her four sons born between 1712 and 1720 became prominent figures in eighteenth century New York.
			  
<p>By the 1720s, Thomas Barclay's physical and mental health were in serious decline. Deteoriating throughout, he died in 1726 leaving widow Anna to raise the Barclay children.

<p>Three of her sons became prominent residents of colonial New York. <a href="../b/hebarclay.html">Henry</a> was a notable missionary and cleric. <a href="../b/andbarclay.html">Andrew</a> was a Manhattan-based merchant. <a href="../b/jobarclay.html">John</a>, the youngest, became the first <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany under the new State of New York in 1777. Perhaps, she spent her remaining years in one of their comfortable homes. 

<p>However, her name has not been found in the <a href="../../cbr.html">co</A>mmunity-based records encountered so far. We seek information on her later life and passing.
