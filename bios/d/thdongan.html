<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Dongan</strong></a> was the first royal governor of New York. Although he <a href="#never">may not have spent</a> more than a night in Albany, his interest and patronage were critical to the formation and initial development of the city of Albany. He still is <a href="http://donganfeis.org/">celebrated</a> locally and <a href="http://famousdaily.com/history/governor-dongan-charters-albany-ny.html">beyond</a> as Albany's first great <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> politician.

<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/people/thdongan.jpg" align=left border=1 width=175 height=275 vspace=2 hspace=4 alt="rendering of Governor Thomas Dongan"></a> As most of his life is beyond the <a href="../../criteria.html">scope</a> of our active concern, <a href="../../na/na.html">br</a>iefly, Dongan was born in County Kildare, Ireland in 1634. He was the son of a member of the Irish Parliament and went with his family into exile in France following the overthrown of King Charles I. There he joined a French regiment and, by 1674, had risen to the rank of Colonel. He returned to England in 1678 and was favored with military and governmental appointments through the agency of James Stuart - formerly a fellow officer in France and the brother of King Charles II. 

<p>Stuart also was the Duke of York and sent Colonel Dongan to America in 1682 to serve as governor of his province of New York. Dongan was granted tracts of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> on Staten Island, where he later built a mansion, and elsewhere in New York colony. 

<p>As proprietary and then royal governor of New York, Dongan played a key role in the settlement of <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> which he first authorized in 1683. <a href="../../charter.html#lithgow"><img src="../../images/jpg/na/dongan/lithgowdongan.jpg" align=right border=1 width=300 vspace=2 hspace=4 alt="The Dongan Charter"></a>That same year, he set up New York's first representative assembly; granted the Van Rensselaers a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">royal patent</a> in 1684; established New York and <a href="../../charter.html">Albany</a> as <a href="../../earlycity.html">cities</a> in 1686; and proved to be an able provincial leader until he was replaced when King James was removed from the throne later in the decade.

<p>After his years as governor, Dongan then fell back on his Staten Island estate called "Castletowne." Perhaps he never <a href="https://archive.org/stream/thomasdongannewy00wils/thomasdongannewy00wils_djvu.txt">married</a>. He is said to have returned to England in 1691. On the death of his brother in 1698, he succeeded to the title of "Earl of Limerick". Still plagued by family debt, Dongan was poor when he died in London in December 1715 at the age of eighty-two.

<p>As New York's last proprietary and first royal governor, Thomas Dongan literally put Albany on the colonial map by granting the community with about 500 residents a <a href="../../charter.html">city charter</a>. He is remembered today in many ways including the naming of a cross street in the old city in his honor.

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Thomas Dongan 
        has no CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> 
        seeks only to place this individual in his Albany context. His greater 
        life has been the subject of much exposition. He has become a legendary 
        figure. Begin with his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dongan,_2nd_Earl_of_Limerick">Wikipedia</a> 
        biography and the sources cited therein. Online documents relating to 
        him can be accessed via <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=dongan%20AND%20mediatype%3Atexts"><i>Internet 
        Archive</i></a>. Overlooked for the most part these days is Thomas P. 
        Phelan's <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/thomas-dongan-colonial-governor-of-new-york-1683-1688-by-thomas-p-phelan/oclc/21535022"><i>Thomas 
        Dongan : colonial governor of New York, 1683-1688</i></a> (New York, 1933), 
        which I read as a young student of colonial New York. Other offerings 
        exist. None are sufficiently impartial! Publication of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Dongan_Papers_Files_of_the_Provincia.html?id=PzYR1Mq6gwIC"><i>Dongan 
        Papers</i></a> - beginning in 1993, is a first step in demystifying the 
        pivotal tenure of New York's first royal governor. 
        <p><a name=never></a> However, his so-called visits to Albany beginning in 1683 are noted in a number of expositions. A number of the provincial governors came upriver (sometimes even annually) to deliver presents and otherwise "negotiate" with the Indians whom royal authorities valued as allies against the French. We hope to e able to document any visit Dongan made to Albany.

        <p><a name=port></a><b>Portrait</b>: We have found no authentic (that means done 
          by an artist who actually met the subject) likeness of Thomas Dongan. 
          Additionally, bloody little descriptive material exists to inspire any 
          memorial paintings. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Dongan,_2nd_Earl_of_Limerick#mediaviewer/File:Thomas_Dongan,_2nd_Earl_of_Limerick.jpg">engraving</a> 
          probably based on a reminiscent drawing is most often seen in print 
          and other media. I'm guessing that it is a 19th century rendering. Phelan's 
          biography notes that it is in the collection of the New-York Historical 
          Society and was found in his home on Staten Island. However, I no longer 
          can bring myself to use it. The <a href="http://www.andrewcusack.com/2006/01/16/thomas-dongan/">scenario 
          shown here</a> represents Dongan the creator of counties and cities. 
          Its history is not clear but it appears to part of a larger mural presentation 
          at the Nassau County <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hragvartanian/sets/72157604459751498">legislative 
          building</a> at Mineola, Long Island. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg"   height=10 border=1 alt="biography in-progress"></a>
