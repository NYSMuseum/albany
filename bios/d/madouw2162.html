<strong>Maria Douw</strong></a> was born in October 1760. She was the youngest child in the large family of <a href="vopdouw2234.html">Volkert P.</a> and <a href="adp7822.html">Anna De Peyster</a> Douw. Her father was a businessman who served as mayor of Albany during the 1760s. She grew up at landmark family  homes  in Albany and across the Hudson at "<a href="douw.html#wol">Wolvenhook</a>."

<p>In January 1782, she married Revolutionary army veteran <a href="../t/jodpte4891.html">John De Peyster Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany Dutch church. The union may have produced only two children.

<p>These Ten Eycks made their home on lower <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> where John was a businessman and official who was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1788. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4891">1790</a>, their home was attended by four slaves. During the early 1800s, widow Maria <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#1810">freed</a> her slaves.

<p>Maria lost her husband when John died  in 1798. The thirty seven-year-old widow lived on as the head of the houshold in their 82 State Street home with her son, also named <a href="../t/jodpte4893.html">John DePeyster Ten Eyck</a>, for the next twenty years. 

<p>Maria Douw Ten Eyck died in March 1818. She had lived almost fifty-eight years.</p>
