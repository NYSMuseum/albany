<P><a href="#sources"><b>Pomp</b></a> was the <a href="#servant">servant</a> of <a href="../v/mavisscher4062.html">Matthew Visscher</a> and a central figure in the conspiracy to fix blame for the <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html">fire</a> that destroyed a core portion of the city of Albany in November 1793.</p>


<p>According to <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html#pomp">traditional sources</a>, Pomp was probably born about 1777. It is supposed that he came from New York. In January 1788, he would have been eleven years old when he was <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html#purchase">purchased</a> by Visscher, a young attorney and important Revolutionary operative. He was characterized as an "honest, trustworthy", and "faithful servant" but not considered a bright or even intelligent boy. As he grew to manhood, Pomp became "more independent but not impudent." His affinity for "negro wenches" made him less reliable and more indolent. He stole from his <a href="../f/lyfryer2220.html">mistress</a> in order to purchase fashionable or fopish clothing. More details regarding his life and exploits <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html#pomp">later appeared</a> in an Albany newspaper article.</p>

<p>Matthew Visscher died in August of 1793 - leaving Pomp mostly on his own. Less than three months later, Pomp, then about sixteen years old, would be caught up in a series of actions that ultimately would cost him his life!</p>

<p>He was implicated in the conspiracy that lead to the <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html">burning</a> of a core portion of the city in November 1793. Although exonerated by the actual arsonists, and after great efforts by many of Albany's leading citizens to have him spared, on April 11, 1794, the Albany paper reported that "Pomp, a negro convicted of arson, and several times respited, was hung; and his dying confessions were sold at No. 2 Pearl street."

<FONT size=-1><b>Servant</b> is a term enountered in sources that we take to mean "slave" - that is a person with no civil rights or legal standing except as the property of an owner. Mostly, the term means a slave-for-life of African ancestry.<p></p>
