<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Teunise</strong></a> probably was 
        born about 1660. He was the son of Teunis J. and Sara Denys Van Woert. 
        He was called Jacob Teunise (Van Woert) and should not be confused with 
        <a href="../vv/javvorst6427.html">Jacobus Van Vorst</a> - an older Albany resident. 
      <p>About 1683, he married <a href="../g/cagroesbeck3266.html">Catharina 
        Cl. Groesbeck</a>. Their only <a href="clvwoert2624.html">child</a> was 
        christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 
        June 1684. In October 1690, he married <a href="../l/anloock5932.html">Anna 
        Loockermans</a>, the widow of Adam Winne. By 1704, that marriage produced 
        ten more children. He was a member of the Albany church and a regular 
        baptism sponsor. 
      <p>In May 1681, a lot <a href="../../loc/northend.html">beyond</a> the north 
        gate of Albany was conveyed to Jacob Teunise and a number of other <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemakers</a>. 
        In July, he took title to a house and lot in Albany. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#073">1697</a>, his home was configured 
        on the Albany census. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">1701</a>, 
        he signed a community-based petition to the royal governor. 
      <p>In March 1707, he was identified as a "retailer of strong liquors" in 
        the city of Albany and was cited for not having paid the fee for a liquor 
        license. 
      <p>After witnessing a baptism in October 1715, his name dropped from <a href="../../cbr.html">Albany 
        rolls</a>. 
      <p>Jacob Teunise Van Woert died in July 1730 and was buried in the churchyard. 
      <p>Perhaps he was the "Jacob Tuenisse Van Woert" who was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=%22teunisse+albany&id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&ots=wwdCeXsdiv#v=onepage&q&f=false">referenced</a> 
        as the former owner of land (near the Van Rensselaer's ferry) held by 
        Jacob Van Woert, Jr. in 1768.</p>
