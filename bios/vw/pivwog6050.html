<strong>Pieter Van Woggelum</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/ts.html">aka</a> "Soegemakelyk" and "Pieter Adriensz") was in New Netherland by the 1650s. Pieter Adriensz had a wooden house in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> in 1654. We seek defining information on his origins and earlier life.</p>

<p>He was married and had at least three children who seem to have been born in Holland. In 1691, an "Indian boy" lived with him.

<p>He was called an innkeeper and also a skipper. In March <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">1684</a>, he owed two years of back taxes in Albany but was then in New York. 

<p>In August 1684, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nkHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=stavast+albany&source=bl&ots=-hESn-M2AZ&sig=GsRTzEI7feiHepXAd2ecCJLs59o&hl=en&ei=c2VoS_rFApLM8QbcsuGtBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=stavast%20albany&f=false">purchased</a> a house and lot along the river from <a href="../s/cljstav.html">Claes Janse Stavast</a>.

<p> In <a href="../../census1697.html#036">1697</a>, his home was configured on the Albany census. Two years later, he joined with his neighbors in swearing <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6050">allegiance</a> to the king of England. Earlier, he was identified as one of the owners of <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/vanwoggelum.html">lots</a> in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.

<p>Pieter Van Woggelum appeared before the Albany court in May 1701. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his first ward house was valued on the Albany assessment roll. After that, his name dropped from Albany annals.</p>

The life of Pieter Van Woggelum is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6050. His name is encountered in many forms in the historical record. So <a href="../../res/sp.html">varied</a> are the spellings and references that he almost defies historical description.
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from
