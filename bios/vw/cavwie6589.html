      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Casparus Van Wie</strong></a> was born in December         1742. He was a middle son in the large family of <a href="hevwie.html">Hendrick         Jr.</a> and <a href="../w/cawaldron641.html">Catharina Waldron</a> Van Wie. 
        He grew up on a farm located south of Albany. 
      <p>In April 1766, Casparus married <a href="../w/jawinne.html">Jannetie Winne</a> at that Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, they were both identified as single people of the colony of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. By 1780, the marriage had produced produced five children.

<p>He appears to have lived in or beyond the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany in a developing area that soon would become known as <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#6589">1766</a>, he joined his Albany neighbors and two older brothers as well in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty.

<p>During the 1760s and '70s, his West Bank Rensselaerswyck property was valued on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>.


<p>In 1767, he was a private in a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. During the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">War</a> for Independence, he served in the militia. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6589">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6589">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for Watervliet.

<p>In 1815, the city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">Directory</a> listed him at 99 North <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. The fact that he was not found on the earlier directories could mean that his home came into Albany with the expansion of the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city boundary</a> north in 1814.  In 1818, his unmarried and middle-aged daughters (Agnes and Rachel) would be listed in the Directory in North Albany.

<p>Casparus Van Wie lost his wife in August 1815. He died in March 1818 and was buried from the Dutch church. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in July. He had lived seventy-five years.</p>
