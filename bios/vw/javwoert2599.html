<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Van Woert</strong></a> was born in January 1724. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Th</a>us, he would have been the first son of Jacob and Hendrickie Oothout Van Woert. He grew up in a <a href="http://users.crocker.com/~jcamp/jvw.html">large</a> Albany family.

<p>His wife was Albany County native Elizabeth Fort. Two sons were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1750 and 1754. Elizabeth was buried in May 1756.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#112">1756</a>, "Jacob Van Worst" was identified as a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> on a list of Albany householders <a href="../../res/sp.html">made</a> by the British <a href="../../7yw.html">army</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2599">1763</a>, the name of "Jacob Van Voort" appeared on a list of Albany County freeholders.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> and 1767, his property in the first ward was accorded substantial assessments. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2599">1779</a>, his property in the same <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> location was valued comparable to that of city <a href="../../econ/comec.html#mer">businessmen</a>. At the same time, his first ward <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#javw">lot</a> received a more modest assessment.

<p>In November 1768, his land near the Van Rensselaer (north) <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=%22teunisse+albany&id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&ots=wwdCeXsdiv#v=onepage&q&f=false">referenced</a> in the city records. It formerly had belonged to <a href="javwoert2592.html">Jacob Teunise</a>.
  

<p>In his fifties by the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">out</a>break of hostilities in 1775, perhaps Jacob Van Woert played a more passive role in the ensuing drama. However, afterwards, a "Jacob Van Woordt" was granted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2599">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. </p>

<p>In January 1782, his account was paid from the city treasury. However, by 1788, the name of this Albany mainliner had dropped from the community-based record. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his later life and passing.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. He sometimes would be known as Jacob J. or Jacob Van Woert, Jr. His same-named son (who married in 1777) gives us pause in the assignment of qualitative information.
