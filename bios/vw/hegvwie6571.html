<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Gerritse</b></a> may have been a resident of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> in the mid-1650s. Or, he may have been the "Hendrick Geritse Van Wie"  who was transported to Rensselaerswyck in 1664. In any case, he was the patriarch of the <a href="vwie.html">Van Wie</a> family of <a href="../../familynames.html">early Albany</a>.</p>

<p>No <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iant of his name appeared on the lists of Albany area fur traders dated <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">1660</a>.   

<p>He was married to one <a href="../../res/sp.html">Eytie</a> (Feytje) Ariaans - the mother of his children. By the 1680s, they were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. </p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#126">1679</a>, a "Hendrick Gerritse" was listed among the Albany householders living within the stockade. In <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#fb">1683</a>, a church subscription list called him a "farmer below." In 1687, he was identified as an Albany merchant.

<p>During the 1670s, he built a <a href="http://home.inreach.com/burghart/vanwie.html">house</a> south of Albany on the Hudson at what became "Van Wie's Point." 

<p>Hendrick Gerritse filed a <a href="../../wills/willhevwie.html">will</a> in 1690. It mentioned his wife and son Gerrit. Hendrick Gerritse Van Wie died in 1692 and his widow re-married shortly thereafter.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Hendrick Gerritse <a href="vwie.html">Van Wie</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6571. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.  <a href="http://www.johnhoyt.com/h-linage/g161.html#I3233">Online</a> family resources are both interesting and confusing! Because he was known as "Hendrick Gerritse" and several other individuals were so identified at the time, we have been conservative in assigning historical information on "Hendrick Geritse" to his life!</font></p>
