<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Rutger Jacobse</strong></a> probably was the founder of the Van Woert (Schoenderwoert) family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and Albany. He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in South Holland in 1615 or 1621. He arrived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in 1637. He probably was the brother of Teunis Jacobse.

<p>He began as an indentured farmhand and became a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a>, miller, and skipper. Although he did engage in the fur trade, his name was not on the <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">lists</a> of principal fur traders operating from Beverwyck in 1660.

<p>He was an early settler of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and served as a <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">magistrate</a> during the 1650s. He participated in the building of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1656.

<p>In 1646, he married Tryntje (Catharina) Jans van Breestede in New Amsterdam. The marriage produced several children. His <a href="mgtvwoert2613.html">daughter</a> married <a href="../b/jjbleecker2.html">Jan Janse Bleecker</a>

<p>He is said to have patented land on Long Island and on Constapel Island in the Hudson. He owned property in New Amsterdam as well.  

<p>Rutger Jacobse Van Woert died at Kingston in December 1665.
