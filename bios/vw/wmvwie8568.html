<strong>Willem Van Wie</strong></a> was born in October 1740. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents Hendrick and Catharina Waldron Van Wie. During the 1760s, he served alongside his brothers in a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>In May 1767, he married a somewhat younger <a href="../l/janlansing3435.html">Jannetje Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their marriage licence identified him as an Albany County farmer. A few months later, the first of their six children was christened at their Albany church.


<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#8568">1766</a>, he again joined his brothers and more than ninety others in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. From that time on, he was an Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">mainstay</a> - setting up a modest <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8568">home</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>, just above South Pearl. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8568">1790</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household included seven family members and a slave. In <a href="../../census1800.html#8568">1800</a>, seven family members still were accounted for in his household. In time, he  acquired additional property on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he was a listed as a private in the city militia company and once posted a <a href="../../cddc.html">bond</a> for his neighbor's good behavior. Otherwise, his name has not been found on wartime rolls.  

<p>Willem Van Wie earned his living as a carpenter all the way into his seventies - sometimes doing work for the city government. He seems to have held no public positions.  

<p>Willem Van Wie died in July 1816 and was buried in the church plot. He had lived seventy-six years. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in August. His widow lived until 1821.</p>
