<strong>Pieter Van Wie</strong></a> was born in February 1737. He was the eldest son in the large family of Hendrick and Catharina Waldron Van Wie. He grew up on the family farm located <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">south</a> of Albany.

<p>During the 1760s, his name and those of his brothers appeared on the roster of an East Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. However, he was not included on either of the existing assessment <a href="../../sources.html#uny">rolls</a> for the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> during that period.

<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#pvw"">1766</a>, he joined two younger brothers in signing a community-based constitution for the Albany Sons of Liberty.

<p>He was thirty-seven in December 1774, when he married Ebbetje (Abigail) Vandenbergh at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1780,  three children were christened in the Albany church. His will mentioned two additional offspring.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779pe">1777</a>, he signed a number of petitions for the return of prisoners. At that time, he was called a resident of Albany County. In May of <a href="../../cddc.html">1780</a>, he posted a bond of a hundred pounds guaranteeing good behavior for a neighbor. At that time, he was identified as a farmer of the West District of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. Afterwards he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Third Regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html#links">militia</a>.

<p>Following his death, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> was recorded on July 25, 1788. It named his wife co-executor and Abigail and five children as heirs. His wife was identified as head of their Watervliet household in <a href="../../census1790.html#abvw">1790</a>. Pieter Van Wie had lived about fifty years. His widow's Bethlehem household was configured on the census in 1800. His son, Gerrit, became a prominent resident of Glenmont.
