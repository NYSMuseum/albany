<P>In <a href="../../census1790.html#hevw">1790</a>, the household of <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry Van Waggoner</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Waggoner) was enumerated on the Albany city census of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. On that survey alone, no fewer than <a href="../w/phwag.html">three</a> (and three more in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#w">W</a>atervliet) similarly named householders were represented - none of whose surnames were <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelled</a> consistently. We know that Henry was an Albany resident at that time. This offering seeks to <a href="../../res/context.html">focus</a> on his life as an Albany resident.

<p>A number of similarly named individuals are at-risk in New York, New Jersey, and at least as far as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0RpcjJQBm6AC&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=Doctor+henry+Waggoner&source=bl&ots=aU07EYgqf4&sig=Fg1Zm2oWdQ9JzsW7Drxzwit_ozQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjduLDM--TQAhVKVWMKHRS2CLQ4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=snippet&q=waggoner&f=false">Virginia</a> and perhaps <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Henry-Waggoner-I/6000000005360098876">beyond</a> during the second half of the eighteenth century. We seek defining information on Albany's Henry Van Waggoner's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>References to a number of similarly named individuals appear on various New York <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">military rolls</a> for the American Revolution. However, the surname appears to be more closely connected to New Jersey and perhaps Ulster County.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#drvw">1788</a>, the house and property of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Doctor Wagonner" was valued on the first ward assessment in roughly the same place as his census listing two yours later. That would have been up the State Street hill or on one of the connecting streets.

<p>In January 1790, a son (Albertus) was <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part8.html">christened</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> to "Hendrik V. Wageningen and Annatje Land man." That appears to have been the sole reference to him in the extant records of Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>After that, we have not encountered additional information on this subject in available community-based resources or in our most recent sweep of the Internet. With so many critical elements still a mystery, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany resident Henry <a href="../../res/sp.html">Van 
        Waggoner</a>. <br>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. We are uncertain of his surname with many possibilities from Wagner to Van Waggonnen.
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="../../res/irs.html">Online resources</a>: Perhaps <a href="http://njgsbc.org/files/BCFamilies/BCFam-VanWagenen.pdf">this document</a> represents this individual's family origins. However, a number of other distinct pasts are at-risk. </div>
