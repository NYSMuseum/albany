<P>Family-based resources <a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Van_Wie-31">tell us</a> that  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit Van Wie</strong></a> was born about 1678. He was the son of Van Wie patriarch <a href="hegvwie6571.html">Hendrick Gerritse</a> and Eytie (Feytje) Ariaans Van Wie. He <a href="http://minerdescent.com/2010/08/16/hendrick-gerritse-van-wie/#400">appears</a> to have been the eldest of at least nine children born prior to 1690. A variety of resources also have referred to his individual as "Gerrit Hendrickse."

      <p>Children were acknowledged and considered but not named (perhaps excepting 
        Gerrit) in the <a href="../../wills/willhevwie.html">will</a> filed by 
        his father - probably in 1690. Gerrit's mother was named as primary heir. 
        Hendrick Gerrritse died shortly thereafter and his widow remarried.
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#gevw">1697</a>, "Gerrit van Wey" was alone in his <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck home.

<p>In November 1698, "Gerrit Hendriksz Van Wyen, [married] <a href="../c/agconyn.html">Agnietje Conyn</a>" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, the partners were identified as single people "living here."  By 1703, three children had been christened at the church where the parents were occasional baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=98k6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA471&lpg=PA471&dq=%22gerrit+van+wie%22&source=bl&ots=Eg-XxeuXNY&sig=MSqqzVJp7gbnrNeuVqWWNQefvK4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dmhwVYnaI67jsASNtICgAg&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22gerrit%20van%20wie%22%20&f=false">1715</a>, his name appeared on a roster of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html"> militia</a> company commanded by Hendrick Van Rensselaer. Most of his fellow militiamen lived in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> on both sides of the river.

<p>Perhaps he was the Gerrit Van Wie <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=f7a2J6EIrTcC&pg=PA245&lpg=PA245&dq=%22Colloney+RenselaersWyck%22&source=bl&ots=FaWOTYgb1S&sig=s_yk2sp-pDwU-xqVQZFcaILn9B0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OxtvVaykAqLgsASR84GIBw&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Colloney%20RenselaersWyck%22&f=false">listed</a> with other family members on rolls of freeholders in Rensselaerswyck in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6593">1742</a>. 

      <p>Gerrit Van Wie <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=%22gerret+van+wie%27s+wife%22&source=bl&ots=ktvbdH7JwR&sig=xxV2W1XOQCwOJvBREsVk2U1JUQM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=gWZwVcD_NYXfsAT69oGAAQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22gerret%20van%20wie's%20wife%22&f=false">lost</a> 
        his wife in March 1746. He died later in the year and was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_opPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA243&dq=%2220+gerrit+van+wie%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0mZwVebVDLLbsATfuYOIBg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%2220%20gerrit%20van%20wie%22&f=false">buried</a> 
        in December 1746. This son of one of the early settlers of Beverwyck lived 
        most if not all of his life in the Albany hinterland - most <a href="vwie.html#point">likely</a> on the family property on Van Wie's Point.</p>
