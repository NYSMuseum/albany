<strong>Hendrick Van Wie, Jr. </strong></a> was born in June 1703. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents Gerrit and Agnietie (Anna) Conyn Van Wie. Both his parents died in 1746. He also was referred to as "Hendrick G. Van Wie." 

      <p>In October 1732, he married Albany native <a href="../w/cawaldron641.html">Catharina 
        Waldron</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1754, their eleven children were christened in Albany. 
      <p>Like many members of his family, these Van Wies appear to have lived in Rensselaerswyck. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#hvw">1742</a>, his name was on a list of Rensselaerswyck freeholders along with those of his father and several kin. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his holdings in the West Manor were valued for taxes. He probably lived <a href="../../im/im1767.html#6">south</a> of Albany near the farms of other family members.

<p>In June 1765, sixty-two-year-old Hendrick Van Wie, Jr. was interviewed regarding the supposed will of <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html">Joachim Staats</a>.

<p>This Hendrick Van Wie probably died sometime thereafter.
