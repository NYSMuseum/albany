<P>The story of the <a href="#sources"> <strong>Van Wie</strong></a> family of early Albany begins with the arrival of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer called <a href="hegvwie6571.html">Hendrick Gerritse</a> during the mid-seventeenth century. His farm along the river south of Albany in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> became the <a href="http://minerdescent.com/2010/08/16/hendrick-gerritse-van-wie/">focal point</a> for family activities that before 1800 included a number of residents of the city of Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#gevw">1697</a>, only the Rensselaerswyck household of sole surviving son "<a href="gevwie.html">Gerrit Van Wey</a>" was configured on the countywide census of households.

<p>By the end of the seventeenth century, this family (at least with Albany) had adopted the <a href="../../res/sp.html">surname</a> "Van Wie" perhaps in an effort to distinguish them from the regional (and more amorphous) "<a href="../g/gerritse.html">Gerritse</a>" family. Thus, we strive to not confuse them in the assignment of qualitative information.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, no Van Wies were listed among the freeholders in the city of Albany. At that time, <a href="hevwie.html">Hendrick Wan Wye [Jr.]</a> and the names of Gerrit and Jan Van Wie were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KWtAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA373&lpg=PA373&dq=wie&source=bl&ots=XY4mX44MNe&sig=ukBMTK3ThDE_4QxEWeELJCbbWxA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GRpOVZH4A_eJsQSJ4YDQDQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=wie&f=false">included</a> among the freeholders of Rensselaerswyck. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#rw">1742</a>, the three Van Wies were listed among the freeholders living in Rensselaerswyck.

<a name=point>
<p>By the mid-eighteenth century, the family would be in its third and fourth generations in America and was well established in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. Although most descendants named "Van Wie" would cluster around the "<a href="#vwp">Van Wie's Point</a>" homestead, family members also were interwoven into the city's social fabric.

<p>A <a href="../../sources.html#uny">published comp</a>ilation of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">survey lists</a> from Albany County covering the mid-1760s provided the names of almost two dozen different Van Wies - all of them connected to activities and/or holdings in the Manor. However, at virtually the same time (early in 1766), the consecutive signatures of brothers <a href="pivwie.html">Pieter Van Wie</a>, <a href="wmvwie8568.html">Willem Van Wie</a>, and <a href="cavwie6589.html">Casparus Van Wie</a> were included among the 94 signers of a <a href="../../solconst.html">Constitution</a> for the Albany Sons of Liberty. Virtually every name on that earliest counting of Albany dissidents identified a city resident.

<p>In <a href="../../im/im1767.html">1767</a>, a map fixed the location of the residents of Rensselaerswyck living around Albany. Three <a href="../../im/im1767.html#6">Van Wie households</a> were clustered along the river south of the city.

      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6576">1790</a>, two "Van Wee" named households 
        were <a href="../../census1790.html#8568">configured</a> on the city census 
        and ten more in surrounding <a  href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>. 
        a decade <a href="../../census1800.html">later</a>, two Van Wie households 
        remained in the city. 
      <p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22wie%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22wie&f=false"><img src="../../images/jpg/1813vanwie.jpg" width=350 height=110 align=left border=2 alt="Van Wies in 1813"></a> The first city directory published in 1813, identified four Van Wie households living in Albany's first ward. Two homes, including a roominghouse kept by Gerrit W. Van Wie, were located on <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1820</a>, six Van Wie addresses were listed in various settled locations in the city.


<p>In March 1869, a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NZx3gehXILIC&pg=PA48&lpg=PA48&dq=%22van+wie's+point%22+history&source=bl&ots=DMB7QoaJRB&sig=nQfR9s3QXdYjR9EBUDj8CLuSr88&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YwPyU6erJo_gsATjyoLAAQ&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22van%20wie's%20point%22%20history&f=false">newspaper obituary</a> marked the passing of 93-year-old Catherine Van Wie Quackenbush - last of the Van Wie's Point family.

<p>Located off of Western Avenue in Westmere, the suburban street named <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22van+wie%22+albany">Van Wie Terrace</a> also commemorates the family today. </p>
