<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Claes (Nicholas) Van Woert</strong></a> was 
        born in June 1684. <a href="../../res/sp.html">He</a> was the only child born to the marriage of Albany 
        natives <a href="javwoert2592.html">Jacob Teunise</a> and <a href="../g/cagroesbeck3266.html">Catharina 
        Groesbeck</a> Van Woert. His mother died while he was a young boy. Jacob 
        Teunise re-married and was the father of ten more children. 
      <p>In December 1708, Claes married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        native <a href="../b/dibarheit.html">Dirkje Barheit</a> at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1724, the marriage had produced 
        seven children who were christened in the Albany church where, over the 
        next two decades, both parents were occasional baptism sponsors. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2624">1709</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> house was accorded a modest assessment. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1710">1710</a>, 
        he was appointed constable. The next year, he was named high constable. 
        In 1715 and again in 1724, he served as firemaster in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2624">1720</a> and in 
        <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2624">1742</a>, his name was included 
        among the freeholders living in the first ward. In December 1734, he was 
        one of those paid by the city government for making deliveries. 
      <p>Claes Van Woert was last heard from in 1748 when he and Dirkje witnessed 
        a baptism in Albany.</p>
