      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick Van Wie</strong></a> was born in January 
        1747. He was the son of <a href="hevwie.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../w/cawaldron641.html">Catharina 
        Waldron</a> Van Wie. He grew up in a large family on a farm located <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">south</a> 
        of Albany. 
      <p>About 1772, he married Albany native <a href="../m/mamartin6577.html">Mary Martin</a>. By 1790, the marriage had produced six or seven children - all of whom were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>His parents probably died during the 1770s and he seems to have set up his own household in Albany. HIs home appears to have been located near the city hall. Beginning In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">1775</a>, he was paid by the city council for cleaning and other chores.

<p> In July, he was one of ten Albany <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenters</a> engaged by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> to go to Ticonderoga and perform work ordered by <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">General Schuyler</a>. Several times identified as a <a href="../../cddc.html">carpenter</a>, he owned a lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>.  In 1780, he posted a bond guaranteeing the good behavior of one George Rodgers.

<p>In September 1785, he was identified as the <a href="../../loc/jail.html">jailor</a> and was permitted to take enough stone from the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> to build an oven in the yard next to the <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">court house</a>.

<p>In 1790, his first ward household was <a href="../../census1790.html#6576">configured</a> on the city census and probably was located between Court Street and the river. However, his real and personal property were not considered on the comprehensive <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#859">assessment roll</a> for 1788.

<p>Hendrick Van Wie died in October 1795 and was buried from his church. Afterwards, his widow carried on in their Fox Street home with the help of <a href="../../poor.html">alms</a> from the church. Widow Mary Van Wie died in 1801.
