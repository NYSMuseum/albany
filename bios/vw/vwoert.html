<P>At least part of the <a href="#sources"> <strong>Van Woert</strong></a> family of early Albany was descended from <a href="rjvwoert2637.html">Rutger Jacobse Van Schoendwoert</a> who came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the 1630s. His <a href="mgtvwoert2613.html">daughter</a> married city father <a href="../b/jjbleecker2.html">Jan Janse Bleecker</a> and was the matriarch of the Albany Bleecker family. The Van Woert family maintained a small but consistent presence in the city of Albany for more than a century.

<p>Until his death in 1730, shoemaker <a href="javwoert2592.html">Jacob Teunise</a> was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#073">mainstay</a> who raised a large family following his second marriage in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany.

<p>Tailor <a href="anvwoert2405.html">Andries Van Woert</a> was counted among an emerging <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> enclave of <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">cloth</a> craftsmen during the middle decades of the eighteenth century.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, only placeman <a href="clvwoert2624.html">Nicholas Van Woert</a> appeared on a city freeholders list. However, <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#rw">four</a> other Van Woerts were <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#rw">listed</a> from <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck. By that time, a part of the family was beginning to cluster near what later would be called Van Woert Street on land <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">leased</a> from the Van Rensselaers whose country <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">seat</a> stood out between the Van Woerts and the river.

<p>His son, <a href="hevwoert2585.html">Henry</a>, began to make the transition to Albany's <a href="../../econ/comec.html">commercial</a> class but mainly was the only Van Woert left within the actual city.

<p>At the same time, Van Woert daughters married into successful Albany families and also with prominent newcomers including skipper <a href="../f/jofryer8135.html">John Fryer</a> and carpenter <a href="../e/theasterly7911.html">Thomas Easterly</a>.

<p>In 1813, the first city directory <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22van+woert%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22van%20woert%22&f=false">listed</a> a Henry Van Woert and two Van Woert widows in city homes.

<p><a name=vrmh></a>Located near the site of the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Van Rensselaer Manor House</a>, Van Woert <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22van+woert+street%22&hl=en&rlz=1R2AURU_enUS500&prmd=imvnsb&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=g7VtUPzqC6-y0QGf-4HwDg&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1461&bih=524">Street</a> is named for the New Netherland era early Albany family who were residents of that area for several generations. The Van Woert family remains <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22van+woert%22+albany&hl=en&rlz=1R2AURU_enUS500&prmd=imvns&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=SLJtUNzQMefE0QHgs4CgBw&ved=0CAcQ_AUoATgK&biw=1600&bih=694">notable</a> in Albany and its environs today.</p>
