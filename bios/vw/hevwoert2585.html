<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Hendrick Van Woert</strong></a> was born in March 1747. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="anvwoert2405.html">Andries</a> and Elizabeth Vanderwerken Van Woert.

<p>In August 1773, he married newcomer <a href="../e/caeights2142.html">Catherine Eights</a>. By 1791, the marriage had produced eight children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Hendrick was a member. In 1805, he served on the church consistory.

<p>For several decades, Hendrick Van Woert was an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2585">mainstay</a>. His household was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#2585">census</a> and his holdings valued on first ward <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2585">assessment rolls</a>. A freeholder list from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a> identified him as a "gentleman."

<p>During the 1760s, he belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company and to the <a href="../../org/masonic.html#2585">Masonic Lodge</a>.
		
<p>At the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, he contributed to the American relief effort. In August 1775, he was <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">appointed</a> adjutant for the second battalion of the First Regiment of the New York Line. In July, he was promoted to Quartermaster. He also held the rank of lieutenant. 

<p>Hendrick Van Woert filed a will in October 1798. It identified his wife and four living children and noted real and personal property. They were accounted for in his household on the <a href="../../census1800.html#2585">census</a> in 1800. He died in February 1813 just shy of his sixty-fourth birthday. His widow lived on at 64 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Avenue</a>.
