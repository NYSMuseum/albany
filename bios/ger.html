<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Germans</strong></a> (those of Germanic origins or background) represented a significant part of the social fabric of early Albany and were present in the community from its <a href="../beverwyck.html">earliest days</a>. For our purposes, Germans are defined as those who came from or whose roots were in the geographic land known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania">Germania</a>."

<p>The cultural makeup of the <a href="../nnd.html">New Netherland Dutch</a> who first settled Albany's predecessor <a href="#nn">included</a> a number of more and or less historically visible individuals who might be defined of "Germanic" rather than "Dutch" heritage. Yes, we have made an "either-or" choice here. Some of these individuals assimilated and persisted in the community over the next generations. Others retained their ancestral cultural attributes publicly and mostly relocated to the Albany <a href="../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a> and beyond. <a name=pal></a> 

<p>Several thousand Germans came to New York in a stream of immigration during the first decades of the eighteenth century. They are widely known as <b>Palatine</b> Germans, Palatine Refugees, or simply as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Palatines">Palatines</a>. After stopping in New York City (some stayed in Manhattan), they were settled on both sides of the Hudson River (Germantown, German Camp) and in the Schoharie, and Mohawk Valleys.  Some became <a href="../na/rensselaerswyck.html">tenants</a> of the Van Rensselaers but these emigres were more likely to set down roots in the "greener outer pastures" of old <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. <a href="#however">However</a>, only a <a href="../na/na.html">few</a> early Albany <a href="#palres">residents</a> could trace their origins to that migration.

<p>First, our test for German strives to look past names (which are often the interpretation of the person who recorded the references) and focuses on defining references, language, and religion.

<p>If an individual stated that they were from Germany (or more specifically from a so-called German state), we tend to "loosely" categorize them as German. Next, if they were called "German" by a contemporary - official or private citizen, sometimes that works as well.

<p>Although a few Germans came from Calvinist or Catholic European backgrounds, German ancestry people mostly gravitated to the Albany <a href="../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. No doubt the German language they found there made that choice attractive.</p>
