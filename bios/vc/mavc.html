<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Van Cortlandt</b></a> was born in April of 1680. She was the fifth child born to Manhattan merchant and landholder Stephanus Van Cortlandt and his wife, <a href="../s/geerschuyler1726.html">Geertruy Schuyler</a> of Albany.</p>

<p>In October 1701, she married thirty-nine-year-old <a href="../vr/kvr5054.html">Kiliaen Van Rensselaer</a> at the New York Dutch church. By 1717, the marriage had produced ten children - all of whom were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>Married to the lord of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, Maria lived at the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a>. Kiliaen Van Rensselaer died there in 1719. Her husband's <a href="../../wills/willkvr5054.html">will</a> permitted her the use of his estate during her widowhood. If she re-married, Mary was allowed use of his property on <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a> and other Manor resources as well.</p>  


<p>In November 1728, she married Reverend <a href="../m/jomilne.html">John Milne<a/>, the new rector at St. Peter's Anglican church.</p>

<p>In 1744, Dr. Alexander Hamilton <a href="../../art/ham.html">called her</a> "an old, jolly fat Dutchwoman - mother to the <a href="../vr/stvr.html">patroon</a> att Albany." At that time the Milnes were living in New York. 

<p>In 1747, some of her holdings were described in the <a href="../../wills/willstvr.html">will</a> filed by her son. Maria Van Cortlandt Van Rensselaer Milne was no longer alive after June 1750!</p>
