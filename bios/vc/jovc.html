<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johanna Van Corlear</strong></a> was born during the spring of 1687. She was the daughter of <a href="bevc5336.html">Benomi</a> Van Corlear and his wife, <a href="../vd/elvdp6249.html">Elizabeth Vanderpoel</a> Van Corlaer. She grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of a multi-functional Albany resident who died in 1704.

<p>In 1708, Johanna married newcomer <a href="../r/jonrumney.html">Jonathan Rumney</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A son named <a href="../r/rorumney.html">Robert</a> was christened the following year. The marriage appears to have produced other children as well.

<p>As late as 1713, Rumney was listed on the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=JrgBAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA453&lpg=PA453&dq=%22jonath+rumney%22&source=bl&ots=MKxHE6H7oP&sig=2aHDMXbetdYQSGLIC-DH1WsMzKI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3XAFUNehPKfK0AHL3_DRCA&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22jonath%20rumney%22&f=false">rolls</a> of an Albany-based company of grenadiers. 

<p>Johanna lost her husband in September 1722. While maintaining some visible connection with the Albany Dutch church, widow Johanna otherwise was less prominent the community-based record. However, she probably remarried and relocated to New Jersey. What follows is of <a href="../../res/guess.html">less</a> certainty.

<p>On September 17, 1729, "Anna Corlaar" married "Nic. Groesbeek" after the posting of banns <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part3.html">at</a> the Albany Dutch church. No other information was included in the marriage register. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources <a href="http://awt.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=flakey&id=I101763621&ti=5542">chart</a> their relocation to New Jersey

<p>In November 1750, Johanna's mother, widow Elizabeth Van Corlear, filed her <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a>. It divided her estate and mentioned her daughter Johanna, calling her the wife of Albany <a href=http://worldconnect.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=mercer&id=I14411"">native</a> and widower <a href="../g/nigroesbeck3370.html">Nicholas Groesbeck</a> then of New Brunswick, New Jersey. Perhaps they were the couple who married at the Albany church in 1729. He is said to have died in New Jersey in 1754.

<p>Johanna Van Corlear Rumney probably died sometime thereafter. We seek defining information on her later life and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.</p>
