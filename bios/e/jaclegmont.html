<P>Referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Jacob Claese</strong></a> lived in Albany County during the last half of the seventeenth century. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jNcUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=%22jacob+claese%22&source=bl&ots=4GtD-GJlvt&sig=k2lqzQMJAtIZnocl8vOPFK5pp5c&hl=en&ei=sKPOTYyzD8LcgQfdrPnHDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22jacob%20claese%22&f=false">said</a> to have been born in 1653 and to have been the son of Claes Cornelise and Breghie [Egmont]. Those <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> lived in New Amsterdam and on Staten Island. We seek information on his <a href="../qqqq.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In August <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html">1683</a>, he was among those "living <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">below</a>" when he contributed to the support of a minister at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>Jacob Claese was married to Maria Lucasz (<a href="../../res/guess.html">perhaps</a> Ouderkirk) and was the father of at least two children who were christened in 1684 and '85.

<p>Church records noted that Jacob Claese had died by the time his last child was baptized in December 1685. That <a href="jaegmont7919.html">son</a> grew up and became an Albany resident. His widow <a href="../vv/cotvvechten2449.html">re-married</a> in 1689.</p>
