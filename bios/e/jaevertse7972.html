<P>This <a href="#sources"><strong>Jacob Evertsen</strong></a> was born about 1767. We are uncertain about his parentage but would expect him to have been a member of the Albany-area <a href="everts.html">Evertson family</a>.

<p>His wife was <a href="../s/ansling.html">Hannah Slingerland</a> - although we still <a href="../../inprog.html">search</a> for her connection to the larger Albany family. Between 1789 and 1807, at least five children were christened in Albany churches.

<p>For several decades from the 1790s until his death, he was an Albany mainliner. In 1798, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cordwainer</a>.  He probably lived at 22 <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a> and owned at least three additional lots in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany as well. Beginning in 1800, his third ward household was configured on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">census</a>.

<p>Listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 22 Fox Street from the first edition in 1813, in 1815 and 1816, his name in the directory listing was <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">italicized</a> - identifying him as a "free person of color." However, subsequent listings carried no such distinction.

<p>Jacob Evertsen died in July 1829 at the age of sixty-two. He was <a href="../../drc.html#sources">buried</a> from the Dutch church and his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA147&lpg=PA147&dq=%22jacob+evertsen%22+albany&source=web&ots=SoevXJrhCi&sig=dO5deQud78xyfGPZu2HF50J80To#PPA147,M1">stone</a> resides in the church plot. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in September of that year. Letters of administration were issued a month later.</p>
