<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Abraham Ellison</strong></a> probably was born about 1750.

<p>Was he the same Abraham Ellison who <a href="http://www.royalprovincial.com/Military/Musters/loyamassoc/laasecondco.htm">belonged</a> to the Boston-based "Loyal American Association" in July 1775? Afterwards, that individual was a refugee to New Brunswick, Nova Scotia -  at least for a time. 

<p>At one time, an Abraham Ellison ran a <a href="http://www.bookbindersmuseum.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=449&Itemid=52">bookstore in Boston</a> on "Head of Bull's Wharf" on Sevenstar Lane.

<p>In May 1780, a New York <a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">marriage</a> license was issued for Abraham Ellison and <a href="../m/elmumford.html">Elizabeth Mumford</a>, a spinster. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cz8OAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA13-PA1743&dq">Perhaps</a>, it was his second marriage.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#7943">1790</a>, the Albany census counted him as the head of a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household that included himself and four females. Within a few years, he had relocated to a <a href"../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">modest home</a> in the first ward where his family consisted of a boy, three girls, himself,  and two older women as listed on the census of  <a href="../../census1800.html#7943">1800</a>.

<p>In 1792, he was identified as one of the trustees of the Albany Methodist Church.

<p>In 1800 and 1801 he <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">paid</a> the Albany government twelve dollars to be licensed as a tavern owner.

<p>Abraham Ellison was dead by 1810 when his widow was listed as the head of their household on the Albany census. She lived on at 34 Montgomery Street for many years and died in 1831.
