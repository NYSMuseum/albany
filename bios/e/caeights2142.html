<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Catherine Eights Van Woert</strong></a> was born about 1750. She was the sister of newcomer sailmaker <a href="abeights7800.html">Abraham Eights</a>. By the late 1760s, she probably had taken up residence in her brother's waterfront home.

<p>In 1773, she became the wife of Albany businessman <a href="../vw/hevwoert2585.html">Hendrick Van Woert</a>. By 1791, their eight children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a pewholder.

<p>These Van Woerts were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#2585">mainstays</a> who lived in a modest house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In 1798, Catherine was named in the will filed by her husband. Hendrick Van Woert died in 1813. 
 
<p>Catherine Eights Van Woert lived on in their home at 64 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson</a> Street. She died in October 1825 and was buried from her church. She had lived seventy-four years.
