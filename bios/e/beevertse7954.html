<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Bernardus Evertsen</strong></a> was baptized 
        on November 1, 1747. He was the son of <a href="joevertse7975.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../l/sulagrange7974.html">Susanna La Grange</a> Evertson. 
        He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</A> home of an Albany cooper. 
      <p>As early as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his third 
        ward property was accorded a modest <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7954">assessment</a>. 
        In May <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#7954">1767</a>, his name 
        appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. 
      <p>In July 1771, he married blacksmith's daughter <a href="../h/mahogan4381.html">Martina 
        Hogan</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1789, six children had been christened in the church where he was a member 
        and supporter. 
      <p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1771">1771</a>, he was appointed 
        constable for the first ward but did not serve and was replaced. In his 
        prime during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war years</a>, we have 
        not found much record of his service. However, afterwards, he was accorded 
        a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7954">land bounty right</a> in 
        conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. In 1779, he joined in a 
        community-based petition on behalf of fellow cordwainer <a href="../t/jotillman.html">John 
        Tillman</a>. 
      <p>Bernardus Evertsen was involved in the <a href="../../trades/leather.html">leather 
        trade</a>. He was known as a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanner</a> 
        and also as a cordwainer. As time passed, he held tan pits and also owned 
        a tannery on <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a>. In 1793, 
        he was a founding vice-president of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany 
        Mechanics Society</a>. 
      <p>In 1788 and 1791, he served in Albany fire companies. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7954">1790</a>, 
        his third ward home was configured on the city census. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7954">1800</a>, 
        his second ward home included nine family members. 
      <p>In 1791, he was among the six children named as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willjoeverts7975.html">will</a> 
        of their father. 
      <p>Bernardus Evertsen died in January 1802 and was buried in the church. 
        His widow passed five years later. </p>
