<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Evertse</strong></a> is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in 1671. He would have been the son of <a href="eveverts.html">Evert</a> and Maria Evertse. He grew up in the Albany home of a cooper who also may have lived in New York.

<p>In November 1697, he married "Martine Simonz" (Veeder) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced at least four children. However, he was a prominent <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> deacon and trustee.

<p>These Evertsens made their <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7967">home</a> on what became the eastern corner of Broadway and Maiden Lane in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He seems to have lived in close proximity to his father and brother <a href="jaevertse7966.html">Jacob</a>. Jan also was known as a cooper.

<p>This Jan Evertse served on juries and as assessor, constable, and firemaster in the third ward beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1706">1706</a>. He also was identified as a <a href="../../trades/sur.html">surveyor</a> in 1708. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#7967">1715</a>, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#7967">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders in the third ward. During the 1720s, his house was an Albany landmark.
 
<p>In August 1725, he <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">was</a> named in the will filed by his father. Jan Evertse was buried in the Lutheran churchyard in August 1726. His widow survived until 1728.</p>
