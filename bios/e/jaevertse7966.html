<strong>Jacob Evertsen</strong></a> was born about 1671. He was the son of Evert Janse and Maria Everts. Later, he was called a native of Albany.</p>

<p>He married <a href="../h/elhallenbeck5263.html">Elizabeth Jans Hallenbeck</a> at the Loonenburg <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> in June 1705. At that time, he was called a "bachelor" - alluding to the fact that he was more than a decade past the average <a href="../../marriages.html">marriage age</a>. Over the next two decades, several children were christened in the Lutheran church at Albany.

<p>These Evertsens lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Jacob served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in 1712 and was elected assistant <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> that same October. His modest holdings were assessed on the city tax list in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#7966">1709</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#7966">1720</a> and two decades later, in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3">1742</a>, he was counted among the freeholders of the third ward. He also served on juries and as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html"> militia</a> company.

<p>Jacob Evertsen died in 1755 and was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on January 11.</p>
