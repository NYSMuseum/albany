<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Egberts</b></a> was born about 1664. She was the daughter of <a href="tetegb4498.html">Teunis T.</a> and Egbertie Egbertse. She was identified and provided for in their <a href="../../wills/willttegberts4498.html">joint will</a> filed in August 1685.</p>


<p>In September 1686, she married <a href="../b/dibradt4344.html">Dirck Barentse Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1701, four of their children had been baptized there. The marriage produced at least two others not in the Albany church records. Over the next three decades, both parents were frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Bradts were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#163">mainstays</a> who lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> - probably in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of the city.</p> 


<p>Anna Egberts Bradt died in December 1729 and was buried in the church. Her husband lived until 1735.</p>
