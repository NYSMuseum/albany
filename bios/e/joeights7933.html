            <P><A href="#biography"><B>Jonathan Eights</B></A> was born in January 
              1773. He would be the only surviving son of the eleven children 
              born to the marriage of Albany sailmaker <a href="abeights7800.html">Abraham 
              Eights</a> and <a href="../b/cabrooks342.html">Catherine Brooks</a>.</P>
            <P>Although raised along the Albany waterfront, Jonathan instead became 
              a <a href="../../trades/medical.html">physician</a>. He first received 
              a classical education in the school of <a href="../m/geomerchant.html">George 
              Merchant</a>. Then, he was trained in the medical offices of Albany 
              doctors <a href="../m/wilman.html">Wilhelmus Mancius</a> and <a href="../w/hunwood.html">Hunlock 
              Woodruff</a>. In 1795, he was examined and then licensed to practice 
              medicine. His first few years were devoted to practice in the areas 
              around Albany and then in Canajoharie. In 1797, he went to Philadelphia 
              for a year of advanced surgical training. Returning to Montgomery 
              County, he built a substantial medical practice there.</p>
            <p>In May 1810, he returned to Albany and established a home and office 
              at <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">92 North Pearl Street</a> 
              that became an Albany landmark for half a century.</p>
            <p>Dr. Eights had a private practice but was best known as the Alms 
              House physician. He reputedly taught a number of medical men, was 
              a director and trustee of several benevolent organizations, and 
              an active Masonic member as well.</p>
            <p>By the mid-1790s, he had married Manhatttan-born <a href="../w/alwynkoop6951.html">Alida 
              Wynkoop</a>, a long-time acquaintance who came to Albany with her 
              family as a girl. Their marriage produced a small family of a <a href="jaeights2036.html">son</a> 
              and two daughters.</p>
            <p>Jonathan Eights died in 1848 at age seventy-five.</p>
