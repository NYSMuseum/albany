<strong>Martin Everts</strong></a> was listed on the <a href="../../census1756.html#47">census</a> of Albany householders taken by the British army in June 1756. At that time, he was identified as a laborer. His modest home was judged able to accommodate only two soldiers "in a pinch," that it had only one fireplace, one room with "fire," and that the family occupied one room. 

<p><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, Martin "Evers"  probably was born during the 1720s or 1730s. At this point, we have not been able to connect him with the branches of the Albany <a href="everts.html">Everts</a> family - although he may have been the son of <a href="joevertse7975.html">Johannes Evertse</a>. Incomplete <a href="../../stpeters.html">Anglican</a> and <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> baptism records have impaired our determination of his origins.

<p>A son named "Johannes" was born to Marten Evert and Catarina Steur and christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in August 1753. Their daughter, Margarita, was baptized by Reverend <a href="../o/jogilvie.html">Oglivie</a> in December 1755.  Almost a decade later, on June 10, 1764, the marriage of "Marten Everts" (Crannel:) and Cathar. Chester, "both of this City," was certified by "banns" in the Albany Dutch church records.  His name is otherwise absent from existing Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church</a> records.

<p>This individual was an Albany resident during the 1750s. His name has not been found in the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">body of records</a> for greater Albany County for the 1760s. We seek information on his origins and later life.
