<strong>Benjamin Egbertse</strong></a> was born in March 1686. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="egteunise4500.html">Egbert Teunise</a> and <a href="../b/mabradt4270.html">Maria Bradt</a>  Egbertse. He grew up in a businessman's <a href="../../census1697.html#046">home</a> in Albany's third ward. However, he was not named in the <a href="../../wills/willegteunise4500.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1704.


<p>About 1710, he married <a href="../v/anvisscher4092.html">Anna Visscher</a>. By 1720, the marriage had produced four children who were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, pewholder, and baptism sponsor.

<p>These Egbertses settled on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Benjamin was a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">businessman</a> and active in civic affairs. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4508">1720</a> and again in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4508">1742</a>, he was identified as a freeholder living in the second ward. A <a  href="../../census1756.html#126">census of households</a> taken by the British army in 1756 called him "Mr. Benj. Egbers" and identified him as a merchant. In 1764, his name may have been included on a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4508">petition</a> signed by  Albany merchants.

<p>He held a number of local positions. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1708">1708</a>, he was appointed constable for the third ward while still living in his father's house. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1714">1714</a>, he was chosen to be a firemaster for the first ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1725">1725</a>, he was selected to serve as firemaster in the second ward. He also served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and as juror and contractor of the city. 

<p>In November 1737, he was among those who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor.

<p>In January 1774, a <a href="../../sources.html#jp">letter</a> referring to his accounts stated that Benjamin Egbertse was deceased.</p>
