<strong>Egbert Egberts</strong></a> was born in March 1711. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="beegberts4508.html">Benjamin</a> and <a href="../v/anvisscher4092.html">Anna Visscher</a> Egberts. He grew up in a businessman's home located in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.


<p>Egbert Egberts married twice. He wed Rachel [ __ ] in September 1727. After having six children christened (between 1728 and 1739) at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch</a> and <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> churches, Rachel died and he married <a href="../l/malent.html">Maria Lents</a>. That union produced at least four children between 1743 and 1756.</p>

<p>This Egberts family lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. "Capt. Egbers" skippered a sloop and also was known as a <a href="../../census1756.html#121">"schiper"</a> and mariner. He served the community as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> three times from <a href="../../org/cc.html#1731">1731</a> to 1749. He was a <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4515">freeholder</a> and contractor of the city. He also owned <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> in New York City that had been <a href="../../wills/willmalent.html">acquired</a> by the couple in 1740.

<p>He filed a <a href="../../wills/willegegberts4515.html">will</a> in 1760. It named his wife Maria and five living children as his heirs. Egbert (Teunisse) Egberts was buried from his church in August 1760. He had lived fifty-nine years.
