      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Daniel Ertzberger</b></a> may have been or was 
        descended from the Daniel Ertzberger born in Berks County, Pennsylvania 
        in 1720. That person was the son of John Jacob and Dorothea Schaeffer 
        Ertzberger.</p>
      <p>In June 1743, Daniel Ertzberger married Regina Catherine Leonard. By 
        1765, they were in Albany where their children were baptized at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1765 and 1771. In 1779 
        and 1781, other children were baptized by the parents in the <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/gilead03.htm">Gilead 
        Lutheran church</a> in across the Hudson River in Brunswick.</p>
      <p>In 1767, he was identified as an enlisted man in John Winne's <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company.</p>
      <p>After the War for Independence, he received a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land 
        bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the first regiment of 
        the Albany County militia.</p>
      <p>In 1790, a Daniel Ertzberger was listed on the census for the town of 
        Livingston in Columbia County. In 1800, his family was configured on the 
        <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census with a man and 
        woman each over forty-six years old.</p>
      <p>In 1785, he purchased a lot east of the road leading from Albany to Watervliet 
        from John P. Fonda. In May 1815, his widow, Regina, released her claim 
        to that lot!</p>

        <a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Daniel Ertzberger/Hartzberger 
        has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
        This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. At this point, 
        we have uncovered no information placing the eighteenth century Daniel 
        Ertzberger in the city of Albany! Why then, did his name appear on the 
        city regiment <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#e">bounty list</a>?</font></p>
