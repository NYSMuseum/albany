<strong>Benjamin Egberts</strong></a> was born between 1739 and 1743. He was the first of five children born to <a href="egegberts4515.html">Egbert Egberts</a> and his second wife, <a href="../l/malent.html">Maria Lent</a> Egberts. His father was a skipper who raised a large, combined family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Benjamin was named in the <a href="../../wills/willegegberts4515.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1760.

<p>In 1763, he was <a href="../../wills/willmalent.html">identified</a> as the eldest son of Maria Lent and named to share in her estate which included <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> in New York City.

<p>At this point, we have not encountered marriage, family, or church information about him.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#sources">1764</a>, he may have been the "Benjamin Egbertse" whose name was on a list of Albany merchants petitioning the royal governor. Two years later, his name first appreared on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> with modest property in the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a>, he was appointed firemaster.

<p>Beginning in 1763, he was identifed as a lieutenant in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. By 1776, he had become a captain. In 1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#4510">exempted</a> from militia duty because he was a clerk at the <a href="../../loc/hospital.html">hospital</a>. An affidavit attested that Egberts had served for more than two years.

<p>He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>.

<p>In 1784, he was named co-executor and beneficiary of the estate of his brother, Jacob Visscher Egberts.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, a Benjamin Egberts was listed as the head of a household in the Montgomery Ward of New York City. Perhaps, that Albany Benjamin Egberts had moved to his mother's property as his name dropped from Albany rolls after 1784. </p>
