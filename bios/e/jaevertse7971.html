<strong>Jacob Evertson, Jr.</strong></a> was born in September 1724. He was the youngest child of <a href="jaevertse7966.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../h/elhallenbeck5263.html">Elizabeth Hallenbeck</a> Evertson. He grew up in a middling family home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. His father died early in 1755 and his mother may have taken charge of their Albany home.  He was known as "Jacob Evertson, Jr." - particularly prior to the death of his father.

<p>He may not have married but occasionally witnessed a baptism at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1746">1746</a>, he was chosen constable for the third ward. Although he probably was living in Albany, at this point we cannot place him on the <a href="../../census1756.html">census</a> of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html#272">1756</a> unless he was living with his widowed mother. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#7971">1763</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#7971">1766</a>, he joined his neighbors in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. About that time, his third ward house and lot were valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> rolls.

<p>After the 1760s, the course of his life is a mystery. Ample <a href="../../cbr.html">co</a>mmunity-based information exists for extending the <a href="../bioindex.html#ev">lives</a> of a number of Jacob Evertsons.</p>
