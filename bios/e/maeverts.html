<strong>Maria Everts</strong></a> probably was born about 1710. She would have been a member of the Albany <a href="everts.html">Everts</a> family. However, incomplete <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lu</a>theran church records may have deprived us of defining baptismal information.

<p>In November 1734, "Maria Evertson" married twenty-three-year-old <a href="../l/gejalansing3705.html">Gerrit Ja. Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1738, three children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Lansings made their home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street<a/> where Gerrit was known as a gunsmith, merchant, and Albany official. Her <a href="../l/jalansing3726.html">son</a> followed his father in the gunsmith's trade. The <a href="../l/gejalansing3705.html#sons">ch</a>ildren of Gerrit Jacobse's second marriage would be far more prominent.

<p>However, their marriage would last for less than a decade as Maria Everts Lansing died early in 1741 and was buried from the church. By 1748, her husband had re-married and continued to raise a large combined family in their Albany home.</p>
