<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, one-time Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Elliot</strong></a> was born prior to 1755. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=goRAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22elliott%22&source=bl&ots=Wm3aT1Q5vh&sig=blRDLLlJsIxF_79Cpm-gCziIhjw&hl=en&ei=mBfcTO_XOoW8lQeuiMyuCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22elliott%22&f=false">said</a> to have migrated from <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a>. However, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. A number of same-named contemporaries <a href="../../res/guess.html">are</a> at risk. 

<p>His wife was Albany native <a href="../k/rekid.html">Rebecca Kidney</a> (b. 1723). It appears that their marriage produced <a href="../../children.html">children</a>. However, we have not documented christenings in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. On the other hand, some baptism <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jankidney/93.html">information</a> has been found in church records from Dutchess County during the 1750s. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> church affiliation information. In May <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/aluth002.htm">1786</a>, James and Rebecca witnessed a baptism at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church.

<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime activities</a>. His name has not been found in the record of Albany's <a href="../../guide/histres.html#arrec">wartime</a> agencies. However, afterwards, he received a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7941">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1784">1784</a>, he was chosen city <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">marshall</a>. He still held the office in 1792.

<p>On September <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false">10</a>, 1785, he was among those who "purchased" a lot where the "old store" stood from the city <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>.

<p>These Elliots made their home near those of Rebecca's  <a href="../k/kidney.html">kin</a> on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7941">1788</a>, his house and property were valued on the city assessment roll. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">later</a>, only his personal property was valued at $25 - perhaps under the property of the Court Street <a href="../b/bogert.html">Bogerts</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7941">1790</a>, his first ward household consisted of a man and two females. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#7941">later</a>, an aging couple and a young boy lived in his household. At that time, another same-named but younger couple <a href="../../census1800.html#jael">lived</a> on the north side of the city. Also, "<a href="../../census1800.html#janeel">Jane Elliott</a>" and another similarly aged female shared a third ward home. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, this individual's household was configured on the city census for the final time.

<p> Rebecca Kidney Elliot died in February 1809 and was buried in the Dutch church plot.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=%22elliot+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22elliot%20james%22&f=false">1813</a> and thru the 1815 edition, he was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> at 25, 27, and 29 Washington<a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">/</a>South Pearl Street. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c7IwAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22james+elliot%22+albany&source=bl&ots=zBWNuR83AR&sig=x2AN3dReAdgrQ-UjjpAdR96K4cs&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22james%20elliot%22%20albany&f=false">1814</a>, he was listed as "serjeant" on a roster entitled "Officers in Chancery."

<p>James Elliot was dead by November 1816 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on his estate.</p>
