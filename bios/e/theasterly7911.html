<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Easterly</strong></a> was born prior to 1756. We seek <a href="../../res/origins.html">information</a> on his background and on his arrival in Albany.

<p>Because his name has not been found in the pre-<a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> city records nor in those of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a>, perhaps he did not arrive in Albany until after the campaign of 1777.

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities, he enlisted in supported the American cause and was drafted out of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> to serve as a soldier in the First and Second regiments of the New York <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">Line</a>. A same-named individual also was identified as a lieutenant assigned to a vessel on Lake George in 1777. In June <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=vdoTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA884&lpg=PA884&dq=%22thos+easterly%22+albany&source=bl&ots=Vyy4Yryr2s&sig=NCOJglgHISwzDWegBolYkY-bqk8&hl=en&ei=nvPKTM6eEYL98AahoJmcDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22thos%20easterly%22%20albany&f=false">1780</a>, his name was among the carpenters exempted from militia duty by <a href="../l/morlewis.html">Morgan Lewis</a> to work on his Albany house. Afterwards, he was granted a 
<a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7911">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In December 1779, he married <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet native <a href="../vw/bavwoert2412.html">Bata Van Woert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1792, the marriage had produced at least seven children. He contributed to the church and was an occasional baptism sponsor. However, he does not seem to have been a church pewholder. Subsequent Albany Easterlys were <a href="../../presbyterian.html">P</a>resbyterians.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October 1779</a>, his Albany property was accorded a moderate assessment. A decade later, his house and property in the second ward were <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7911">valued</a> modestly.

<p>In 1788 and again in 1791, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a> identified him as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fireman</a> in the first ward.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7911">1790</a>, the census counted nine family members. A decade later, his household was <a href="../../census1800.html#7911">enumerated</a> under the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> and described eight people. 

<p>In January 1799, he and his wife sold a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lot</a> located on <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">M</a>aiden Lane. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a>, he was identified as a freeholder and a merchant. Thomas Easterly <a href="../qqqq.html">died</a> sometime thereafter.</p>
