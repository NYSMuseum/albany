<P>Subsequent sources tell us that Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Easton</strong></a> born about 1764. We seek definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, he most likely was the son of <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> cordwainer <a href="joeaston7912.html">John Easton</a> and his wife, <a href="../r/jarutherford.html">Janet Rutherford</a> Easton. 

      <p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7914">1800</a>, his first ward household 
        was configured on the Albany census in the same <a href="../../census1790.html#7912">place</a> as that of the recently deceased John Easton. 
        William's household also included a woman born before 1756 (probably his 
        mother). Subsequent censuses would chart the growth of his family. 
      <p>June 1802, William Easton of the city of Albany married <a href="../p/abplatt.html">[Abigail] Platt</a> (also of Albany) at the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. 

<p>Like John Easton, William was a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> and a member of the <a href="../../ams.html#members">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>However, by <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=%22easton%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=easton&f=false">1813</a>, he had moved as first city directory in 1813, listed him a resident of 68 <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> while widow Jannet Easton remained in the                                                                                                                                                                                  house on Beaver Street. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1813ad">directories</a> would fix his residence at 195 Market Street - a location <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/49003/FLHG_10000VREastNY-0147/493?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fdb%3dFLHG-10000VREastNY%26gss%3dsfs28_ms_db%26new%3d1%26rank%3d1%26msT%3d1%26gsfn%3dwilliam%26gsfn_x%3dNN%26gsln%3deaston%26gsln_x%3d0%26msydy%3d1830%26MSAV%3d1%26uidh%3d9w2&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnSearchResults&rc=808,517,949,545;969,519,1087,545;1562,2610,1701,2637">later described</a> as the corner of Columbia and North Pearl Streets where his son-in-laws funeral was held in January 1830.  

<p>On April 5, 1841, an Albany <a href="https://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany10munsuoft/annalsofalbany10munsuoft_djvu.txt">newspaper</a> reported the death of William Easton at age seventy-seven. His widow, <a href="../p/abplatt.html">Abigail Platt Easton</a>, may have lived somewhat longer at her/their home at 55 Maiden Lane.</p>
