<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, Albany resident <a href="#sources">
<strong>Godfrey Enax</strong></a> was born in Europe - probably before 1750. 

<p>In July 1771, was in Albany when he married Margaret Shurger at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. We seek evidence of any children.

<p>In October 1773, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA254&lpg=PA254*&dq=enox+albany&source=bl&ots=wwhJ8VAber&sig=MdL9toBFfA875sGzif4XhvocvYI&hl=en&ei=RiBWSoOVKNPDtwf-k-nJAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10">questioned</a> during a disputed election for the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">Common Council</a>. It appeared that he had been born in Holland and he had not been <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a>. Thus, his vote was disallowed.

<p>In 1775, the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> paid him three shillings for "three earthen dishes." Although we have yet to connect him with specific <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities, afterwards he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7951">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In Spetember 1777, "George Enax" witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willnibrouwer.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor. 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7951">1779</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> property was valued on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">both</a> city assessment rolls.

<p>In June 1786, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA162&lpg=PA162&dq=enax&source=bl&ots=krwfaK-HwO&sig=FGE9xxc7Eptxpnyzvr1cNUptv0A&hl=en&ei=RgVWSoizIJaJtgfego3lAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9">listed</a> as one of two "church counsels" for the Evangelical <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church in Albany. At that time, he was identified as "Gottfried Enax, Doctor Medic."
<p>In August 1786, "Dr. Eenacc" was buried from the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he had witnessed a baptism in 1772. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7951">1788</a>, the third ward house and lot of "Widow Enox" was listed on the assessment roll. She was buried from the church in November 1792.</p>
