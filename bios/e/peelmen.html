<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter Edmund Elmendorf</strong></a> was born in September 1764. He was last child <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/peter-edmund-elmendorf_18213094">born</a> to the marriage of Peter Edmund Elmendorph and Mary Crooks Elmendorf of Kingston. <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers, the <a href="http://theelmendorffamily.org/getperson.php?personID=P2743&tree=tree1">Elmendorf family</a> had been living in Kingston since its earliest days. His same-named father, a prominent businessman, died less than a year after Peter's birth and he would be raised by his widowed mother and older siblings.

<p>In 1768, his <a href="caelmendorf.html">sister</a> relocated to Albany following her marriage to prominent businessman <a href="../b/rubleecker228.html">Rutger Bleecker</a>. Catherine's  youngest brother seems have joined her for, in September 1787, Peter Elmendorf was identified as the co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willrubleecker228.html">estate</a> of his brother-in-law. Bleecker's early death brought Peter even closer to his widowed sister.

<p>Prior to coming to Albany, he was sent to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=P9j_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA361&lpg=PA361&dq=elmendorf+princeton&source=bl&ots=FQE4GVi7Oe&sig=dvGxaOlgUc96PbcizprVIJeEKSI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwijgv_7oNvSAhXli1QKHV3LBzk4ChDoAQglMAI#v=onepage&q=elmendorf%20princeton&f=false">Princeton University</a> - perhaps as early as 1780. Peter Elmendorf graduated from Princeton in 1782. During that time, he maintained a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=zwVS5gsJMUcC&pg=PA1915&lpg=PA1915&dq=peter+elmendorf+princeton&source=bl&ots=DixOkXyFVt&sig=GLdICYloZeGqe6UDa4H53Jh3yeE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjx-vz75uLSAhXD6IMKHfDpBHoQ6AEINTAF#v=onepage&q=peter%20elmendorf%20princeton&f=false">telling</a> correspondence (perhaps in addition to his collegiate <a href="http://etcweb1.
princeton.edu/Campus/text_revolution.html (Accessed October 2, 2007.)">diary</a>) on a number of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_3SaaPJEKV4C&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=peter+elmendorf+princeton&source=bl&ots=4tXINd2Ade&sig=3AOs_Sd-tWAJSnC1GQ8Q-bO975M&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjDgs3U6OLSAhUs2IMKHYgVC_g4ChDoAQgZMAA#v=onepage&q=peter%20elmendorf%20princeton&f=false">topics</a> with his mother. 

      <p>This individual is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/peteredmundelmendorfhiswives/">said</a> 
        to have married twice - both times to women named Elizabeth Van Rensselaer 
        who were his Pearl Street neighbors. In March 1793, he married Elisabeth 
        Van Rensselaer <a href="../../res/guess.html">in Albany</a> [no marriage 
        record at the church]. That marriage is said to have produced two daughters 
        who would be christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        in 1793 and 1796. Then, in September 1802, he married [a different] <a href="../vr/elvr5076.html">Elizabeth 
        Van Rensselaer</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        where their <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/peter-edmund-elmendorf_18213094">children</a> 
        would be baptized. In 1805, he was identified as a member of the church 
        Consistory. In 1815, Peter and Elizabeth joined the Second Dutch church. 
		
<p>Although admitted to practice <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>, except for being identified as a Surrogate in 1807, he does not seem to have held official positions in the Albany city government. At that time, he was <a href="../../wills/willjevr5085.html">named</a> as co-executor of the estate of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer. However, he was involved in a number of progressive initiatives. In <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#7945">1794</a>, 
        he pledged £40 toward the establishment of Union College. In 1797, he 
        would be counted among the advocates for the chartering of a library in Albany.
		
<p>These Elmendorfs raised their family at what would be known as <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=%22elmendorf+peter%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=elmendorf&f=false">66 
        North Pearl Street</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7945">1800</a>, 
        the second ward census began to document his growing household that included 
        three slaves. A year earlier, his house, lot, and personal property on 
        along the west side of Pearl Street were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessed</a> 
        moderately. A later chronicler <a href="#50">recalled</a> his property at that location. 
		
<p>In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#7945">1808</a>, he was among those worthies invited to the funeral of Henry J. Bleecker.


<p>Peter Edmund Elmendorf died in May 1835. He had lived seventy years. Later that month, <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/8800/005114127_00241?pid=2003426&backurl=http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv%3D1%26db%3DUSProbateNY%26h%3D2003426%26new%3D1&treeid=&personid=&hintid=&usePUB=true&usePUBJs=true">letters of administration</a> were granted on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a>. His <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=102214346">remains</a> found their way to <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.

        <p><b>Albany Fifty years ago</b>: Peter E. Elmendorf lived in the house 
          No. 12, attributed to Nicholas Bleecker, and in the next house resided 
          Gerardus Lansing, brother-in-law of Gen. Ten Broeck, and formerly an 
          Indian interpreter. A house has been omitted which stood next to No. 
          13, built and occupied by John Rutger Bleecker, a surveyor. These discrepancies 
          are not much to be wondered at, when we consider what disputes sometimes 
          arise where property is accurately described. No. 12 was the last of 
          the old houses in that row, and was taken down but a few years ago. 
          The site is now occupied by the free stone front dwelling of William 
          S. Learned, Esq. This lot is said to have belonged originally to Maria 
          Sanders, daughter of Robert Sanders and wife of Philip Van Rensselaer. 
          It descended to her daughter Betsey, the first wife of Peter E. Elmendorf. 
          From Mrs. Elmendorf it descended to her daughter Maria, wife of Peter 
          Sanders, still living; and was conveyed by her to William White, and 
          by him to the present owner. In this house Burgoyne was entertained 
          at a large dinner party while he was in Albany, by Mr. Philip Van Rensselaer. 
          Peter E. Elmendorf afterwards lived in a house nearly opposite to this 
          lot, where stands the house built by Mr. Thomas W. Olcott, at present 
          owned by Azariah E. Stimson.
