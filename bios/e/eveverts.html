<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Evert Everts</strong></a> is said to have been born just before 1650. This individual mostly was known as "Evert Janse" but also as "Evert Janse [de] Cuyper." He was the patriarch of the Albany Evert<a href="../../res/sp.html">se</a> family. He is sometimes <a href="http://minerdescent.com/2010/08/11/evert-pels/">confused</a> with <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer Evert Evertse <a href="http://www.boydhouse.com/michelle/roosa/evertpels.html">Pels</a> (1624-86), who appears to have been more closely associated with New Amsterdam, Esopus, and Rensselaerswyck. We cannot say that the subject of this sketch was his son.

<p>This presentation organizes information relating to the life of the Albany resident of uncertain <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> who was active during the last quarter of the seventeenth century known as "Evert Janse Cuyper." 

<p>His wife was Maria who died in 1720. Three sons were living in 1725. They adopted the surname "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Evertsen</a>."

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#evev">1674</a>, Evert Jansen Cuyper was among those invited to a Van Rensselaer funeral. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#evev">1679</a>, Evert Janse "Cuyper" was identified as an Albany householder.

<p>His household was not included on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>. Perhaps, he was living in New York at that time.

<p>However, in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#evev">1709</a>, his third ward property near that of his sons in Albany was valued substantially. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#evev">1720</a>, he was listed along with his sons on the list of <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> freeholders.
 
<p>Evert Janse Evertse is <a href="#will">said</a> to have filed a will in May 1725. It named his three sons. His will passed probate in 1733.  </p>
