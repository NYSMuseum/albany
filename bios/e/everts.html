<P>The patronymic "<a href="#sources">Everts</a>" evolved into Evertse and then to Evertsen in eighteenth century <a href="../../criteria.html">Albany</a>. The family <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/17th/dny_15.shtml">lived</a> first in New Amsterdam/New York. A number of "Evertse" lines without a clear, single common ancestor  restrain us from <a href="../../res/guess.html">making</a> potentially pre-mature connections.
		 
<p>The precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> of the Albany Evertsens are unclear but the earliest common ancestors <a href="../../res/ts.html">appear</a> to be "<a href="eveverts.html">Evert Janse</a> "de cuyper" and his wife "Maria." Perhaps Evert was alive in 1725 when he is <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">said</a> to have filed a will.
 
<p>Their sons <a href="jaevertse7966.html">Jacob Evertse</a> (1671-1755) and <a href="joeverts7967.html">Jan</a> Evertse (<a href="../../res/ts.html">al</a>so 1671-1726) raised families in Albany and were connected with the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> in Albany and down the river.

<p>After the home of "<a href="../../census1756.html#192">cryer</a>" "Hans Egar," two <a href="../../census1756.html#272">po</a>ssible Everts-named <a href="../../census1756.html#47">ho</a>useholds were listed on the census of city buildings in <a href="../../census1756.html#47">1756</a>.

<p>Two Evertsens received <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7954">land bounty rights</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment following the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> and in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, three Everts-named households appeared on the city census.

<p>The first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=%22evertsen%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22evertsen%22&f=false">1813</a> included four Everts-named households. Two years later, six Everts addresses were listed including that of cordwainer <a href="jaevertse7972.html">Jacob Evertsen</a>, whose name was <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">italicized</a> in the  listing thus <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">identifying</a> him as a "free person of color."</p>
