<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Evertsen</b></a> was born in March 1716 and christened in the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>. He was the son of Albany residents Jacob and Elizabeth Hallenbeck Evertsen. </p>


<p>At age twenty-four, he married seventeen-year-old <a href="../l/sulagrange7974.html">Susanna La Grange</a> in the Lutheran church. By 1767, the marriage had produced at least ten children who were baptized in several Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. He probably belonged to the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - where most of his offspring were buried. At any given time, his household was large and included slaves.</p>

<p>Evertsen settled his family in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany where he plied the cooper's trade while serving as the town <a href="../../census1756.html#192">cryer</a>. He also payed taxes on another lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He sometimes was known as "Hans Egar."  In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#7975">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his name had dropped from the census of Albany and Watervliet. Perhaps, he had moved in with one of his three sons who were Albany householders.</p>

<p>Johannes Evertsen filed a <a href="../../wills/willjoeverts7975.html">will</a> that passed probate on March 29, 1791. His wife was dead but six surviving children shared his middling estate.</p>
