<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Egberts</b></a> was born about 1655. She was the daughter of Teunis Teunise and Egbertie Egberts of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and Albany. She was identified and provided for in their <a href="../../wills/willttegberts4498.html">joint will</a> dated August 1685.</p>


<p>By 1676, she had married Harmen Janse Lieverse (Leverse). The marriage produced at least six children before the mid-1690s when Harmen Janse probably died. She was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>She was a widow with children in 1697, when her house was configured on the <a href="../../census1697.html#007">city census</a>. In 1709, three parcels of real estate (in three different <a href="../../wards.html">wards</a>) were listed under her name on the Albany assessment roll. </p>

<p>In 1700, she was paid by the church for "nursing the dead." In 1713, the Albany government ordered her to clear her celler gutters. She was called "Maritje Egbertse."

<p>Her date of death has not been established!</p>
