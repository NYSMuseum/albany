<P><a href="#sources"><b>Susanna Egberts</b></a> was born in January 1689. She was the daughter of merchant <a href="egteunise4500.html">Egbert Teunise</a> and his wife, <a href="../b/mabradt4270.html">Maria Bradt</a> Egberts. She grew up in a large family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1704, she was identified in the <a href="../../wills/willegteunise4500.html">will</a> of her father.</p>


<p>In June 1709, she married <a href="../v/javisscher4138.html">Jacob Dirckse Visscher</a> at the Albany Dutch church. The marriage lasted more than fifty years. But unlike most early Albany <a href="../../marriages.html">unions</a>, the marriage does not seem to have produced any children.</p>

<p>These Visschers also lived in the third ward in a house on the Northern corner of Steuben and Market Streets. Her husband was a merchant and alderman and their home was attended by servants.</p>

<p>Susanna Egberts Visscher died in August 1761 and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> from the Albany church. Her husband lived for another two years.</p>
