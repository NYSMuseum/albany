<P>By 1779, <a href="#sources"><b>John Easton</b></a> had settled in Albany. In that year, he was listed on the assessment roll as a homeowner in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Two years later, he purchased "<a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7912">freedom of the city</a>" - the right to conduct business in Albany. At that time, he was identified as 
        a <a href="../../makers.html#leather">cordwainer</a>.</p>


<p>He was married to <a href="../r/jarutherford.html">Janet Rutherford</a>. In 1779, their son was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Other births followed. In 1788, another son was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. Future Albany householder <a href="wmeaston.html">William Easton</a> probably was their older son.</p>

      <p>During the 1780s and 90s, this shoemaker was an <a href="../../census1790.html#7912">Albany 
        mainstay</a>. His middling <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7912">home</a> on <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">upper 
        State Street</a> housed a growing family. In 1797, he was listed as a 
        trustee of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.</p>

<p>John Easton died in August 1799 and was buried from the First Presbyterian church. He had lived sixty years. His eldest <a href="wmeaston.html">son</a> was listed on the census of <a href="../../census1800.html#7914">1800</a> in the Easton house!</p>
