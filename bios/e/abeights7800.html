<P><A href="#biography"><B>Abraham Eights</B></A> was born in 1745 or 1746. He came to Albany following the <a href="../../7yw.html">last</a> French and Indian War. By 1766, he had taken up <a href="#residence">residence</a> on the Albany waterfront where he began to earn a living as a sailmaker.

<p>Early in that year, he joined the crusade for American liberties when he signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#7800">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty.
			  
<p>In June 1770, he married <a href="../b/cabrooks342.html">Catherine Brooks</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican 
              Church. At that time, he was a member and supporter of St. Peters. 
              Later, he joined the Presbyterian Church where he was an elder and 
              trustee for the last thirty years of his life. Over the next two 
              decades, their eleven children were baptized in three Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.</p>

<p>By the eve of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>, he was making sails for Albany boats and also selling his wares in New York City. In 1774, he leased a lot adjoining his waterfront property. Gaining stature in his adoped home, in 1775 the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany 
              Committee</a> appointed him a lieutenant in the city militia. Although 
              he soon resigned that commission, he supported the American cause 
              with contributions. After the war, he was granted a land bounty 
              right in connection with the city regiment of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany 
              militia</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7800">1779</a>, his waterside holdings were valued substantially on the spring assessment roll.

<p>Now in middle age, Abraham Eights prospered in post-war Albany. 
              He sold barrels of sugar and other imported items from his waterfront 
              home. He was becoming a riverside <a href="../../census1790.html#7800">mainstay</a> 
              - booming Albany's most visible sailmaker whose work was sought 
              by neighbors and newcomers alike. By 1799, he had taken a lease 
              on a large portion of the new third ward dock. Later, he held the 
              municipal appointment as "Dockmaster." A pillar of the reconstituted 
              Albany Presbyterian church, he also served as a city <a href="../../firemasters.html">fireman</a>.</p>
            <p>Abraham Eights made his will in 1806. At that time, the sixty-year-old 
              said that he was "weak in body" He lived for another fourteen years. 
              He died on January 10, 1820 at age seventy-four. His estate went 
              to his wife and then nine surviving children. His son, <a  href="joeights7933.html">Jonathan</a>, 
              became a prominent physician, His grandson, <a href="jaeights2036.html">James 
              Eights</a>, was one of them most historically interesting characters 
              of nineteenth-century Albany.</p>

              <A name=biography>The life of <B>Abraham Eights</B> is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 7800. This profile is derived 
              chiefly from family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
              resources</a>. Because he ultimately became an officer in the Albany 
              Presbyterian Church and also cannot be connected using family sources, 
              we do not believe that he was related to the Albany <a href="../y/yates.html">Yates 
              family</a> - even though "Abraham" was a popular Yates family name 
              and the name of his first son who died young! Most likely, he was 
              a Scottish immigrant.</p>
            <p><a name=residence></a><b>Residence:</b> That site later was known 
              as 28 <a href="../../streets.html#dock">Dock Street</a>. His house 
              and property were listed on the city assessment roll of 1766.</p>
