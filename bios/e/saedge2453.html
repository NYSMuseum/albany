<P><a href="#sources"><b>Samuel Edge</b></a> was born on the island of <a href="http://www.usvi.net/usvi/stx.html">St. Croix</a> in the West Indies about 1790. By the early 1800s, he was living in Albany and was a part of the Free <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Black</a> community of <a href="../../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor Hill</a>.</p>


<p>The first published <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in 1813 identified him as a sweep in the office at 3 Chapel Street. Perhaps he also lived in the building. By that time, he had married Caty Arnold (Eldrid) at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>. </p>

<p><a href="#stone"><img src="../../images/jpg/graves/saedgestone.jpg" alt="gravestone of Samuel Edge now at Albany Rural Cemetery" align=right vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 width=200></a>Subsequent city directories gave his occupation as "shoemaker" and his address at 3 Chapel, 21 North Pearl, and, in 1830, at 6 Orange Street. Mostly, he was further identified as a "free person of color" in the directories.</p> 

<p>Samuel Edge died in October 1846 and was buried in the African Methodist Episcopal Church plot in the <a href="../../dead.html">municipal cemetery</a>. Later, his stone was relocated to Albany Rural Cemetery. Letters of Administration were issued on his estate on November 30, 1846.</p>

<p>Born in the West Indies, he probably came to the United States as a slave. Samuel Edge lived in the city for almost five decades, was identified with a trade, and was a prominent member of the <a href="../../art/art-jls.html">Afro-Albanian community</a>.</p>
