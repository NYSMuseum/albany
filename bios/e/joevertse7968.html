<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, this <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Evertsen</strong></a> probably was born about 1680. We seek defining information on his origins and life history. Another same-named but older <a href="joeverts7967.html">contemporary</a> (probably his father) living in/or around Albany dictates caution in the assignment of qualitative information. However, this sketch focuses on the younger Johannes Evertsen who appears to have followed his father as a city resident.

<p>In July 1712, this individual married "Barentie Brnyn" (perhaps Bruyn or Pruyn) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1716, the marriage had produced three children - one of whom was christened at the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1714">1714</a>, he was named firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1725">1725</a>, he was chosen firemaster for the third ward. 

<p>In 1715, his name appeared on the roster of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5NwTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA471&lpg=PA471&dq=henry+van+rensselaers22&source=bl&ots=D_XqdMuKFM&sig=7olvag1Soc7vEHPhaJ7hwDryl_8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=As9vUc6RNda04AP3s4CQDg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22cap't%20henry%20van rensselaers%22&f=false">captained</a> by Henry Van Rensselaer.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#7968">1720</a>, he appears to have been noted on a list of freeholders in the third ward. At that time, Jan Evertse and other family members were <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#7967">freeholders</a> in the second ward.

<p>In June 1729, Johannis's property in the second or third ward was <a href="../../doc/cc/0614729.html#4">referenced</a> in the city records.

<p>According to Dutch church burial records, "Hans" Evertsen was buried at the Lutheran church on December 12, 1741.</p>
