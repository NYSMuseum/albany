<P><a href="#sources"><b>Teunis Egbertse</b></a> (Metselaer) may have been born in October of 1680. However, that would have made him almost thirty-six-years-old at the time of his marriage. In 1704, he was mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willegteunise4500.html">will</a> of his father, Albany resident <a href="egteunise4500.html">Egbert Teunise</a>. His mother would have been <a href="../b/mabradt4270.html">Maritje Bradt</a> who grew up in a <a href="../b/dibradt4344.html">home</a> near where he would eventually settle.</p>


<p>In February 1716 Teunis married <a href="../b/enbeekman3909.html">Engeltie Beekman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1736, eleven of their children were christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>During the decades of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> following the end of hostilities in 1713, Teunis Egbertse was a mainline participant in community activities. In 1713, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where he would establish his home. In 1715, he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In 1718, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In 1722, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a> in the third ward and served for a year. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4543">1720</a> and again in 1742, his name appeared on third ward freeholders'lists.</p>

<p>He purchased wheat from and was indebted to the city government. In 1748, his third ward property was noted in the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> of his neighbor, <a href="../t/dtbroeck33.html">Dirck Ten Broeck</a>. After that, his name is absent from Albany rolls.</p>
