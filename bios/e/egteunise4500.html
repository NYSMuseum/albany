<P><a href="#sources"><b>Egbert Teunise</b></a> was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="tetegb4498.html">Teunis Teunise</a> and Egbertje Egberts. He was called "Teunise," "Egbertse," and also sometimes known by the occupational surname of "Metselaer."</p>

<p>By 1680, he had married <a href="../b/mabradt4270.html">Maria Barents Bradt</a>. By 1691, the marriage had produced eight children, most of whom were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, supporter, and a deacon.</p>

<p>He lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1690, he was identified as a merchant who dealt in bark canoes. He served as assessor and juror. In 1689, he was elected assistant alderman. In 1690, <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a> appointed him alderman. Re-elected assistant for the third ward in 1692, he served on the city council for much of the remainder of the century. In <a href="../../census1697.html#046">1697</a>, his household was configured on the Albany census. Two years later, he joined his neighbors in swearing <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4500">allegiance</a> to the king of England.</p>

<p>Active in <a href="../../corporation.html">public business</a>, he often represented Albany into the countryside. In 1707, he purchased land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> on the city's behalf. He may have owned an additional Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">house</a> in the first ward.


<p>Egbert Teunise filed a <a href="../../wills/willegteunise4500.html">will</a> in December 1704. It named his wife and three living children. He was dead by June 26, 1716 when the will passed probate!</p>
