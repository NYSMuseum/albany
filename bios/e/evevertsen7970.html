<strong>Evert Evertsen</strong></a> was born in January 1749. He was the son of <a href="joevertse7975.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../l/sulagrange7974.html">Susanna La Grange</a> Evertsen. He grew up as part of a large family in the modest <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home of an Albany tradesman and placeholder who lived into the1790s.

<p>In February <a href="../../org/cc.html#ee">1775</a>, Evert began to take his place in the community when he was chosen as a replacement constable in the second ward. He seems to have followed his father into the <a href="../../trades/wood.html">cooper</a>'s trade and also continued to <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">live</a> in Johannes Evertsen's third ward house.

<p>His <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities have not been charted comprehensively. In December 1777, he was paid by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> for going to Coxsackie with "sleigh and horses" to "guard and apprehend Tories." He may have been the "Evert" whose name was on the roster of the third and sixth <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiments - although other Everts lived in the southern part of Albany County at that time.

<p>In July 1779, Evert was thirty when he married nineteen-year-old <a href="../g/elgoewy7987.html">Elizabeth Goewy</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1801, the marriage had produced eight or more children.

<p>In March 1791, he was named co-executor of his father's <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> and was slated to receive a quarter share of his real property.

<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7970">1788</a>, Evert had taken over as head of the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> Evertsen homestead . In <a href="../../census1790.html#7970">1790</a>, Evert's home was configured on the third ward census.  A decade later, a flexible city <a href="../../citylimits.html">border</a> probably accounts for the inclusion of Evert's <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census. <a href="../../sources.html#ad">City directories</a>, which began in 1813, fixed his residence at 156 North Market Street and identified him as a cooper.


<p>Evert Evertsen died in July 1823. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in August. His widow lived for many years afterward.
