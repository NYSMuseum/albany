<strong>Maria Egberts</strong></a> was born in February 1714. She was the daughter of <a href="beegberts4508.html">Benjamin</a> and <a href="../v/anvisscher4092.html">Anna Visscher</a> Egberts. She grew up in a merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional <a href="http://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/lansing/jacobjlansing.htm">sources</a> tell us that she was known as "Polly."

<p>In November 1742, she was twenty-eight when she married <a href="../l/jalansing3724.html">Jacob J. Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1759, the marriage had produced nine children - the last born when Maria was forty-five-years old.

<p>These Lansings lived in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> in a landmark house on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> from where Jacob was a well-known silversmith. In 1762, she was left 1/6 of the remaining <a href="../../wills/willjavisscher4138.html">estate</a> of Jacob Visscher - the widower of her childless <a href="suegberts4540.html">aunt</a>.

<p>Maria Egberts Lansing died in March 1771. She had lived for fifty-seven years. She did not live to see the outstanding marriages of her three daughters. Her husband, however, survived until 1791.</p>
