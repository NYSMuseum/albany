<P>Based on subsequent resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hannah Edgar</strong></a> was born in 1762. She was the daughter of newcomer trader <a href="daedgar7917.html">David Edgar</a> and Jane <a href="../g/jagregg7916.html">Gregg</a> Edgar. Her parents were recently arrived <a href="../irish.html">Scots-Irish</a> who settled in Albany. Perhaps Hannah was born in Albany.

<p>These Edgars prospered in Albany until the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775 and then the untimely <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RI1MAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=%22mrs.+edgar+applies%22&source=bl&ots=ME4EMmgZTZ&sig=TmFVyy_ui-30bjIMddg8LxjB4zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiuo9usmZDTAhVjzlQKHZVcC7gQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&q=%22mrs.%20edgar%20applies%22&f=false">death</a> of David Edgar in September 1776. 

      <p>As British subjects, the surviving Edgar family would come under the scrutiny 
        of Albany's new civil authorities. In August 1780, widow Jane Edgar <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RI1MAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=%22mrs.+edgar+applies%22&source=bl&ots=ME4EMmgZTZ&sig=TmFVyy_ui-30bjIMddg8LxjB4zw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiuo9usmZDTAhVjzlQKHZVcC7gQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&q=%22mrs.%20edgar%20applies%22&f=false">applied</a> 
        to Governor Clinton for relief from her dismal economic situation. At 
        that time, she listed her four dependent children including Hannah who 
        was then eighteen. However, her application for a pass to join kin in 
        Canada would be ignored and then denied. 
      <p>Just two months later, in October 1780, Hannah married "Major" <a href="../r/threed.html">Thomas Reed</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. No subsequent family information has been found in our ongoing sweep of community-based resources.

<p>In August 1781, her husband <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GNE4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA770&lpg=PA770&dq=thomas+reed+%22on+account+of+the+illness+of+his+wife%22&source=bl&ots=EJgk3KSrle&sig=VIPAOratAAYqSo2lrGQU6k9eXo8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiMgfuv8qHTAhVJ2mMKHVKcBzwQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&q=thomas%20reed%20%22on%20account%20of%20the%20illness%20of%20his%20wife%22&f=false">was permitted</a> to remain in Albany with his family due to the illness of his wife. 

<p>After that, no further references to her have been encountered. Missing answers to questions regarding her adult life and passing, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Hannah Edgar Reed.</p>
