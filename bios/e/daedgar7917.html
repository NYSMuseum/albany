<P><a href="../../newcomers.html">N</a>ewcomer merchant <a href="#sources"><b>David Edgar</b></a> probably was born in Ireland about 1720. He was of Scottish <a href="../irish.html">ancestry</a>.
		
<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/daedgar.jpg" align=left width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="David Edgar"></a>On January 30, 1753, he was <a href="http://www.geocities.com/edgarexe/">married</a> 
        to <a href="../g/jagregg7916.html">Jane Gregg</a> at the Rosemary Street 
        Presbyterian Church in Belfast. They came to America and settled in Albany 
        during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. These Edgars 
        had at least four children including future Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#ge">resident</a> Gregg Edgar.</p>
		
<p>In 1762, David Edgar was an elder and one of the founding members of 
        the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. 
        By that time, legal papers identified him as a merchant in Albany. </p>
      <p>His business involved a partnership with his brother, William Edgar, and 
        possibly John Macomb. It was anchored in Montreal, Detroit (where David 
        Edgar <a href="http://www.historydetroit.com/people/people.asp?details">voted</a> 
        in 1768), and Albany. David Edgar appeared to be the Albany operative 
        as he sold imported items to frontier customers including Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
        Johnson</a>. During the 1760s and '70s, he was characterized as an "<a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian 
        trader</a>," kept boarders in his Albany home, and was an agent for several 
        frontier enterproises!</p>
      <p>In 1766, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was listed 
        on the Albany assessment roll. The next year, his assessment was in the 
        top five percent of the community. </p>
      <p>In 1771, he joined a number of other Albany men as a partner in <a href="http://herkimer.nygenweb.net/herkpatents.html">Bayard's 
        Patent</a> in what is today Herkimer County. Later that year, David Edgar witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willwmmcew.html">will</a> of an Albany <a href="../irish.html">I</a>rishman and was identified as "of New York." Perhaps this individual had dual residences. </p>
      <p>In 1766, he <a href="../../solconst.html#7917">signed</a> the constitution 
        of the Albany Sons of Liberty. He was elected to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a> in March 1775 and later contributed to the revolutionary 
        movement. 
      <p>David Edgar died in September 1776 leaving substantial property. He had 
        lived in Albany for more than twenty years. His <a href="../g/jagregg7916.html">widow</a> 
        and children lived in Albany for many years after.</p>
