<a href="#sources"><strong>Catherine Elmendorf</strong></a> was born in 1747. <a href="http://www.curatedobject.us/the_curated_object_/2009/03/exhibitionevent-nyc-the-american-wing-galleries-open-at-the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-the-curated-o.html">She</a> was the daughter of Kingston residents Peter/Petrus and Mary Crook Elmendorf. Her father was an Ulster County town leader who died in 1765. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/caelmendorf.jpg" align=left width=220 height=300 border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Catherine Elmendorf about 1752"></a> This recently uncovered portrait of her at age five bears more investigation but has been described <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_5_170/ai_n27073386/">online</a>. Her <a href="peelmen.html">brother</a> also established himself in Albany after the Revolution.

<p>In October 1768, she married Albany native <a href="../b/rubleecker228.html">Rutger Bleecker</a>. By 1788, the mariage may have produced as many as seven children who were christened in Catherine's <a href="../../drc.html">Albany church</a> and elsewhere. The last daughter was born on January 16, 1788 - three months <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part7.html">after</a> the death of her father.

<p>These Bleeckers made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Rutger had begun to establish himself as a businessman. 

<p>Rutger Bleecker died in October 1787. She had been named principal heir and co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willrubleecker228.html">will</a> Bleecker had filed a month earlier.  In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#228">1788</a>, she was identified as the owner of property on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#228">1790</a>, she was listed as the head of her Pearl Street household. A decade later, her household was configured on the <a href="../../census1800.html#228">census</a> for the third ward.

<p>In January <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html">1808</a>, her name appeared on the extensive guest list for a Bleecker family funeral. At that time, perhaps her aged mother-in-law the widow <a href="../s/elstaats4566.html">Elizabeth Staats Bleecker</a> also lived in her house.

<p>In July, a New York newspaper <a href="http://boards.ancestry.myfamily.com/surnames.bleecker/24/mb.ashx">reported</a> the death at Albany of Catherine Elmendorf Bleecker, widow of the late Rutger Bleecker. This Kingston native and Albany wife had lived more than sixty years.
