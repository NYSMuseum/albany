<strong>Anna Everts</strong></a> was the first wife of Albany-area farmer <a href="../vn/hevness911.html">Hendrick Van Ness</a>. They were married in Wiltwyck in October 1663. Perhaps she was a member of the Everts family or was an Everts widow. By 1681, the marriage had produced eight children who were named in Hendrick's pre-nuptual agreement signed in 1688. 

<p>As early as December 1670, Anna Evertse was the defendant in a suit brought by <a href="../s/rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a> over the hiring of a daughter.  

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#nl">1679</a>, the name of "Annetie Evertse" appeared on an assessment roll under the column that stated "The following have not yet any lot." In 1680, she gave testimony before the Albany court and her lot was mentioned. In that year, the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court minutes</a> referred to <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> activity at her house. Later, she was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  

<p>Anna Everts was dead by November 1688 when her husband re-married.</p>
