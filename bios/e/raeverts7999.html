<strong>Rachel Everts</strong></a> was born in November 1710. She was christened on February 4, 1711 at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. She was the daughter of <a href="jaevertse7966.html">Jacob</a> and Elizabeth Hallenbeck Everts. She grew up in a modest home located in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In January 1731, she married Albany native Richard or <a href="../d/jedgarmo809.html">Jellis De Garmo</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, five children had been christened at the church where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These De Garmos lived without much notice over several decades. In 1779, Jellis filed a <a href="../../wills/willjedgarmo809.html">will</a> that named Rachel as sole executrix. By 1788, she was called the widow and the owner of a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7999">first ward</a> property. In 1790, she was <a href="../../census1790.html#7999">named</a> on the census as the head of her household. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1800</a>, she was accounted for on the census in the household of her son, Gerrit.

<p>Widow Rachel Everts De Garmo died in April 1801 and was buried by the Dutch church. She had lived almost ninety-one years.</p>
