<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isabella Ellison</b></a> was the wife and then the widow of the Reverend <a href="tellison.html">Thomas Ellison</a>.</p>


<p>She probably came to Albany with her husband following the War for Independence. He had become the rector of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> now Episcopal church.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#te">1790</a>, their first ward household included eight family members.</p>

<p>Thomas Ellison died in April 1802. Her name appeared on the assessment roll in that year as the owner of a house and lot on Lodge Street with some personal property.</p>

<p>In 1813, the "widow of the late Thomas Ellison" was listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 5 Liberty Steet. The following year her address was given as 37 Chapel Street. After that, her name no longer appeared on Albany rolls.</p>
