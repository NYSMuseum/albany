      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Van Loon</strong></a> was <a href="http://genealogysf.com/Stanton-p/p176.htm#i12697">born</a> 
        in March 1750. He was the son of Petrus and Dirckje De Garmo Van Loon 
        - residents of southern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> 
        (Loonenburg). Both of their great grandfathers had been Albany patriarchs. 
      <p>In September 1772, he married young <a href="../s/chschuyler1254.html">Christina 
        Schuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>. 
        By 1798, eleven children had been christened in the church where he was 
        a lifelong member and church officer. In 1815, he was a member of the 
        <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">Great Consistory</a>. 
      <p>Although the exact nature of his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>time 
        service is not yet clear, afterwards he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6706">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>During the 1770s, he began to acquire Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> 
        - particularly in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. His 
        holdings first were valued on the city assessment rolls in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6706">1779</a>. 
        But in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6706">1788</a>, only his personal 
        property was valued under the third ward store of "Ten Eyck & Bleecker." 
      <p>During the 1780s, he was paid from the city treasury and his properties 
        were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA236&lpg=PA236&dq#PPA505,M1">ref</a>erenced 
        in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6706">1790</a>, his household included 
        seven family members. His home was in the second ward along the road leading 
        west at 84 Lion Street. During the early 1800s, he paid for a tavern owner's 
        license. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">Afterwards</a>, his 
        house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a> was 
        accorded a moderate assessment. 
      <p>Jacob Van Loon lost his wife when Christina died in October 1798 following 
        the birth of her last child. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6706">1800</a>, 
        two boys and two young adults were living in his second ward home. The 
        first <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&vq=loon&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1">city 
        directory</a> listed his residence in the rear of 84 Lion (later Washington) 
        Street. The front of that address was the business of "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&vq=loon&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1#PPA55,M1">Becker 
        & Van Loon</a>, merchants." In that year, he also was identified as an 
        assistant alderman in the second ward. 
      <p>Also, listed in the first few directories, was a second "Jacob Van Loon" 
        at that address. Family members and the widow of Jacob (had old Jacob 
        remarried?) continued to live there into the 1830s. 
      <p>Jacob Van Loon was dead by March 1821 when his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> 
        passed probate. We seek obituary and burial information for this church 
        officer.</p>
