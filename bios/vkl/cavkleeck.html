<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Van Kleeck</b></a> probably was born in the Netherlands about 1639. She was the daughter of Barent Baltus Van Kleeck who <a href="../../nnd.html">emigrated</a> to New Netherland and settled in Flatbush.</p>


<p>About 1660, she married <a href="../vb/pamvbt.html">Paulus Martense Van Benthuysen</a>. The marriage produced at least six children. This Albany family lived in the first ward where they were <a href="../../census1697.html#031">prominent residents</a>.</p>

<p>In March 1682, she was accused but cleared of a charge of accepting stolen goods from two "negroes" who, at that time, were before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a>.</p> 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#cavk">1709</a>, her name ("Cathalina V Benthuysen") appeared on the first ward assessment roll. In December 1717, she was identified as the widow of Paulus Martense and was living in a house on the same street as her daughter, the <a href="../vb/gevbt2318.html">widow</a> of James Parker (Beaver and Green Streets). Catharina Van Kleeck Van Benthuysen died in March 1722 and was buried from the Albany church.</p>
