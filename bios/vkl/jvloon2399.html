<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Jan Van Loon</strong></a> probably was born about 1650. According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, he came to New Netherland  from Luyck in Holland. However, at different times, he was called a "Frenchman" and a "Catholic." In November 1675, "Jan Van Loney" was in New York where he took the <a href="../../nat.html">oath</a> of allegiance to the King of England.

<p>In February 1676, he married Manhattan native Maria Alberts (perhaps <a href="../r/ryckman.html">Ryckman</a>) in New York City. By 1696, the marriage had produced five or more children. He has been <a href="../../res/ts.html">called</a> a Catholic who turned Protestant and donated land for the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church of Loonenburg.

<p>Following his marriage, he relocated to Albany where he bought a lot and was known as a "master smith." By that time, he was looking to acquire land in the upper Hudson Valley. That tract (including today's Coxsackie and Athens) would become known as the "Loonenburg Patent."

<p>Perhaps he was called "Jan Trompetter" and thus appeared on the census of householders in <a href="../../census1679.html#2399">1679</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#2399">1684</a>, his Albany taxes were in arrears but he refused to pay the specified sum. In 1685, he was identified as an Albany merchant.

<p>During the 1680s, he is <a href="../../books.html#don">said</a> to have served as coroner in Albany. In 1688, he was called the "former coroner." In 1701, he was summoned to surrender the papers of the Albany <a href="../vi/ajvilp.html">notary</a> from the 1680s. However, he did not turn over Van Ilpendam's records until 1702.  

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#2399">1697</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and he was identified as a "papist."

<p>During the seventeenth century, Van Loon owned property and <a href="http://threerivershms.com/hvvanews4-4b.gif">homes</a> at Loonenburg (today's Athens).

<p>In September 1691, his Albany house was robbed. He also may have owned a house in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. As late as 1715, he appeared before the Albany court.

<p>A "Jan Van Loon" was listed on the Albany assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#jvl">1709</a>. Jan Van Loon (the emigre) was dead by 1720. His son and namesake (1685-1743) lived in and around Albany at different times. </p>
