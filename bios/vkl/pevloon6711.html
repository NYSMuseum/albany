<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter Van Loon</strong></a> was born early in 1775. He was the son of <a href="javloon6706.html">Jacob</a> and <a
 href="../s/chschuyler1254.html">Christina Schuyler</a> Van Loon. He was the eldest surviving son of a large Albany family and grew up in a businessman's <a href="../../census1790.html#6706">home</a> on Lion Street.
 
<p>By 1798, he had married Albany native <a href="../w/sawendell2717.html">Sara Wendell</a>. Beginning in that year, their children (perhaps nine or more) were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#6711">1800</a>, his household was configured on the census of the second ward. Over the next decades, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">city census</a> returns document the growth and maturation of his family. <a href="../../cbr.html">Community-based resources</a> note this <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#6711">main</a>liner as a merchant, store keeper, fireman, and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=%22peter+van+loon,+john+boardman+and+others%22&source=bl&ots=SrdsUOukAk&sig=CBwab_te9uU3arERDX2fmJWiAH4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifueDii8fRAhUN82MKHXQ_BYIQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20van%20loon%2C%20john%20boardman%20and%20others%22&f=false">aspiring bank</a> director. Perhaps he <a href="http://elections.lib.tufts.edu/catalog/tufts:ny.assessor4.albany.1816">served</a> in a number of municipal offices as well.

<p>City <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment rolls</a> for the period consistently valued his real property on State, Lion, and Lydius Streets.




<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22van+loon%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22van%20loon%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory noted that he was a merchant living at 46 State Street and that he died in 1852. By <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1816</a>, the directory showed that he had relocated his residence to 50 <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius Street</a> and that his store was located at 48 State Street. As late as 1830, the directory identified him simply as "P. Van Loon" on "Lydius."

<p>In <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/8054/4196759-00292?pid=11180127&backurl=http://mv.ancestry.com/viewer/4196759-00292/23814566/13139566127&usePUB=true&_phsrc=eQU143&_phstart=default&usePUBJs=true">1850</a>, the Federal census identified him as a resident of the third ward, aged 75, living with Sarah (age 74), and the owner of real property valued at "35,000."

<p>Peter Van Loon is said to have died in March 1852. His will passed probate in Albany that April. His <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=van+loon&GSfn=peter&GSiman=1&GScid=63827&GRid=78435660&">gravestone</a> at Albany Rural Cemetery was erected by his children would mark the particulars of his and Sara's lives. </p>
