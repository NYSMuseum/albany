<strong>Jacob Gerritse Van Laer</strong></a> was born in the manor of Ruynem in Drente and emigrated to New Netherland.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6695">1660</a>, his name appeared on a petition of fur traders seeking more latitude in dealing with the Indians.

<p>This individual does not seem to have married but did have a number of surviving siblings.

<p>In October 1674, he was among those <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#6695">invited</a> to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer.

<p>During the 1670s, he appeared before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> on a number of matters. At that time, he was identified as a tailor. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6695">1679</a>, his landmark house was listed on a census of Albany householders. In 1681, he was included among the Albany burghers who were consulted regarding the calling of a new minister for the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.


<p>"A little sick of body," Jacob Gerritse Van Laer filed a <a href="../../wills/willjagvlaer.html">will</a> in July 1684. No wife or children were named but his entire estate was left to his brother, sisters, and their children. The will noted his house in Albany.</p>
