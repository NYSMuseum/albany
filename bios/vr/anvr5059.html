<P><A href="#biography"><B>Anna Van Rensselaer</B></A> was born in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in January 1696. She was the fourth daughter of the eleven children born to <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8627.html">Catharina Van Brugh</a> Van Rensselaer. She grew up in the Albany home of a prominent businessman and official and also at their country seat across the river.</P>

<P>In October 1717, her father's Albany home was the site of her marriage to promising <a href="../d/pedouw2164.html">Petrus Douw</a> of Rensselaerswyck. All <a href="../d/pedouwfam.html">nine</a> of their children born between 1718 and 1736 <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#douw">survived</a> to further connect the families within the upper Hudson region. She was the mother of Albany mayor, <a href="../d/vopdouw2234.html">Volkert P. Douw</a>.</P>

          <p>During Anna's childbearing years, her growing family resided in one 
            of the Douw houses on lower State Street. By the 1740s, Petrus had 
            built a country home called <a href="../d/douw.html#wol">Wolvenhook</a> 
            on a choice riverside location within her father's manor. As time 
            passed, however, these Douws would spend more and more time in their 
            Greenbush home.</p>

<p>Anna Van Rensselaer died in April 1756 at age sixty. She was buried from the Albany Dutch Church. Her husband survived for another nineteen years.</p>
