<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Elsie Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was born in February 1758. She was the daughter of <a href="kvr5131.html">Kiliaen</a> and <a href="../s/arschuyler.html">Ariaantie Schuyler</a> Van Rensselaer. She was a younger child in a large family and was raised on the family farm in the part of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> called <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html#greenbush">Greenbush</a>. However, her mother would die giving birth in 1763 and, six years later, her father remarried.
 
<p>Five years later, Elsie was not yet fifteen when, in September 1774, she married <a href="../l/ablansing3694.html">Abraham A. Lansing</a> - an Albany businessman who was almost eight years older than his bride. Six months later, the first of her ten children was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Her last child was baptized in November 1794. 

<p>These Lansings would <a href="../../census1790.html#3694">live</a> on <a href="../../census1800.html#3694">Market Street</a> in a house attended by many slaves. They also also spent some time at her brother's farm on <a href="pvr.html#farm">Cherry Hill</a>.

      <p>Elsie Van Rensselaer Lansing died in March 1796 at the age of thirty-nine and 
        was buried at Cherry Hill. Her husband soon remarried and lived until 
        1822. <br>
