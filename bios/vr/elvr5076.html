<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was born in August 1770. She was the daughter of <a href="pvr.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../s/masanders1438.html">Maria Sanders</a> Van Rensselaer. She grew up an older daughter in the very large family of a merchant living on Pearl Street and then on family land at <a href="pvr.html#farm">Cherry Hill</a>.</p>

<p>In September 1802, she became the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/peteredmundelmendorfhiswives/">second wife</a> of Kingston native Peter <a href="../e/peelmen.html">Elmendorf</a> when they were married at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1815, that marriage had produced six children.  Elmendorf's first wife also was named Elizabeth Van Rensselaer and was the mother of his first two children.

<p>Elmendorf was an attorney practicing from their home at what became 66 North Pearl Street. Their house is said to have been left to her by Elizabeth's mother.

<p> On April 1835, the Albany newspaper <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA341&lpg=PA241&dq=%22+apoplexy&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=elmendorf&f=false">noted her death</a> from apoplexy at the age of fifty eight.  Her husband, Peter E. Elmendorf, died a month after her at the age of seventy. Initially buried at Cherry Hill, today their <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=102214493">remains reside</a> at the <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.
