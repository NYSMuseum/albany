<strong>Nicholas Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was born in December 1754. He was the third son in the large family of <a href="kvr5131.html">Kiliaen</a> and his first wife, <a href="../s/arschuyler.html">Ariaantie Schuyler</a> Van Rensselaer. He was named for his maternal <a href="../s/nischuyler1730.html">grandfather</a>. He grew up on his father's farm in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">East Manor</a>. His mother died in 1763, and his father re-married a few years later. Two <a href="pvr.html">brothers</a> became prominent Albany <a href="kvr5092.html">residents</a>.

<p>Following the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> in 1775, he was commissioned a lieutenant and then captain in the First and Second (?) New York <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">regiments</a>. He saw considerable action in support of the American cause. He is said to have carried the news of Burgoyne's surrender to Albany. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_GwsAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq">said</a> to have retired from the army in January 1781. Later, he was allotted military land grants which he seems to have bought and sold to his advantage.  After the war, he continued to serve - ultimately reaching the rank of Colonel in the New York State militia.  

<p>In November 1780, he married <a href="../vb/elvburen.html">Elsie Van Buren</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1785, two children had been christened in Albany. Over the next decade, two more children were <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/gbrcbv.htm">baptized</a> at the Reformed church in Greenbush.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, he owned a lot in Albany's first ward. In 1816, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> gave his address as 66 Lydius Street. Otherwise, he probably lived in Greenbush.

<p>In July 1818, he was among the former Revolutionary war officers who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq">carried</a> the remains of "General Montgomery in a procession thru Albany.

<p>In 1840, his name was included on a <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/colonial/census/1840/1840ny_v.html">list</a> of Revolutionary war pensioners. At that time, he was an eighty-nine-year-old resident of Greenbush. His wife died in 1844. Nicholas Van Rensselaer died in March 1848. This "revolutionary soldier" had lived ninety-four years.
