<P><b>T</b>his engaging <a href="#portrait">portrait</a> entitled "Boy of the Van Rensselaer Family" is thought to have been painted by <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish born limner 
        <a href="../h/joheaton.html">John Heaton</a> probably during the 1730s when the artist was living and working in Albany. It is unique in the <a href="../../cuyler.html">visual record</a> of early Albany.<a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/boyvr.jpg" align=right vspace=4 hspace=4 width=250 border=1 alt="Boy of the Van Rensselaer family"></a> 
        It also is the only contemporary image of an eighteenth century <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro 
        Albanian</a> that we have thus far encountered!</p>
      <p>This portrait depicts a relationship documented in the <a href="../../pcalhindex.html#wills">wills</a> 
        of early Albany people which allocated slaves to the children and other 
        kin of the testator. </p>
      <p>The Van Rensselaer child was probably less than five years old and could 
        be a number of individuals who were born during the 1720s and 30s. Since 
        the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Van Rensselaers</a> were  among the largest and longest tenured slaveholders with servants <a href="../../census1790.html#psvr">in Albany</a> and on 
        the <a href="../../census1790.html#svr3">manor</a>, many more possibilities 
        exist for the identity of the older Afro-Albanian boy. Although personal 
        servants were considered part of the master's household, the relative 
        grandeur of their clothing helps signify the difference in their status. 
        Anne Grant recalled the relationship in her <a href="../../art/grant.html#aa"><i>Memoirs 
        of an American Lady</i></a>. We continually puzzle after the identities 
        of the principals in this important resource!</p>
      <p>This appears to be the only known likeness of an eighteenth-century <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro-Albanian</a>! 
        James Eights's <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">streetscape</a> set in 
        the early 1800s has given us a representation we believe to be Afro-Albanian 
        matriarch <a href="../j/djackson1074.html">Dinnah Jackson</a>. </p>

<p><a name=portrait></a><b>Portrait:</b> Copy of Heaton's painting copied from a plate reproduced in <a href="../../books.html#patria"><i>Patria</i></a> and explained therein. The 45 X 35 oil painting has been dated to the 1730s. See p. 196. A slightly differently titled and more graphic <a href="http://american-arcadia.hudsonvalley.org/content/slavery3">online</a> reproduction and explanation contains additional information including that it is in a "private collection." Once a staple of topical presentations, over the past two decades this image seems to have been less frequently utilized. This is <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzling</a>! Perhaps the recently published <a href="http://www.upress.state.ms.us/books/1997"><i>The Pinkster King</i></a> will be instructive.
