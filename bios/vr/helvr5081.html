<strong>Helena Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was born in October 1702. She was a younger daughter of Albany leaders <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8627.html">Catharina Van Brugh</a> Van Rensselaer. Shortly thereafter, Hendrick relocated his family to a new home he built on recently allocated property across the Hudson in an area known as <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html#greenbush">Greenbush</a>. Thus, Helena probably grew up at the <a href="https://parks.ny.gov/historic-sites/30/fees-rates.aspx">still standing</a> riverside home called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Crailo">Crailo</a>.

<p>In December 1728, she married Albany native <a href="../w/jawendell2697.html">Jacob Wendell</a> at he Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1745, eight children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Wendells lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Jacob was a businessman and emerging civic leader.


<p>Jacob Wendell died in September 1745 - several months after the birth of her last child. In her early forties, Helena then became head of their third ward household and was identified as "Widow Wynndall" on a census of Albany households taken by the British army in <a href="../../census1756.html#56">1756</a> and on at least one subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment roll</a>. She appears to have lived near the homes of her children and grandchildren. Over time, she probably would have lived with one or more of them.

<p>Widow Helena Van Rensselaer Wendell is thought to have survived until January 1792. Thus, she would have lived almost ninety years.</p>

The life of Helena <a href="vr.html">Van Rensselaer</a> Wendell is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 5081. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. With a number of "Widow Wendells" heading Albany households during the second half of the eighteenth, we must be careful not to confuse and compress information about them.
