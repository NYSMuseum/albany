<P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/psvrbust.jpg" align=left border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=150 alt="Philip S. Van Rensselaer"><A href="#biography"><B>Philip S. Van Rensselaer</B></A> was born n
            in April 1766. He was the second of three children born to <a href="svr5114.html">Stephen 
            II</a> and his wife <a href="../l/calivingston5034.html">Catharina 
            Livingston</a> Van Rensselaer. His older brother was <a href="svr3.html">Stephen 
            Van Rensselaer</a> and his sister, <a href="elvr5075.html">Elizabeth</a>, furthered the Van Rensselaer 
            name with marriages into the Schuyler and Bleecker families.</p>

          <p>Losing his father in 1769, the boy grew up at the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor 
            House</a> supported by an extensive and advantaged family. His mother 
            re-married in 1775 - bringing her new husband, Dominie <a href="../w/ewesterlo.html">Eilardus 
            Westerlo</a>, into Philip's young life.</p>

          <P>While his older brother assumed the title of lord of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, 
            Philip became a merchant and was headquartered in Albany. He was able 
            to use his legacies to invest in a number of business ventures and 
            was a prominent member and officer of a number of banking, insurance, 
            transportation, and civic improvement organizations.</P>

<p>In 1787, he married Westchester native <a href="../vc/andpvc.html">Anne De Peyster Van Cortlandt</a> - daughter of the state's first lieutenant governor. Anticipating a large family, Philip built a grand home on upper <a href="../../loc/statestreet.html">State Street</a>. However, the union produced no children. As early as <a href="../../census1790.html#psvr">1790</a>, 
            his large home at 87 State was attended by five <a href="#slaves">slaves</a>. A decade later, his <a href="../../census1800.html#5106">household</a> included six slaves.</p>


<p><a name=home><a href="#painting"><img src="../../images/jpg/eightspsvrhse.jpg" align=left border=0 width=300 vspace=0 hspace=6 alt="Van Rensselaer's house from a James Eights painting"></a> <a name=mansion>He entered city government in 1793 as an alderman for the first ward. In 1798, he was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html#rs">mayor</a> of Albany. He was re-appointed annually until 1816 when he was replaced by relative newcomer <a href="../j/eljenkins.html">Elisha Jenkins</a> in a politically motivated move. However, he was mayor again from 1819 to 1821. Over his long tenure, Albany underwent a dramatic transformation. With roots set deeply into Albany's past, as an important member of the post-revolutionary business community, and well-connected across a range of social and cultural institutions, Philip S. Van Rensselaer understood these diverse and potentially conflicting imperatives and was able to help orchestrate the city's development over two key decades.</p>

          <p>He owned a number of storehouses, space along the Albany waterfront, and a 
            flour and plaster mill along the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Normanskill</a> 
            - both of which were destroyed by fire in 1820.</P>

<p>His long public and business <a href="../../inprog.html">careers</a> were substantial and complex. But both are largely <a href="../../cbr.html#parameters">beyond the scope</a> of our basic inquiry!</p>

<p>Mayor of Albany for almost twenty years, Philip S. Van Rensselaer died on September 25, 1824 at age fifty-eight. This city father was buried from his residence at State and Chapel  Streets.</p>

      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 5106. The historical record often 
            refers to him as "Philip Schuyler Van Rensselaer." This profile is 
            derived chiefly from <a href="../../fhg.html#fvr">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. As with all mayors of the city, the life and tenure 
            of Philip S. Van Rensselaer has been profiled by Cuyler Reynolds in 
            his <a href="../../books.html#ac"><i>Albany Chronicles</i></a>, pp. 
            388-400.</p>
