<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Van Rensselaer</b></a> was born in October 1673. She was the daughter of Jeremias and Maria Van Cortlandt Van Rensselaer. Her father was the lord of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> but died the year after her birth. Her mother died in 1689, leaving her an orphan at the age of sixteen.</p>

<p>As a member of two of the most prominent landed families in colonial New York, Maria figured to be an extremely desirable <a href="../../marriages.html">marriage partner</a> Her brother was Albany businessman <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a>.</p>


<p>In September 1691 she was just eighteen-years-old when she became the second wife of Albany leader <a href="../s/pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a> - perhaps the most prominent native Albanian. Only <a href="../s/mgtschuyler1486.html">one child</a> had survived from Schuyler's first marriage. But by 1698, Maria bore five children - all of whom survived to adulthood.</p>

<p>These Schuylers lived in his house on <a href="../../loc/court.html">Court Street</a> and spent considerable time at the country estates of <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">both</a> of their <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">families</a>. Like her husband, Maria was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and a frequent baptism sponsor.</p> 



<p>Three months before her fortieth birthday, Maria Van Rensselaer Schuyler died in the morning on July 25, 1713. Her famous husband lived until 1724.</p>
