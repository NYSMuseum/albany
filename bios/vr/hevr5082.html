<strong>Hendrick Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was was born in April of 1712. He was the son<a href="#son">*</a> of <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8627.html">Catharina Van Brugh</a> Van Rensselaer. He was a younger son in a large family that enjoyed Hendrick's prosperity and prominence in Albany and across the river at Crailo. 

<p>In October 1735, he married Elizabeth Van Brugh in New York City. That marriage produced nine children before her death in 1753. In November 1762, he married the widow <a href="http://www.iment.com/maida/familytree/henry/bios/gilbertlivingstoncornelia.htm#alida">Alida Livingston</a> Rutsen. He was fifty and she was forty-six. 

<p>This Hendrick Van Rensselaer made his home on family property at Claverack - the country home of his large, combined family. He was a landholder, businessman, <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> officer, and representative of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manorial</a> interests at the local and provincial levels. He was wounded in the tenant "riots" of 1766.

<p>In December 1776, he was named heir and co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willelvr5067.html">will</a> of his sister. At that time, he was absolved of any remaining debts to her. 

<P>Hendrick Van Rensselaer died at his Claverack home in July 1793. He had lived seventy-one years. </p>

The life of Hendrick Van Rensselaer is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 5082. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.

<p><dd><a name=son> This sketch is conservative in hopes of not confusing this individual with a number of same-named contemporaries. His father died in 1740. Sung Bok Kim has identified this Henry as "Hendrick Jr." and has <a href="../../books.html#sbk">shed light</a> on his Claverack career.
