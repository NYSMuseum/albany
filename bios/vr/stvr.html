<strong>Stephen Van Rensselaer</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Stephanus) was born in March 1707. He was the second son of <a href="kvr5054.html">Kiliaen</a> and <a href="../vc/mavc.html">Maria Van Cortlandt</a> Van Rensselaer. His father was the Patroon and he grew up at the Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> located north of Albany.
<p>In 1717, the <a href="../../wills/willkvr5054.html">will</a> filed by his father specified that he would succeeded to the patroonship on the demise of his older brother. A provision that would come to fruition three decades late. He also was left monetary and real property bequests from his father's estate.

<p>In July 1729, he married Albany native <a href="../g/elgroesbeck3292.html">Elizabeth Groesbeck</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1742, six children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#stvr">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of freeholders living in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>On the death of his heirless brother, Jeremias, in 1745, Stephanus became lord of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. Sickly, he was unable to play a strong role in the development of the manor. 

<p>Stephen Van Rensselaer died at home in July 1747 at the age of forty. His <a href="../../wills/willstvr.html">will</a>, filed just before his death, detailed a substantial estate. His widow survived until 1756. Their <a href="svr5114.html">son</a> succeeded his father as Patroon.</p>

<strong>Sources:</strong>  Because neither he nor his father really actually lived in the <a href="../../criteria.html">city</a> of Albany, the life of this Stephen <a href="vr.html">Van Rensselaer</a> has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a>
