<P><A href="#biography"><B>Philip Van Rensselaer</B></A> was born in May 1747. He was the second son and the ninth child born to <a href="kvr5131.html">Kiliaen Van Rensselaer</a> of Greenbush and the East <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> and his first wife, Schenectady native <a href="../s/arschuyler.html">Ariaantie Schuyler</a> Van Rensselaer. He was the grandson of onetime city father, <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van  Rensselaer</a>.</p>

          <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/pvrcolor.jpg" border=0 vspace=1 hspace=1 alt="miniature of Philip Van Rensselaer" width=175 heigth=235 align=left></a>Initially, 
            his career path was less defined by the mighty Van Rensselaers and 
            instead came through the Sanders family when he married <a href="../s/masanders1438.html">Maria</a>, 
            daughter of <a href="../s/rosanders1443.html">Robert Sanders</a> 
            in February 1768. The first of their twelve children was born that 
            December. By 1793, eleven more Van Rensselaer children were baptized 
            in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents 
            were members.</P>

<P>These Van Rensselaers took up residence in the family house on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> from where Philip carried on his late father-in-law's extensive and complex businesses. Like Sanders, he was primarily an importer of West Indian products, cloths, and metalware - accepting farm and forest products in return. For twenty years, he was a well-known Albany storekeeper. During that time, he shipped cargoes along the river on his own sloop. He also began to develop a farm on Van Rensselaer land running back from the river and south of the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a>.</P>

          <p>Philip Van Rensselaer was an early supporter of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade 
            for American liberties</a>. Following his father to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
            of Correspondence</a>, he was elected as a member for the second ward 
            beginning in May 1776. He served through the life of the committee 
            and proved a valuable liaison with the supply side of the war effort. 
            Previously, he had served the ill-fated Canadian invasion - corresponding 
            and transacting business with family and associates on duty to the 
            North.</p>

<p>By that time, he had been appointed <a href="#storekeeper">storekeeper</a> by <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">General Schuyler</a> and placed in charge of ordnance and other important military supplies. During the war, he kept the "public storehouse" and at one time had charge of ten men. What became an artillery park south of the city probably was located on his land - which was under development and constituted at least a seasonal residence!</p>

<p>With the coming of peace, Van  Rensselaer maintained a broad-based  profile - maintaining his Albany store and using the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#pvr">Pearl Street</a> home to be elected alderman for the second ward of Albany beginning in 1782. <a name=home></a>During the 1780s, he also purchased several parcels within the city, leased a tavern on property five miles west of the Hudson, speculated in land north and east of Albany, and continued to develop the <a href="#farm">farm</a> <a name=cherry></a> known as "Cherry Hill."</p>

          <p>About 1787, he built a new home on the South Albany property - replacing an earlier structure that previously had been the home of <a href="../h/hiholland.html">Hitchen 
            Holland</a> and then Holland's son-in-law, <a href="../vs/hvschaack.html">Henry 
            Van Schaack</a>. That Georgian mansion survives today as a <a href="http://www.historiccherryhill.org/">historic 
            house museum</a>. By 1790, his Cherry Hill farm was approaching a 
            thousand acres and featured a tannery and brew house. His household 
            was a prominant feature on the <a href="../../census1790.html#5105">census</a> 
            for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> with ten family 
            members and five slaves. He was elected to be the first supervisor 
            of the new town of <a ><a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> 
            in 1794.</a></p>

<p>Philip Van Rensselaer filed a will early in 1798. It provided for his wife and eleven living children. He died on March 3 - two months shy of his fifty-first birthday. <a href="../s/masanders1438.html">Maria 
            Sanders</a> Van Rensselaer and her children resided at Cherry Hill 
            until her death in 1824.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Philip Van Rensselaer</B> is 
            CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 5105. This profile is derived 
            chiefly from <a href="../../fhg.html#fvr">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
            resources</a>. An additional and very useful study is Roderic H. Blackburn, 
            <i>Cherry Hill: The History and Collections of a Van Rensselaer Family</i> 
            (Albany, 1976). This thoughtful and well-illustrated work provides 
            background narrative on the Van Rensselaer family, tells the story 
            of the Cherry Hill property, and catalogs its collection. Particularly 
            enlightening and <a href="../../inprog.html">intriguing</a> are its 
            discussions of the material culture of Van Rensselaer and his family. 
            No bibliography of the Van Rensselaers would be complete without noting 
            Catharina V. R. Bonney's <a href="../../sources.html#lhg"><i>A Legacy 
            of Historical Gleanings,</i></a>, a compendium of useful family materials.</p>

<p><a name=portrait></a>Copy of a <b>Miniature</b> of Philip Van Rensselaer undated but attributed to New York City-based Irish miniature painter John Ramage. It is in the collection of <a href="http://www.artcom.com/museums/nv/gl/12202-11.htm">Historic Cherry Hill</a>. This offering has been adapted from the Philip Van Rensselaer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Philip-Van-Rensselaer-183929721622581/">Facebook</a> page. It also appears in and is described in Blackburn, <i>Cherry Hill</i>, p. 48.</p>

<p><a name=storekeeper></a><b>Storekeeper:</b> The exact nature of Van Rensselaer's appointment or commission is elusive. At various times he was referred to as the "storekeeper," "public storekeeper," "storekeeper for the army," and as the "Deputy Commissary of Stores and keeper of the armory." A descendant said he was appointed in May 1776. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> more definitive documentation on his service.</p>

Blackburn, <i>Cherry Hill: the History and Collections of a Van Rensselaer Family</i> (1976), chapter 2. See also, pp. 153-54 for the building of Cherry Hill in 1787. Located on choice <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Van Rensselaer</a> land but <a href="../../citylimits.html">outside</a> the city of Albany until 1872, Cherry Hill does not fall within the official <a href="../../criteria.html">scope</a> of concern of the Colonial Albany Project! However, the historic property has opened a nifty <a href="http://www.historiccherryhill.org/collections/">archive and research center</a> with many state-of-the-art features. Similarly, its extensive <a href="http://www.historiccherryhill.org/collections/">collection</a> represents an unparalled resource for Albany family history.</p>
