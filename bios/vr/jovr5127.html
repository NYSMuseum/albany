<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Van Rensselaer</b></a> was born in January 1708. He was the son of <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8627.html">Catharina Van Brugh</a> Van Rensselaer of Albany and the lower <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>.</p>


<p>He married <a href="../l/enlivingston5014.html">Engeltie Livingston</a> at the Albany Dutch church in January 1734. The marriage produced six children before her death in 1747. He then 
<a href="#vc">may have married</a> Gertrude Van Cortlandt.</p>

<p>These Van Rensselaers lived at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Crailo">Crailo</a> in a landmark house built by his father and inherited by John in 1740. About 1762, he added a wing and remodelled the property. On the death of his father, he became proprietor or lord of the lower or "Claverack" manor of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. During the mid 1760s, his Greenbush holdings alone were about three times as valuable as any others in the entire east Manor. He owned a <a href="../../wills/willjovr.html#house">house and ground</a> in the city of Albany. He also owned shares in tracts of land outside the manor.</p>

<p>During the third quarter of the eighteenth century. the Lower Manor was encroached on by New Englanders with Massachusetts titles to Van Rensselaer's lands. John fought them in the courts and the prolonged battle took its toll on the aging manor lord. He also called on the Albany <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> to evict the squatters - an initiative that led to bloodshed. Throughout that time, he was a colonel in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.</p>

<p>"Weak in body," John Van Rensselaer filed his <a href="../../wills/willjovr.html">will</a> in July 1782. It devised an extensive estate to his children and grandchildren. He died at Crailo in February 1783. He had lived seventy-five years. His son was future New York State Lieutenant Governor <a href="jevr5085.html">Jeremiah Van Rensselaer</a> His only surviving <a href="cavr.html">daughter</a> married General <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a>. </p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of John Van Rensselaer is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 5127. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../fhg.html#fvr">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. See his affidavit from 1755 printed in <a href="../../sources.html#dhny"><i>DHNY</i></a>, vol 3, pp. 466-67. Sung Bok Kim has cast John's career as that of a somewhat passive plantation proprietor.
