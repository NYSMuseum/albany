<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Hendrick Van Rensselaer</b></A> was born in Greenbush in 1667. He was the second son of <a href="jevr.html">Jeremias</a> Van Rensselaer - head of his family's extensive holdings in America. His mother was <a href="../vc/mavc.html">Maria Van Cortlandt</a> - daughter of one of the most prominent Manhattan merchants. Enduring the <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#5053">loss</a> of his father in 1674 and his mother fifteen years later, Hendrick was raised under a family umbrella controlled mostly by the Van Cortlandts.</P>

          <p>Two months after the death of his mother in 1689, Hendrick married <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8627.html">Catharina 
            Van Brugh</a> - whose father also was a prosperous New York businessman. 
            Following the birth of their first child that same year, the couple 
            relocated to Albany where their last ten children were baptized in 
            the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany Dutch church</a>. Almost immediately, 
            Hendrick became a church mainstay - sponsoring more than two dozen 
            baptisms, serving as an elder, and auditing the church's books.</p> 

          <P>Over the next decade, these Van Rensselaers were <a href="../../census1697.html#094">mainline</a> 
            Albany residents in every sense of the word. Standing in the shadow 
            of his older brother, <a href="kvr5054.html">Kiliaen</a> - who became lord of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, 
            Hendrick was known as an Albany merchant, <a href="#store">storekeeper</a>, 
            and part owner of a ship that traded in the West Indies. In 1695, 
            twenty-eight-year-old Hendrick was elected to the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">city 
            council</a> as an alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html">first 
            ward</a>. Four the next five years, he sat on the council and city 
            court. In 1698, he purchased land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> 
            from the Indians on Albany's behalf. In 1707, he sold that patent 
            to the city.</P>

<p>In 1704, his life changed when Rensselaerswyck was partitioned with the southern and eastern portions known as the "Lower Manor" going to Hendrick. Before long, Hendrick Van Rensselaer and his family left Albany - setting down roots across the river in a new home called "Crailo."</p>

<p>In 1705, Hendrick Van Rensselaer was elected to represent Rensselaerswyck in the New York General Assembly. Re-elected four times, he served until 1715. During that time (from 1706 thru 1734), he was listed on the roster of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>.

<p>As time passed, he retreated to his country home - leaving the active development of the "Lower Manor" to his sons, <a href="jovr5127.html">Johannes</a> and Hendrick. Hendrick Van Rensselaer died at his Greenbush home in July 1740 at age seventy-four. He was buried from the Albany Dutch church.</P>
