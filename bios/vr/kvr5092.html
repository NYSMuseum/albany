<P> Attorney and Congressman, Albany resident <a href="#sources">
<strong>Kiliaen K. Van Rensselaer</strong></a> (Killian K. Van Rensselaer) was born in June 1763. He was the ninth and last child of <a href="kvr5131.html">Kiliaen</a> and <a href="../s/arschuyler.html">Ariaantie Schuyler</a> Van Rensselaer. His mother died four months after Kiliaen's birth. His father remarried in 1769. Kiliaen K. grew up in an otherwise large family on his father's <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Greenbush</a> estate. His father died in December 1781 when this youngest son was little past eighteen. 

<p>For a time, he was said to have been the secretary of General <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a>. 

<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/kkvr.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200 alt="Kiliaen K. Van Rensselaer - 1805"></a>But this youngest son of a landed family was being groomed for a career in the <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>. He attended Yale College. A college letter to his <a href="pvr.html">brother</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x0QFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg#PPA122,M1">later</a> correspondences  can be read <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x0QFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg">online</a>. Returning home, he was admitted to the New York Bar in 1784. He opened a law office at Claverack - where young clerks learned the basics of legal practice. He appeared  in various courts in Columbia County, was county surrogate in 1786, and was commissioned "brigade Inspector" in the Columbia County militia. 

<p>In January 1791, he married <a href="../s/mgtsanders1870.html">Margaret Sanders</a> in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. By 1801, the marriage had produced five children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a church officer. This union further cemented the ties between elite families as his <a href="pvr.html">older  brother</a> already had married Margaret's <a href="../s/masanders1438.html">cousin</a>. 

<p>Following the marriage, the Van Rensselaers established their base <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">residence</a> at 116 <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">State Street</a> - a property that came to them <a href="../../wills/willjosanders.html">from</a> the Sanders family. He later erected a large home on that site. In <a href="../../census1800.html#5092">1800</a>, his first ward household included ten family members and was served by two slaves. He maintained that home for many years - although his congressional career took him to Washington.
<p>In 1797, he was one of the proprietors of the Hamilton Glass Company.

<p>A Federalist, he was elected to Congress in 1801 and <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=V000054">served</a> in the House of Representatives until 1811.

<p>Following his congressional career, he returned to Albany where he served on the city Council and continued to practice law at his 116 State Street address. He served as a trustee of the Albany Academy.

<p>Kiliaen K. Van Rensselaer lost his wife in April 1830. He lived for fifteen more years and died in June 1845 at the age of eighty-two. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">Letters</a> of Administration were granted on his estate in September. His son, John Sanders Van Rensselaer, succeeded to his legal practice.</p>
