<strong>Jeremias Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was born in May 1632. He was the son of West India Company director <a href="kvr.html">Killiaen</a> Van Rensselaer and his second wife,  Anna Wely. His illustrious father died in 1643. Jeremias emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> - first in 1654. He returned home and crossed again in 1656.

<p>Jeremias Van Rensselaer succeeded to the title of Patroon and Director of the colony of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> on the death of his brother in 1658. In 1659, he contracted to have a stone house built for him. At that time, he owned a lot in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> as well.</p>

<p>Although a leading scholar has <a href="../../books.html#jv">offered</a> that the Van Rensselaers were involved in "the trade," the names of neither Jan Baptiste nor Jeremias appeared on <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">lists</a> of fur traders who petitioned the court in 1660. Perhaps they were exempt from the problems facing the <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>-based business community.

<p>In July 1662, Jeremias Van Rensselaer married young <a href="../vc/mvc.html">Maria Van Corlandt</a> at the Dutch <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> in New Amsterdam. By 1674, this marriage of advantaged New Yorkers had produced seven children, several of whom would further establish their families on the top shelf of colonial society. His sons became prominent Albany residents - at least for a part of their lives.

<p>In October 1664, Jeremias was among the Holland-born settlers who took the <a href="../../nat.html">oath</a> of allegiance to the King of England.

<p>Jeremias Van Rensselaer died in October 1674. His subsequent funeral was <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html">attended</a> by the most worthy settlers of Albany and Rensselaerswyck. His widow survived until 1689.
