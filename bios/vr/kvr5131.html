<P><a href="#sources"><b>Kiliaen Van Rensselaer</b></a> was born in November 1717. He was the youngest of the eleven children born to <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8627.html">Catharina Van Brugh</a> Van Rensselaer. The families of both his parents reflected New York's commercial and landed elites.</p>


<p>He married Schenectady native <a href="../s/arschuyler.html">Ariaantie Schuyler</a> in January 1742. Before her death in 1763, the marriage had produced nine children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. In September 1769, Kiliaen was approaching fifty-two when he married Maria Low of New Jersey. Several of his <a href="pvr.html">sons</a> became <a href="kvr5092.html">prominent</a> residents of the region. His <a href="mavr5100.html">daughter</a> married <a href="../g/leogans4667.html">Leonard Gansevoort, Jr.</a>

<p>He was a gentleman farmer and landlord. Marriages and <a href="../../wills/willelvr5067.html">inheritances</a> brought him additional landholdings on the east side of the Hudson River. He lived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> - to the east of and overlooking Papsknee Island. </p>

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he represented Rensselaerswyck on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. He also served as colonel of the Fourth Regiment (Rensselaerswyck battalion) of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>Kiliaen Van Rensselaer died in December 1781 at the age of sixty-four. </p>
