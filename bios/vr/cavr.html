<P><A href="#biography"><B>Catherine Van Rensselaer</B></A> was born 1734. She was the eldest daughter of <a href="jovr5127.html">John Van Rensselaer</a> and his wife <a href="../l/enlivingston5014.html">Engeltie Livingston</a>. Her father was lord of the lower or Claverack Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">M</a>anor.</P>

<P><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/cavrsepia.jpg" width=200 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=1 align=right alt="Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler"></a>"Kitty" Van Rensselaer grew into a young <a href="#description">"</a>lady of great beauty, shape, and gentility.<a href="#description">"</a> She was a frequent visitor to the Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">homes</a> in Albany and down the valley to New York where she was introduced to the sons of New York's most important families. Daughter of a landed aristocrat, this "dark and slender beauty" would be a <a href="../../marriages.html">fitting mate</a> for a number of up-and-coming and appropriate young men.</p>

          <p>She had known Albany's <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> 
            for several years when they came together in a relationship that culminated 
            in their marriage in September 1755 at the Albany Dutch Church. Approaching 
            her twenty-first birthday, Kitty would give birth to the first of 
            her fifteen children just five months later. At that time, her husband 
            was an officer in the provincial army and she had moved to Albany 
            and into the life of its most prominent native son.</P>

          <p>By end of 1761, her family now included four children. These Schuylers 
            had removed from Albany's <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">busiest 
            location</a> to a large and newly built <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">mansion</a> 
            located on a hill south of and overlooking the core city. This would 
            be Catherine Schuyler's lifelong home. For the next forty years, she 
            would be the grand dame of Albany's most regal location where dignitaries 
            from Baron Dieskau to George Washington were frequent visitors.</p>

          <p>As Philip Schuyler's business, military, and political careers often 
            took him away from his growing family, Kitty and the children were 
            frequent guests at the Patroon's and at the Schuyler estate at <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">the 
            Flats</a>. She also formed a special relationship with Colonel <a href="../b/jobradstreet.html">John 
            Bradstreet</a>, her husband's mentor and their houseguest. Twenty 
            years her senior, their friendship has been the subject of contemporary 
            and historical speculation. Kitty's son was named <a href="../s/jobrschuyler.html">John 
            Bradstreet Schuyler</a> and both mother and son were left substantial 
            bequests following Colonel Bradstreet's death in 1774.</p>

<p><img src="../../images/jpg/na/mrsschuyler.jpg" align=left width=300 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="Mrs. Schuyler firing her fields in 1777">Reaching her fortieth birthday in 1774, Kitty gave birth to three more children before 1781. Despite the stress occasioned by the War for Independence, the Schuylers spent time at both their Albany and Saratoga estates. While General Schuyler was engaged in repelling the British invasions in 1776 and 1777, his wife focused on the ongoing management of two households. The tradition of Catherine herself setting fire to their fields at Schuylerville to prevent them from being utilized by the advancing British under General John Burgoyne has been <a href="http://www.teachushistory.org/node/265#'1161966160222286628">memorialized</a> in a painting by Emanuel Leuzte (done in 1852) and reproduced widely as an engraving.

 <p>After the marriage of John Bradstreet Schuyler in 1787 and his re-location to Schuylerville, his parents fell back on their elegant Albany home where they <a href="../../census1790.html#1750">resided</a> for the remainder of their lives.</p>
  
<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#1750">1800</a>, their Albany household still included four children and eleven slaves. Catharine Van Rensselaer Schuyler died in March 1803 at age sixty-nine. Philip Schuyler died in 1804.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of Catherine <a href="vr.html">Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 5070. This summary 
            profile is derived chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. 
            Her life is further embellished in a biographical work published in 
            a series on "Women of Colonial and Revolutionary Times:" Mary Gay 
            Humphreys, <i>Catherine Schuyler</i> (New York, 1897). This romanticized 
            work was reprinted in 1968 and is basic to further development of 
            Kitty Schuyler's story.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although based on substantial existing genealogical resources for this most prominent New Netherland family, the <a href="http://otal.umd.edu/~walt/gen/htmfile/962.htm">online genealogical pages</a> of Walter Gilbert have been valuable in articulating our work on the Albany Van Rensselaers. Chief among the printed works on the family is Florence Van Rensselaer, <i>The Van Rensselaers in Holland and in America</i> (New York, 1956).<br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name=description></a>Comments on her <b> 
            appearance and character</b> are drawn largely from Don Gerlach's 
            <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html#biography">two biographies</a> of 
            her husband. </p>


<p><a name=portrait></a>Detail from a <b>portrait</b> of Catherine Schuyler attributed to <a href="../zart/thmcil.html">Thomas McIlworth</a> (c. 1760s). Copy show here appears in Mary Gay Humphreys, <i>Catherine Schuyler</i>. Original in the collection of the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/">New-York Historical Society</a>.</p>
