<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the <a href="#sources"><strong>Van Rensselaer</strong></a> name immediately comes to mind when considering the settlement and development of the greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany</a> region. Clearly the most well-known and recognizable <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>-era family <a href="../../nnfamilies.html">name</a>, at the same time, comparatively <a href="kvr.html">few</a> Van Rensselaers actually meet the <a href="../../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion in our study of the people who founded and built the <a href="../../earlycity.html">city</a> of Albany. 

<p>Though small in <a href="../bioindex.html#vr">number</a> (probably fewer than fifty adults with the majority being Van Rensselaer <a href="#women">women</a> who married into mainline Albany families) , the city Van Rensselaers were <a href="#prominent">un</a>commonly prominent in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based record</a>. At the same time, any attempt to tell their story only through the lives of the city resident family members would be a serious under-representation of the Van Rensselaer contribution to the development of the early city.

<p>As the first Europeans to "own" the land that after <a href="../../charter.html">1686</a> surrounded the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> of Albany, the Van Rensselaers were responsible for recruiting and sponsoring likely emigres who would develop and safeguard their vast estate. Virtually all of the families who became Albany residents could trace their American origins to some contact with the Van Rensslear family.

<p>From the time of the Reverend <a href="nvr.html">Nicholas Van Rensselaer</a> until the mid-eighteenth century, the Van Rensselaer family home at the <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm Tree Corner</a> was inhabited by the descendants of his <a href="../s/alschuyler95.html">widow</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census.html#1697">1697</a>, the first comprehensive census of the city of Albany described only the <a href="../../census1697.html#094">home</a> of <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a> within the city stockade. At that time, the only Van Rensselaer household configured on the census of the manor was that of his slightly older  brother - the yet-unmarried <a href="../../census1697.html#rw">patroon</a>.

<p>A famous yet mysterious <a href="boy.html">portrait</a> from the first half of the eighteenth century reminds us that the Van Rensselaers also were the largest slaveholders in the region. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, the census of Albany householders taken by the British army showed on the house of "<a href="../g/elgroesbeck3292.html">Mrs. Ranslow</a>" among the  city households.

<p>City resident Van Rensselaer men included:</p>

<dd><a href="nvr.html">Nicholas Van Rensselaer</a> - son of the first Patroon and an <a href="../../stpeters.html">A</a>nglican minister. 
<dd><a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a> - Albany alderman and later represented the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>
<dd><a href="jevr5085.html">Jeremiah Van Rensselaer</a> - congressman and lieutenant governor of New York State
<dd><a href="pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a> - merchant and developer of Cherry Hill
<dd><a href="psvr5106.html">Philip S. Van Rensselaer</a> - mayor of Albany in 1798.
<dd><a href="kvr5092.html">Kiliaen K. Van Rensselaer</a> - attorney, congressman, and councilman

<p>Even though these individuals maintained prominent city homes, the Van Rensselaer family headquarters was the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> - located along the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">river road</a> in what became <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> - about a half mile north of the city <a href="../../citylimits.html">line</a>. An additional family country seat was located across the Hudson in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html#greenbush">Greenbush</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, two Van Rensselaer-named houses were listed on the census for the city of Albany and two more in adjoining <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>. However, those four mansions housed a total of twenty-eight slaves and each each of them was valued at the top of their particular assessment rolls. 

<p><a href="svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer III</a> (the "last" patroon) was the most notable American-born family member.  With assets at the time of his death estimated at ten million dollars, in 2007 <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0702/gallery.richestamericans.fortune/index.html"><i>Fortune</i> Magazine</a> named him the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/fortune/0702/gallery.richestamericans.fortune/10.html">tenth richest</a> American of all time. However, he assumed the title "Lord of the Manor" on his twenty-first birthday and never really lived in the city - although he held buildings and properties in Albany and beyond. His contemporary and aide, <a href="solvr5113.html">Solomon Van Rensselaer</a>, was a more representative early Albany family member.</p>

<p>The Van Rensselaer family played a major part in the settlement and development of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, 
<a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a>, <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>!</p>
