<strong>Maria Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was born in March 1689. She was the first child born to Albany leader <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a> and his wife, the well-born Manhattanite <a href="../vb/cavbrugh8627.html">Catharina Van Brugh</a>. Maria grew up, the eldest in a large family, in her father's Albany home and on his country estate across the river in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html#greenbush">Greenbush</a>.

<p>In November 1712, she married <a href="../t/satbroeck79.html">Samuel Ten Broeck</a>, the son of another landed and wealthy early Albany family. By 1730, the marriage had produced eight children, most of whom were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>  where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Ten Broecks soon settled on family lands in southeastern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> where they were prominent residents for several decades.
 
<p>Maria Van Rensselaer Ten Broeck lost her husband in 1756. She died in July 1771 at the age of seventy-four. She was buried with the Van Rensselaers in Greenbush.</p>
