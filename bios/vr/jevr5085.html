      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Jeremiah Van Rensselaer</b></a> was born in August 
        1738. He was the son of <a href="jovr5127.html">John</a> and <a href="../l/enlivingston5014.html">Engeltie 
        Livingston</a> Van Rensselaer. Losing his mother before his tenth birthday, 
        the boy grew up at Crailo and at his father's city house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> of Albany.</p>

        was educated by tutors and then sent to Nassau Hall at the College of 
        New Jersey (<a href="http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;sid=5901e504abd9875171b06cc4f36021f4;q1=princeton;cite1restrict=title;cite2restrict=title;cite3restrict=title;rgn=title;firstpubl1=1800;firstpubl2=1925;idno=AGE3744.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000001">Princeton</a>) 
        where he graduated in 1758. After some time in New York, he returned to 
        Albany to settle down and raise a family.</p>
      <p>In 1760, he married <a href="../b/jubayard.html">Judith Bayard</a>, daughter 
        of a notable New York business family. Their son was born in December 
        1762. Following her death, he wed <a href="../l/helansing3339.html">Helena 
        Lansing</a> in February 1764. His marriages produced two surviving sons 
        - one of whom became a <a href="solvr5113.html">Congressman</a>. Jeremiah 
        Van Rensselaer was a member, pewholder, and frequent baptism sponsor at 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - where a number 
        of children were named for him!</p>
      <p>In 1764, his name was included on a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html">list</a> 
        of Albany merchants. He engaged in some importing to supply the Indian 
        trade. In 1771, he was a land agent advertizing in the newly formed <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany 
        Gazette</i></a>. He also was known as a surveyor.</p>
      <p>He lived in the Van Rensselaer family <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5085">house</a> 
        on the East side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        and owned other lots in the city as well. In 1774, he became proprietor 
        of the so-called "Van Rensselaer Patent" of more than 28,000 acres in 
        what is today Fulton County.</p>
      <p>He was first elected to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> 
        as assistant alderman for the second ward in 1770. He was re-elected each 
        year until the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> caused the Albany 
        corporation to suspend its operations. He was active in committee work 
        and was re-imbursed frequently for expenses.</p>
      <p><a name=sig></a>Jeremiah Van Rensselaer was an early supporter of the 
        crusade for American liberties. In 1766, he was a leading signatory of 
        the <a href="../../solconst.html#ty">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons 
        of Liberty. Known beyond Albany as a patriot leader, he represented the 
        second ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>, 
        then served on the Albany County Board of the Commissioners for Detecting 
        and Defeating Conspiracies, and later was approinted to the Commissioners 
        of Forfeitures for New York State. 
      <p>At the outbreak of hostilities, Jeremiah Van Rensselaer was in his late 
        thirties and was commissioned an ensign in the third regiment of the New 
        York Line. He served in the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">Revolutionary 
        army</a> - mostly as paymaster.</p>
      <p>During the late 1780s, he emerged as a leader of Albany's opposition 
        to the proposed Federal Constitution - perhaps being the only Antifederalist 
        member of the Van Rensselaer family! He corresponded with Republican notables 
        including <a href="http://www.virtualology.com/thomas-jefferson.net/">Thomas 
        Jefferson</a>.</p>
      <p>Served in the first Federal Congress 1789-91. In <a href="../../census1790.html#5085">1790</a> 
        and in <a href="../../census1800.html#5085">1800</a>, his home was an 
        Albany landmark that was attended by three slaves. </p>
      <p>Since early adulthood, he was a prominent member and officer of the Albany 
        <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic Lodge</a>. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="more to come!"></a></p>
      <p>Educated and respected, Van Rensselaer was named executor of a number of substantial 
        estates including that of the Lutheran evangelical pietist <a href="../h/jochartwick.html">John C. Hartwick</a>.</p>
      <p>In September 1791, he was among those who toured New York State with 
        <a href="../w/elkwatson.html">Elkanah Watson</a> to study inland navigation. 
        A published journal describes those travels.</p>
      <p>One of the first directors of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank 
        of Albany</a> in 1792 and later president of the bank. In 1795, he was 
        appointed one of the commissioners for building a state hall in Albany. 
        In 1796, he was a partner in a window factory in Hamilton, New York. He 
        belonged to a number of civic organizations including the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany 
        Mechanics Society</a>.</p>
      <p>He was chosen Lieutenant Governor of New York State in 1801 and served 
        during Governor George Clinton's last term ending in 1804.</p>
      <p>Jeremiah Van Rensselaer filed a <a href="../../wills/willjevr5085.html">will</a> 
        in 1807. He died in February 1810. His will passed probate a month later.</p>
