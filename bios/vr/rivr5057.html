<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Richard Van Rensselaer</strong></a> was born in June 1639. He was the fifth son of patriarch <a href="kvr.html">Kiliaen Van Rensselaer</a> and the fourth born to his second wife, Anna Wely Van Rensselaer. His famous father died within a few years of his birth. However, this youngest boy's immediate <a href="http://www.science24.org/show/Kiliaen_van_Rensselaer_(Dutch_merchant)">family</a> was large and supportive. 

<p>He is said to have come to New Netherland in 1651 (or <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qo808tARY-EC&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=%22richard+van+rensselaer%22&source=bl&ots=h8ejOBurEo&sig=FHS-f3qIl8ud8MbZJqFt7-gUrCc&hl=en&ei=eBbLS5bXL4i89QSwrMzXBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22richard%20van%20rensselaer%22&f=false">perhaps</a> in 1664) with his brother Jan Baptiste and to have served as a magistrate in <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/historical/southernnewyork/s_ny_43.htm">Rensselaerswyck</a> for a number of years. 


<p>In October 1664, he was among those who took the <a href="../../nat.html">oath</a> of allegience to the English Duke of York.

<p>He is <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/topic/historical/southernnewyork/s_ny_43.htm">said</a> to have "owned" the farm at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flats</a> that was sold to the <a href="../s/schuyler.html">Schuyler family</a> in 1670 or 1672.

<p>He is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~clifflamere/History/Albany-History.htm">said</a> to have been an adept businessman and to have attempted to organize the family holdings in the Hudson Valley. Much of his connection to the history of the city of Albany relates to that initiative and particularly to his correspondences with the <a href="../vc/mvc.html">widow</a> of his brother <a href="jevr.html">Jeremias Van Rensselaer</a>. However, Richard (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Ryckert) returned to Europe during the 1670s (perhaps as early as in 1670) to look after his own affairs.

<p>In August 1681, he <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=nschroed&id=I04569">married</a> Anna Van Beaumont in Amsterdam. All of their seven or more children were born in Europe.

<p>He served as a town official (burgomaster among others) in the Netherlands.
