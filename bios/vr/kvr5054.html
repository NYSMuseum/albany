<P><a href="#sources"><b>Kiliaen Van Rensselaer</b></a> was born in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in August 1663. He was the first son of Patroon Jeremias and <a href="../vc/mvc.html">Maria Van Cortlandt</a> Van Rensselaer. His father died in 1674 and eleven-year-old Kiliaen was the first name to appear on the list of those <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#5054">invited</a> to the Patroon's funeral. He assumed the title of Lord of the Manor on his twenty-first birthday.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#5054">1697</a>, his name alone in his house headed the Manor census.

<p>In 1701, he married <a href="../vc/mavc.html">Maria Van Cortlandt</a> at the New York Dutch church. By 1717, their ten children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors. He was a pillar of his church as well as a supporter of newly established <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. </p>

<p>Although he owned "the Patroon's House" in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> of Albany, his residence was at the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> built by his father and located north of the city. He served the Albany community as assessor, justice, and supervisor. He also sat with the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. In 1704, he was appointed to the Governor's Council of advisors and served for the rest of his life. Previously, he had been a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html"> militia</a> officer and had represented Rensselaerswyck in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> from 1693 to 1704.</p>

<p>In 1704, he partitioned the Manor into two parts - according the Claverack or "Lower Manor" to his younger brother, <a href="hvr5053.html">Hendrick</a>. During his time, he signed up many tenants and also sold <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lands</a> in different parts of his estate.</p> 

<p>Kiliaen Van Rensselaer filed a <a href="../../wills/willkvr5054.html">will</a> in June 1718. It detailed his extensive holdings! He died in New York City on September 16, 1719. He had lived fifty-six years. In 1728, his somewhat younger widow married the newly arrived Reverend <a href="../m/jomilne.html">John Milne</a>. His sons, the heirless Jeremias and <a href="stvr.html">Stephen</a>, followed him as lords of the manor.</p>
