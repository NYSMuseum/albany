<p><font size=-1><blockquote>The initial settler population of the community that became the <a href="../earlycity.html">city of Albany</a> in 1686 came to America before 1664. These pioneers are known today as the <a href="../nnd.html">New Netherland Dutch</a>. More than half of them were natives of Holland. But that is not the complete story. Also included in that group were Catholic and Protestant French, Germans, Scandinavians, Scots, Irish, and a smaller number of representatives of most European cultures not to mention a visible but unknown number of those whose origins were <a href="../afroalbanians.html">African</a>.
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<b>T</b>his section considers the early residents of Albany who were known widely as "The Irish."</blockquote>.</font size>
<br>
<p>Hibernians or <a href="../org/standsoc.html">St. Andrews Society</a>? Historically speaking, who were the early Albany Irish? And who were the early Albany Scots? 

          <p>Hundreds of people who meet the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> 
            <a href="../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion as city people 
            ultimately found their roots to be in what is now Scotland, Ireland, 
            or Northern Ireland (Ulster). Understanding them culturally first 
            raises questions of terminology. 
          <P>One of the more puzzling terms for this historian is the frequently encountered reference to "<b>the Irish</b>" who came to the American colonies and particularly to those who <a href="../res/visitors.html">visited</a> and settled in early Albany. Like so many of the traditional words used to describe the people of colonial Albany, the term "Irish" means different things to different people. Those who said "Irish" regarding eighteenth-century Albany knew who they were talking about. Today, we certainly are less certain!

<p>For consistency and because they are more or less exclusionary, we hold that Irish referred to a <a href="../org/stmarys.html">Roman Catholic</a>. Scots mostly were <a href="../presbyterian.html">Presbyterians</a>.

<p>The Colonial Albany Project approach to the so-called "Irish" is simple and direct. We seek to <a href="../res/origins.html">identify</a> (maybe "verify" is better) the ancestral homelands of every person who lived in the city of Albany prior to the Industrial Revolution. More definitive statements about those minority groups might follow completion of a comprehensive census of all such resident individuals.

          <p> The <a href="../garrison.html">garrison</a> soldiers who arrived 
            after 1664 were more clearly from Catholic rather than Calvinist homes 
            and more fittingly (to our mind) were called Irish. We have noticed 
            that the Catholics were less willing to seek services in the most 
            dominant and consistent <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Reformed church</a> 
            than the Scottish Presbyterians who were more comfortable with the 
            Reformed liturgy despite the language barrier. 
          <p>Over the first half of the eighteenth century and particularly during the years <a href="../peace.html">1713-44</a>, newcomers of both backgrounds settled in the Albany community - although they mostly went on to so-called "greener pastures" in the more outlying parts of huge <a href="../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.

<p>The problem of differentiating early Albany's Scots from its Irish seems to have been more widespread during the eighteenth century and particularly after 1750. In <a href="../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> days, the Scots &eacute;migr&eacute; - principally the <a href="g/glen.html">Glen</a> and <a href="s/sanders.html">Sanders</a> families were known as Scots. By the 1670s, they were joined by Scottish minister's son <a href="l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a> - perhaps the most important man to live in colonial Albany.
		  
<p>Following the end of the <a href="../7yw.html">Great War for Empire</a>, British-connected <a href="../res/realestate.html">land</a> speculators and developers sought to entice new settlers with <a href="#1772">advertisements</a> like this one from 1772 <a href="http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/Scotch-Irish/2002-05/1020638624">found</a> in the collections of the Library of Congress.
<p>Chief among the clans that established roots in Albany and its hinterland were the <a href="c/campbell.html">Campbells</a>:

<p><center><a href="../inprog.html"><img src="../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=30 height=28 border=1 alt="information page in-progress"></a></center>

<p>Scots, Scots-Irish, and Irish Catholics were even more prominent in post-Revolutionary War Albany. I find it interesting (or at least curious) that twelve property owners were named Alexander ___ according to the citywide assessment roll for <a href="../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>.

          <p>Understanding the lives of Catholics and Presbyterians (and their less godfearing 
            countrymen) in their Albany context is a longtime particular interest 
            (not that I can't say that about every other group). My larger <a href="../welcome.html">ambition</a> 
            precludes focusing on them exclusively. This exposition will make 
            more sense in the future. Please bear with us!</p>

          <blockquote>TO ALL FARMERS AND TRADESMEN, Who want good Settlements 
            for themselves and Families, especially those lately arrived, or that 
            may yet come, from Scotland or Ireland. 
            <p>THE Province of New-York is the most healthy Climate in America. 
              Many Persons in it live to 80 or 90 Years of Age; and many sickly 
              People from the Carolinas, &c. come to it for the Recovery of their 
              Health. Few in it are troubled with Fever or Ague, which prevails 
              so much in the Southern Colonies. It is neither so sultry hot as 
              Maryland, Virginia or the Carolinas, nor so very cold as in St. 
              Johns, Halifax, &c. In several Winters the Snow lies but about 15 
              Inches deep for 9 Weeks steadfastly without Rain: Thus their Wheat 
              is well guarded from being froze out of Ground, and the constant 
              Snow affords an easy Carriage of Grain to the <a href="../loc/markethouse.html">Market</a> 
              at the <a href="../im/im1770.html">City of Albany</a>, and for fetching 
              home Salt, Iron, &c. from it. In the Counties of Albany, Tryon, 
              Charlotte, Cumberland and Gloucester of said Province thousands 
              of Farms are to be sold for 6 Shillings Sterling per Acre, and 6 
              Years given to pay the Money, or rented at Sixpence Sterling per 
              Acre, and a Lease for ever. The first 5 Years rent-free, only 2s. 
              6d. Sterling Quit-Rent, either in buying or renting the Land. If 
              it is desired by a Number of Families, ten thousand Acres or more 
              can be had in one Spot. The little Hills all over the Country are 
              a Shelter from the cold North-West Winds. The Water is plenty, and 
              as good as any in the World; a fine Spaw-Well is lately found near 
              Cambridge. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp;The Soil is various; in some Parts a brown or grey 
              Loam, in others Gravel and some Sand, in others a black Mould. It 
              produceth Oats, Wheat, Flax, Hemp, Hay, Barley, and the best Potatoes 
              in America, without Manure. The Wood is Ash, Elm, Oak, Beech, and 
              white and yellow Pine-Trees, which last bring some 1000 Pounds to 
              the Settlers. Some hundreds of said Farms can be got in Cambridge 
              and other Parts, within 30, 20, 10 or 5 Miles of New-Perth Church 
              and Mills, 36 Miles North-East of Albany, where Dr. Clark began 
              a Settlement 1766, which consists now of about 130 Families, many 
              of whom at their first Arrival had 4 or 5 Children, and were not 
              worth Ten Shillings, and are now worth Hundred Pounds free and real 
              Estate. They got above 3000 lb. Sugar out of their Trees this Spring. 
              They will show the Lands to Strangers, and they usually lodge a 
              Stranger free, till he gets a House erected on his own Farm, which 
              they usually help him to build in one Day. Some Cattle and also 
              Grain will be sold to Strangers, on a Year's Credit, at the Mills 
              of Perth and Cambridge. Passengers from Scotland or Ireland had 
              best go on board of Ships bound for New-York; but such as arrive 
              in Philadelphia, may ask at the Crooked Billet Wharf; and there 
              every Wednesday Morning they will get a Passage in Boats and Waggons 
              90 Miles to New-York for 4s. 8d. Sterling each, in a Days and an 
              half, or less. <br>
              &nbsp; &nbsp; Arriving at New-York, ask for the Honourable William 
              Smith, Esq; <a href="../bios/b/gbanyar7200.html">Goldsborow Banyar</a>, 
              Thomas Smith, Esquires, and Mr. Kelly, Attorney at Law in the Street 
              called Broadway, who will shew any Man the Maps of said Lands, and 
              agree as to the Price, which if the Stranger likes, upon viewing 
              the Land, he can instantly go to work upon it. The Passage to Albany 
              is about 2s. 6d. or 3 s. Sterling; and arriving there, ask for Mr. 
              <a href="../bios/w/edwillett.html">Edward Willet</a>, Schoolmaster, 
              who gives good private Lodgings, and will shew the Road to said 
              Lands.
