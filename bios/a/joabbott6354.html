      <P>Well-known in Albany as <a href="#sources"><b>John James Abbott</b></a>, this 
        individual was born about 1726. <a href="../../nat.html">Naturalized</a> 
        in 1765, he appears to have been of <a href="../ger.html">Ger</a>manic <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>. 
        His name has been encountered under a number of <a href="../../res/sp.html">spellings</a>. 
        However, we seek more specific information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">background</a> and path 
        to Albany.</p>


<p>In 1762, he received a provincial license to marry <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Mary Catherine Loman (aka <a href="../../res/sp.html">S</a>aunse) - beginning an Albany union that would last for more than forty years. Only their son was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1767. However, his family seems to have been much larger.

      <p> In 1766, he was among those granted a lot on which to erect a <a href="../../drc.html#grc">German 
        Reformed church</a>. These Albany men were a core of the emerging German-speaking 
        enclave and mostly were identified as living near the waterfront. In 1774, 
        he was one of those <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bFBKAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA7-PA25&lpg=RA7-PA25&dq=%22john+james+abbott%22+albany&source=bl&ots=4KHvAopP2C&sig=VkEJXhy49SI3dWg1sjiT5seQ-rU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwib_Y-SgcnPAhVFHD4KHdiYDUYQ6AEILDAD#v=onepage&q=%22john%20james%20abbott%22&f=false">petitioning</a> 
        the provincial government for reimbursement for building the "German church" 
        in Albany.</p>

<p>By the mid-<a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, he was an Albany householder - apparently living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He seems to have practiced the watchmaker's <a href="../../makers.html">trade</a>. In 1771, he was paid by the Albany government for repairing the "city clock." By mid-decade, he had been given the contract to care for the clock. He was one of the first watchmakers to live in colonial Albany.</p>

In 1772, he had been granted a lot along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6354">1779</a>, his (Ebbet) house in the first ward (probably near the waterfront) was valued moderately while his more liquid assets were assessed at a rate comparable to that accorded the more recently arrived. At the same time, his lot (probably along Foxes Creek) was <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#joab">assessed</a> modestly. 

<p>Abbott supported the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties and was among those who signed the <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">General Association</a> in 1776. Afterwards, he was granted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">bounty right</a> as a member of the First Regiment of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany County Militia</a>. Too old for active service, he was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">exempted</a> in 1778. He contributed to the war effort and continued to care for the city clock.</p>
 

<p>Certainly by 1790, he had set up his home and shop in the <a href="../../census1790.html#6354">waterfront area</a> of the first ward. He later lived on Maiden Lane, Dock Street, Market Street.  In <a href="../../census1800.html#6354">1800</a>, his third ward household included nine people.</p>


<p>John James Abbott lost his wife in August 1809. He <a href="../../dead.html">died</a> in July 1810 and was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=127648456">buried</a> in the Episcopal plot. Later, his <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=127648456">stone</a> was relocated to Albany Rural Cemetery. "Albany's first watchmaker" had lived eighty-four years.</p>

<B>Sources:</B> The life of John James Abbott/Ebbett is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6354. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based         resources</a>. He may have been the "Gams Abbet" listed on the roster of John Winne's militia company in 1767 which included a number of German émigrés to Albany. He should not be confused with his contemporary John Abbott of Halfmoon and/or Hoosick!</font size></p>
