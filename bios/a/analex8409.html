      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ann Alexander</strong></a> probably was 
        born about 1760. She is said to have emigrated from Scotland. 
      <p>By December 1785, she had found her way to Albany where she married newcomer 
        <a href="../h/wmhenry8429.html">William Henry</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. By 1798, the marriage had produced at least four children 
        including the future scientist <a href="../h/joshenry.html">Joseph Henry</a> 
        who was born in Albany at the end of 1797. 
      <p>These Henrys settled into a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8429">modest 
        home</a> on what became <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#bottom">South 
        Pearl Street</a> from where, by that time, William (a day laborer) was 
        only able to provide a marginal existence for his young family. Their 
        marriage was not a long one as William Henry died in 1811 - shy of his 
        forty-eighth birthday. Even before then, young Joseph was sent to live 
        with his grandparents in rural Saratoga County. 
      <p>Beginning with the first issue in 1813, "Widow Ann Henry" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA70,M1">listed</a> 
        in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as the head 
        of the household residing on what became 75 South Pearl Street. By 1827, 
        she had moved in above the <a href="../../loc/publicsq.html">public square</a> 
        with her son on the grounds of the first Albany Academy where Joseph Henry 
        was a faculty member. 
      <p>She was a devoted member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
        church. 
      <p>Joseph Henry's cousin and brother-in-law (probably Ann's kinsman), <a href="http://74.125.93.104/search?q=cache:M3AOiKhVv4AJ:books.nap.edu/html/biomems/salexander.pdf+%22stephen+alexander%22+schenectady&cd=6&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">Stephen 
        Alexander</a>, is said to have been a noted astronomer and academician 
        - quite a contrast from the working class Henrys. 
      <p>A number of contemporaries noted her exceptional <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=97UaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22joseph+henry%22#PPA4,M1">character</a>. 
        A miniature of her was <a href="http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=V238U1P838082.2187&profile=ariall&uri=link=3100012~!324021~!3100001~!3100002&aspect=Browse&menu=search&ri=2&source=~!siartinventories&term=Portrait+female+--+Henry%2C+William%2C+Mrs.+%28Ann+Alexander%29&index=#focus">painted</a> 
        by <a href="ea.html">Ezra Ames</a>. 
      <p>Ann Alexander Henry died in April 1835 at the age of seventy-five.</p>
