<P>The first Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Tilly Allen</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Tilley) perhaps was born in <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/NYALBANY/2002-10/1035520730">1788</a> or '89. If so, he may have been the <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Tilly-Allen/6000000006568619878">son</a> of Abner and Lucy Brooks Allen of Sturbridge, Massachusetts. Probably of <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> background, we seek more definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, the existence of same-named contemporaries dictates <a href="#caution">caution</a> in the assignment of qualitative information.

<p>Allen <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/albany_ny_1st_presby.htm">joined</a> the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church in Albany in March 1812. The church record noted that he was a transfer from a "sister church." Perhaps, this individual was <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/NYALBANY/2002-10/1035520730">married</a> twice. In August 1813, Tilly <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&db=matownvital&new=1&gsfn=tilly&gsln=allen&rank=1&gss=angs-d&mswpn__ftp=Albany%2c+Albany%2c+New+York%2c+USA&mswpn=10034&mswpn_PInfo=8-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3244%7c35%7c0%7c128%7c10034%7c0%7c&msbdy=1788&sbo=1&pcat=34&fh=4&h=80032592&recoff=6+7&ml_rpos=5">wed</a> Mary <a href="../../res/sp.html">Cu</a>tler in Brookfield, Massachusetts. At that time, he was identified as a resident of Albany. The marriage was short-lived as she was buried from the Second <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church of Albany in September 1816. She had lived but twenty-six years. In June 1819, Tilly Allen married Mary Hazard at the Albany Presbyterian church. She <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA262&lpg=PA262&dq=%22tilly+allen%22+albany&source=bl&ots=GuPe2n2DIG&sig=nBbu5dRLAb7Eu_tVBaLxQ9-hrFs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=m3_JUtDYCMj4oATbuIDQCQ&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22tilly%20allen%22%20albany&f=false">died</a> and was <a href="http://newyorkgravestones.org/view.php?id=66464">buried</a> from the church in January 1833. 

<p>In <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22allen+tilley%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22allen%20tilley%22&f=false"">1813</a>, the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> listed him as a merchant living at 10 State Street. Subsequent directories noted 10 North Pearl and then 36 Columbia Streets as second addresses.

      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, the <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/7734/4433435_00119/561564?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3findiv%3d1%26db%3d1820usfedcenancestry%26rank%3d1%26new%3d1%26MSAV%3d1%26msT%3d1%26gss%3dangs-d%26gsfn%3dtilly%26gsln%3dallen%26gsln_x%3dNS_NP%26msbdy%3d1788%26msrpn__ftp%3dAlbany%252c%2bAlbany%252c%2bNew%2bYork%252c%2bUSA%26msrpn%3d10034%26msrpn_PInfo%3d8-%257c0%257c1652393%257c0%257c2%257c3244%257c35%257c0%257c128%257c10034%257c0%257c%26gskw%3d1820%26cpxt%3d0%26catBucket%3drst%26uidh%3d9w2%26msbdp%3d10%26cp%3d0%26pcat%3dCEN_1820%26fh%3d1%26h%3d561564%26recoff%3d8%2b9%26ml_rpos%3d2&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnRecord">census</a> 
        counted five members and a slave in his Albany household. At that time, 
        another Tilly Allen was head of a household in Salem, Washington County. 
        In <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?indiv=1&db=1830usfedcenancestry&rank=1&new=1&MSAV=1&msT=1&gss=angs-d&gsfn=tilly&gsln=allen&gsln_x=NS_NP&msbdy=1788&msydy=1830&msypn__ftp=Albany%2c+Albany%2c+New+York%2c+USA&msypn=10034&msypn_PInfo=8-%7c0%7c1652393%7c0%7c2%7c3244%7c35%7c0%7c128%7c10034%7c0%7c&cpxt=0&catBucket=rst&uidh=9w2&msbdp=10&cp=0&pcat=CEN_1830&fh=0&h=2129917&recoff=10+11&ml_rpos=1">1830</a>, 
        his household in the second ward in Albany consisted of seven members. 
      <p>In 1819, he was elected a director of the "Albany Sunday School Society." In October 1829, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NpEUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA361&lpg=PA361&dq=%22tilly+allen%22&source=bl&ots=HAd56XrwjP&sig=4tqkehWkx9EVQbENT6hlXuXY5sI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2P3HUuPFJJLzoATy-ICIBA&ved=0CFMQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22tilly%20allen%22&f=false">named</a> in the minutes with other "honorary members" at the twelfth annual meeting of the "American Board of Foreign Missions" held at the First Presbyterian Church in Albany.

      <p>In 1830, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>, identified 
        him as a merchant with a residence on the corner of Columbia and North 
        Pearl Streets. His store and the partnership of "Allen & Hazard" was located 
        at 52 and 53 State Street (corner of Green). 
      <p>Businessman, director, and investor, his enterprises were numerous and varied while in Albany and afterwards. During the 1830s, he seems to have moved on to Rochester, New York, and then Brooklyn. We have not pursued the <a href="../../na/na.html">out</a>-of-Albany elements of his life.
    
<p>According to the <i>New York Times</i>, seventy-five-year-old Tilly Allen <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1862/08/19/news/died.html">died</a>, of heart disease at his residence in Brooklyn in August 1862. His remains were removed for  <a href="http://billiongraves.com/pages/record/TillyAllen/1208933">burial</a> to the cemetery in Waterford, New York.</p>

<p><a name=caution></a>We have generally assigned Albany, community-based information to this individual but we understand that the life of a younger Tilly Allen might be at play here. At this point, we have not definitively connected him to the other early Albany <a href="soallen.html">Allens</a>. We will keep surfing and probing.

<p><b>Portrait</b>: The <a href="../../books.html#eaa">chroniclers</a> of the work of Albany artist <a href="ea.html">Ezra Ames</a> have only noted the charges for portraits of "Mr. Tilly Allen" and "his lady" in July 1824.
