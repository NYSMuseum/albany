<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"><strong>Elizabeth Abeel</strong></a> was born in March 1671. She was the daughter of Albany carpenter <a href="chabeel112.html">Stoffel Janse</a> and his wife <a href="../c/cocroon.html">Neeltie Croon</a> Abeel. Although she was named and identified as a seven-year-old in the <a href="../../wills/willabeel.html">joint will</a> filed by her parents in 1678, she soon was orphaned as both parents died during the early 1680s.


<p>She was but fifteen when she married twenty-one-year-old fur trader <a href="../b/ebancker6454.html">Evert Bancker</a> in September 1686. By 1710, thirteen children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a long time member and frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>These Banckers prospered and lived in a prominent townhouse on lower <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> and also maintained a house in Manhattan where Evert enjoyed the "freedom of the city." They had a farm west of Albany and also spent time on the frontier at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. Evert Bancker was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany first in 1694.

<p>During the <a href="../../peace.html">period of peace</a>, Evert and Elizabeth's family gravitated more to their Guilderland farm.

<p>Elizabeth Abeel Bancker died in March 1734 and was buried from the Albany church. Bancker filed a will and then died a few months later.
