      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Adams</strong></a> was born about 
        1730. We seek information on his origins. It does not apppear he was a 
        close relative of the prominent Schenectady-based <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/adames/messages/42.html">Adams</a> 
        family. 
      <p>In November 1752, he married Margarita Hageman (<a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>egman) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. At that time, the partners were said to have been of "Na" 
        (New Albany). By the early 1760s, the marriage had produced four children. 
        He also received some services at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> 
        Anglican church. 
		
<p>In 1756, his modest Albany house was described on a <a href="../../census1756.html#175">census</a> taken by the British army. He was called "Chevy Adams" and was identified as a "carter." It appears that his home was located on or near the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany.
		
<p>He may have been a "partner" in a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IkXQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA541&lpg=PA541&dq=%22james+adams%22+albany&source=bl&ots=GkAfjTHOp6&sig=k-ROuT0N12O4gVb3pmLdrtcSeCM&hl=en&ei=LXdLSvqKH9H6tgfgqNibDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10">venture</a> 
        to acquire what probably was wilderness <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land 
        </a> along with a number of Albany and Albany area people. However, he 
        was not named among the patentees when the title was confirmed in 1769.
		
<p>James Adams filed a <a href="../../wills/willjaadams7092.html">will</a> in August 1762. It named his wife and three children as his heirs. He was buried from the Dutch church in October. In 1766 and '67, his widow's home was <a href="../../sources.html#uny">valued</a> on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West Manor</a> assessment roll (probably in the land south of the city limits). One notation referred to the deceased as "the barman." </p>
