<P><a href="#pfs">Known</a> in the <a href="../../nnd.html">Dutch</a> language local <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">court</a> records as "<i>de Iersman Van Dublingh</i>," <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Andriese</strong></a> lived and owned property in what became <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> (chiefly at Catskill and its environs) during the 1640s, 50s, and afterwards.

<p>He 
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ui8LAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&dq=de+IersmanVan+Dublingh&source=bl&ots=IjeLP1P2Zt&sig=D5pvMveukZjXHIivPGOndvbxPek&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QeLHU-jgFrG-sQSbvoGwBA&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=de%20IersmanVan%20Dublingh&f=false">may have been</a> the first person of <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> ancestry to settle in this region.  At the same time, other similarly named individuals (including <a href="jaand7142.html">Jan Andriese de Cuyper</a>) actually were Albany ciry residents. These men were <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> mostly by their patronymic as well and mostly were not of "Anglo" ancestry.

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that he first came to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> - maybe during the 1640s. But prior to <a href="#vrbm">1660</a>, had bought and sold farmland at the "Catskills." The known "facts" of his life have been <a href="https://archive.org/details/earlyirishinolda01dana">chronicled</a> faithfully by the first great <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZfQ7ygI_XlAC&pg=PA241&lpg=PA241&dq=%22franklin+m+danaher%22&source=bl&ots=QAkr-lLdUD&sig=DUzZYpp3eDODxhXeyJ8beF6SSbc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rCbNU5r4AcO-sQSDqoLQCw&ved=0CEsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22franklin%20m%20danaher%22&f=false">historian</a> of the Albany Irish. 

<p>We have not yet uncovered information on a possible wife or family.

<p>This Jan Andriese (aka the Irishman) is said to have died in 1664. His <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=Jan+Andriesz+the+irishman&source=bl&ots=9P5VEZeCXH&sig=yDsRzSh3s0R3unr2R-mO6acl4Wc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HJHKU7nAM9XaoATM3IHYCQ&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Jan%20Andriesz%20the%20irishman&f=false">estate</a> was settled the following year. Thus, he would not be the householder <a href="../../census1679.html#38">appearing</a> on city census taken in <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>.</p>
