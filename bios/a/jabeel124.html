      <P><B>Johannes Abeel</B> was born in Albany in 1667 - the eldest son of 
      builder/trader Stoffel Janse and Neeltje Croon Abeel. Losing his father at 
      age thirteen, the boy became a man bartering for furs with Native hunters 
      - an ambition that took him into the wilderness but also downriver to New 
      York where three of his sisters had married into prominent business 
      families.</P>
          <P>By the mid 1680s, he was administering his father's extensive estate. 
            Young Johannes prospered in the carrying trade to New York while tending 
            to family enterprises in Albany. By the end of the decade, he had 
            settled more in Albany . After the death of his mother, he took over 
            the family home on <A href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</A> 
            - raising a family there following his marriage to <A 
      href="../s/caschuyler1241.html">Catalina Schuyler</A> in 1694.</P>
      <P>By that time, Johannes Abeel already had entered <A 
      href="../../cityfathers.html">public life</A>. He was 
      elected assistant (1688) and then alderman (1691-93 and again in 1700 ) 
      for Albany's <A href="../../wards.html">third 
      ward</A>. In 1694, this prominent merchant was appointed <A 
      href="../../mayors.html">mayor</A> of Albany and 
      served for a year. He would hold the mayor's office again from 1709 to 
      1710. In the meantime, he was elected to represent Albany in the New York 
      General <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> in 1695, 1701, and 1702; was appointed judge of the 
      Albany county court in 1702; one of the masters of the provincial chancery 
      (equity) court in 1705; and also recorder (deputy mayor) of Albany in 
      1702.</P>
      <P>The nature of his personal and public business made Johannes Abeel a 
      citizen of New York City perhaps as much as of his native Albany. A year 
      after serving as Albany's mayor, he sought and received the distinction of 
      a "freeman" of New York City. From Manhattan, he exported skins to London 
      and received consignments of rum, rice, dry goods, and other supplies - 
      some of which were supplied to garrison soldiers in Albany and on the 
      frontier. By 1699, he was back in Albany but in trouble there for trading 
      without the freedom of that city. But a year later, he was elected to the 
      Albany <A href="../../corporation.html">city 
      council</A> and to other offices until his death early in 1711.</P>

<p>However, his overall status qualified him to take part in a number of land patenting initiatives including the <a href="../../na/westen.html">Westenhook Patent</a> (1705).</p>

<P>Like his father, Johannes was a mainstay of the Albany <A href="../../drc.html">Reformed Church</A> - serving as deacon and witnessing more than two dozen Albany baptisms. In 1704, his friend, Dominie <A href="../l/jlydius4614.html">Johannes Lydius</A>, composed a <A 
      href="#anniversary">poem</A> on the occasion of Abeel's 37th birthday. In June 1710, he filed a <a href="../../wills/willjabeel124.html">will</a>. It left everything to his wife and then equally to their children. 


<P>In 1836, workers making improvements North of the Second Dutch Reformed 
      Church on Beaver Street dug up a number of old <A 
      href="../../dead.html">gravestones</A>. According to 
      a newspaper report, one marker read: "Here lies the body of John Abeel who 
      departed this life ye 28 day of Jan'y. 1711, and in the 44 year of his 
      age." However, that relic was thrown out and never found.</P>

      <P>Poem translated from a Dutch language manuscript in the collection of 
      the Long Island Historical Society when it appeared in an article by 
      Kenneth Scott entitled "Johannes Lydius's Birthday Ode to Johannes Abeel,"
