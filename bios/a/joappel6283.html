<strong>Johannes Appel</strong></a> was born during the mid-seventeenth century. He was the son of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> settlers Adriaen Janse and Maria Reyverding Appel. His father was an innkeeper and schoolteacher who moved the family between New York, Albany, and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 

<p>Johannes Appel's wife was named Anna. Perhaps the couple had no children as no baptisms were recorded in Albany. However, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and a frequent baptism sponsor there over several decades as late as January 1727.

<p>During the 1680s, he frequently appeared before the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#court">court</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#2">1689</a>, he was included among Albany householders living in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. At that time, he was identified as  a "master smith" who trained apprentices. He first served as a constable in that year as well.

<p>However, in 1690, he was one of those wounded in the French and Indian attack on Schenectady. He was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany in 1692. In 1693, he also was named <a href="../../corporation.html#marshall">chamberlain</a> or treasurer. He seems to have held both offices at the same time. 

<p>The census taken in <a href="../../census1697.html#130">1697</a>, identified Appel and his wife as Albany residents. Two years later, he joined his Albany neighbors in swearing <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6283">allegiance</a> to the king of England. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his second ward house was valued on the Albany assessment roll. 

<p>After that, he seems to have moved out to the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> where he was listed as a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>. </p>
