<P>The name of <a href="#sources">John Archer</a> appears on a number of <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based</a> documents from the years around 1800. Perhaps he was the kinsman of contemporary Albany residents <a href="edarcher6532.html">Edward</a> and/or <a href="gearcher6534.html">George Archer</a>.

<p>A number of John Archers <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the Revolutionary army. One was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5Fm-DQm1dNUC&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=%22john+archer%22+albany&source=bl&ots=W55w-AlYNH&sig=MyW_6vjTpzPWJD1wK2QyAyPm-_w&hl=en&ei=UFwESpbPLM-wmAfHnNzcBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3">buried</a> in central New York. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6535">1788</a>, his personal property was valued under the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house of <a href="gearcher6534.html">George Archer</a>. In October of that <a href="#source">year</a>, his vote in a second ward election was dis-allowed in Albany as he did not possess the "freedom" of the city.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> were assigned modest assessments. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6535">1800</a>, his household included himself, three boys, two girls and a women aged 26-45.

<p>He probably was among the sons named in the <a href="../../wills/willgearcher.html">will</a> filed by George Archer in 1812. After that, his name has not been found in the community-based  record.

<p>We seek defining demographics and family information on the life of this Albany resident.</p>

The life of John Archer is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6535. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.
<dd>Admittedly, this sketch is pre-mature and is included here to begin to bring forward his story. Perhaps, he had some connection to his seventeenth century namesake, a pioneer of Westchester County.
