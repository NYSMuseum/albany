<P><a href="#sources"><b>Janet Addy</b></a> married <a href="../r/darottery1180.html">David Rottery</a> in September 1760. The marriage produced several children who were raised in their Albany home.</p>

<p>The Rotterys lived above the settled part of the city near the <a href="../../streets.html#lion">road</a> leading from Albany to Schenectady.  In <a href="../../census1790.html#1180">1790</a>, no females were enumerated in Rottery's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household.</p> 


<p>David Rottery's <a href="../../wills/willdarottery.html">will</a>, dated March 1801, called "Jane" his "beloved wife" and named here as principal beneficiary during her lifetime. It also mentioned their living sons, James and Robert.</p>

<p>Her name appeared with his on Albany <a href="../../poor.html">poor lists</a> as early as 1799. In August 1802, David and Janet Rottery were accorded eleven pounds each by the city council. </p>
