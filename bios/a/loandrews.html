      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Loring Andrews</strong></a> was a printer 
        and publisher who was listed as the head of a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> household on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1800.html#loa">1800</a>. 
        He was born about 1767 and no one in that household was born prior to 
        1756. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R7UQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22loring+andrews%22+charleston&source=bl&ots=3mYNSAxTou&sig=pthCwiPvx9jGHvSwucZY78sm8AY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result#PPA96,M1">was</a> 
        the fourth son of farmer Joseph Andrews <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/ANDREWS/2005-11/1131655011">and</a> 
        his wife Hannah Richmond of Hingham, Massachusetts. 
      <p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=19NWMZ6Ec_sC&pg=PA333&lpg=PA333&dq=%22loring+andrews%22+albany&source=web&ots=mQg4L18j8V&sig=DHsMl3Ti9NSa9elR8OiO1Zxeov0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA147,M1">1789</a>, 
        he co-authored an essay entitled "Completion of the Government," which 
        was published in the Boston paper <i>The Herald of Freedom</i>, of which 
        he was a publisher. 
      <p>In 1792, he was a postmaster in <a href="#stock">S</a>tockbridge, Massachusetts 
        and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rBrUERS0B38C&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22loring+andrews%22+albany&source=bl&ots=ZYgSPmLxc8&sig=4hjyXzgp2-19k4s4wmSZckqH47s&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA39,M1">courting</a> 
        Frances, the fourteen-year-old daughter of Theodore Sedgwick. For five 
        years, she was "enraptured" by Andrews. However, her father disapproved 
        and instead arranged for her to be married to Dr.<a href="../p/thpomeroy.html">Thaddeus 
        Pomeroy</a>, a Harvard-educated physician who had opened a drug store 
        in Albany. Perhaps that relationship had some relation to Andrews moving 
        to Albany himself. 
      <p>After settling in Albany, he seems to have been involved in the printing 
        of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=19NWMZ6Ec_sC&pg=PA333&lpg=PA333&dq=%22loring+andrews%22+albany&source=web&ots=mQg2M1bgc-&sig=4nknTtaGZ-NqHjGI21s-BGYKv2o&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result">political 
        tracts</a> - especially in relation to the Federalist party. HIs Albany 
        imprints under the name of "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MKwFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA576&lpg">Loring, 
        Andrews & Company</a>" began to appear in 1798. An example of his commentary 
        appeared in the <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#cent"><i>Albany Centinel</i></a> 
        in December 1798. Perhaps previously, he had been part of "<a href="http://pharos.humboldt.edu:8080/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=1228A6XL98843.423&profile=chu&uri=full=3100001@!5116968@!96&ri#focus">Thomas, 
        Andrews, and Penniman</a>," proprietors of a printery at 45 State Street 
        in Albany. 
      <p>He seems to have married (but <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rBrUERS0B38C&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22loring+andrews%22+albany&source=bl&ots=ZYgSPmLxc8&sig=4hjyXzgp2-19k4s4wmSZckqH47s&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA45,M1">not</a> 
        to Frances Sedgewick) and to have raised a family (some born in Albany 
        about 1800) who became successful beyond Albany. 
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and 
        lot in the first ward were valued modestly on the Albany assessment roll. 
        His lot on Hudson Street was shown on a property <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">map</a> 
        dated 1800. 
      <p>In 1800, he was identified as the "<a href="http://libcat.mcmaster.ca/index.jsp?sid=116EEE90AE6B&Ne=8&N=4294722819&Tab=1">printer 
        to the State</a>." 
      <p>After less than a decade in Albany, Loring Andrews <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=UAGo3xzYn2EC&pg=PA139&lpg=PA139&dq=%22loring+andrews%22+albany&source=web&ots=HhZL4Bb6Zm&sig=rnu6P1S8eJSaPKz-VtXGcjbKmzM&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result">removed</a> 
        to Charleston, South Carolina where he was the publisher of <i>The Courier</i> 
        in 1803. He left the paper in 1805 and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R7UQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22loring+andrews%22+charleston&source=bl&ots=3mYNSAxTou&sig=pthCwiPvx9jGHvSwucZY78sm8AY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result#PPA96,M1">prepared</a> 
        to return to the North. However, he became ill and died in October 1805 
        at the age of thirty-eight. </p>
