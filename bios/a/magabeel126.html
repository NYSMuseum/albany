<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Magdalena Abeel</strong></a> was born about 1662. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="chabeel112.html">Stoffel Janse</a> and <a href="../c/cocroon.html">Neeltie Croon</a> Abeel. She grew up in early Albany where her father was a pioneer settler, trader, and carpenter. In 1678, she was named in her parents' <a href="../../wills/willabeel.html">joint will</a>. At that time, she was identified as seventeen-years-old and married.
   
<p>In October 1677, she married <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~nnnotables/zgwib.html">Gerardus Beekman</a> of Flatbush at the Flatbush <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced ten children.

<p>These Beekmans lived in New York and Flatbush where Gerardus was a surgeon, landholder, and official under <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a>.

<p>Magdalena Abeel Beekman lost her husband in 1728. She died in September 1730 and was buried from the New York Dutch church.

Since she lived most of her life beyond Albany, definitive demographic information has thus far eluded our inquiry.
