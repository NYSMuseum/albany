<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Abeel</b></a> was born in June 1734. She was a younger  daughter of Albany residents <a href="chabeel113.html">Christoffel</a> and <a href="../b/mgtbries6346.html">Margarita Bries</a> Abeel. She grew up in a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader's</a> home near the river in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Both parents were living well into her adulthood.</p>


<p>In November 1763, she marrried Long Island-born newcomer <a href="../w/elwillett6906.html">Elbert Willett</a>. The marriage produced no children but the couple adopted a daughter. Although her husband was a member and church officer at <a href="../../churches.html">both</a> St. Peter's and at the Reformed church, Catharina was a long-time member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the couple witnessed a number of baptisms. </p>


<p>These Willetts lived in a prominent home on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a> near Albany's main intersection. They were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#6906">mainstays</a> for many decades. </p>

<p>Catharina Abeel Willett died in May 1823 a month shy of her eighty-ninth birthday. Elbert Willett lived until 1828.</p>
