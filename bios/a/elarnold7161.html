<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Eli Arnold</strong></a> lived in Albany from the mid-1770s until after 1790. He probably was born during the 1750s or before. <a href="../../res/guess.html">M</a>ost likely, he was of <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> origins. 

<p>Arnold came to Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">War</a> for Independence. His name first appeared on a <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/abp1949.0001.001/1015?page=root;size=100;view=image">list</a> of Albany people who, in May 1775, contributed varying sums (Arnold gave 8 shillings) for the relief of Ticonderoga.

<p>Pension records <a href="http://www.fold3.com/image/#22734412">show</a> that in 1776 he was a captain serving under <a href="../d/wmduer.html">William Duer</a> in the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">procurement</a> of supplies for the American forces.

<p>In January <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/ABP1949.0001.001/931?rgn=full+text;view=image">1778</a>, "Captain Eli Arnold" and about fifteen of "his" soldiers went to the house of a <a href="../w/jowinne2983.html">John Winn</a>, and "abused" (probably berated) him.  Winn and other coopers had been employed by Arnold but they were drunk on duty according to the <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/ABP1949.0001.001/931?rgn=full+text;view=image">minutes</a> of the Albany Commissioners.

<p>In May 1778, Arnold was among those Albany residents who signed a <a href="../../doc/petwmrogers.html">petition</a> in favor of condemned horse thief and former Albany resident <a href="../r/wmrogersjr.html">William Rogers</a>.

<p>In March 1777, he is said to have married <a href="../g/geergroesbeck.html">Geertruy Groesbeck</a>. By 1793, seven children had been christened in Albany.

<p>By March 1779, he was an Albany property holder as the city assessment roll <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7161">valued</a> his house and personal property and also a separate <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#elar">lot</a> both in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In November 1780, he was <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting02paltrich#page/578/mode/2up">identified</a> as an Albany city <a href="../../trades/wood.html">cooper</a> and as a bailsman for <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">N</a>iskayuna farmer David Van Dyck by the <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>. In June 1781, he was one of the witnesses   against Edward Mc Gurkey.

<p>In October 1781, Anthony Groesbeck <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc15213.htm">released</a> an undivided one-fifth of a pasture in Rensselaerswyck to Eli Arnold, a cooper. In April 1785  Arnold, a "shopkeeper," released a lot in Albany to Groesbeck. 

<p>In December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=%22eli+arnold%22&source=bl&ots=0TkjqqMrzt&sig=PrvXhtbBYe2XWygVNc5kaccmFw8&hl=en&ei=-pHfTuzLH4b50gGbiJ2sBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22eli%20arnold%22%20&f=false">1785</a>, his account for one pound sixteen shillings was paid from the city treasury.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7161">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census in the first ward. In October 1791, he was identified as a fireman in Albany's "Division #5." After that, his name has not been enountered in the community-based record. With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on for now! 
 

</P>We seek information on the later life and passing of Eli Arnold. This one-time Albany resident has been confused with a same-named individual who went from Massachusetts to western New York (<a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=75451999">1772-1857</a> - with a stop in Albany in between)   <p></p>
