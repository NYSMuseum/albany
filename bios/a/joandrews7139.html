<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Andrews</strong></a> was born about 1732. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. At least one other same-named individual <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA54,M1">lived in Albany</a> during the early nineteenth century.

<p>This Albany-based individual was married - perhaps more than once.

<p>We think that this John Andrews lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and first appeared on Albany rolls in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7139">1788</a> 
        when his Pearl Street home was accorded a moderate assessment. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7139">1790</a>, 
        his household included a couple and two boys. A decade later only two 
        older men and a woman over forty-five years old were listed in the house 
        on the second ward <a href="../../census1800.html#7139">census</a>. 
      <p>In October <a href="../../org/cc.html#1787">1787</a>, John Andrews was 
        appointed chimney viewer for the second ward. In June <a href="../../org/cc.html#1788">1788</a>, 
        John Andrews was named constable for the second ward. In March <a href="../../org/cc.html#1798">1798</a>, 
        he was named fire inspector for the second ward. 
      <p>During the 1790s, he boarded the Lutheran evangelical <a href="../h/jochartwick.html">John 
        C. Hartwick</a> in his Albany home. 
      <p>In August <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, John Andrews 
        was listed in a book of freeholders as a merchant and a resident of the 
        second ward. 
      <p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA54,M1">1813</a>, 
        city directories gave his address as 53 North Pearl Street where he kept 
        a boarding house. Following his death, his widow maintained the business 
        at that address. As late as 1830, the directory entry identified "<a href="#chris">Christine</a>, 
        the widow of John Andrews", keeping a boarding house at the corner of 
        North Pearl and Steuben. 
      <p>John Andrews died in April 1816 at the age of eighty-four and was buried 
        in the Episcopal cemetery. </p>
