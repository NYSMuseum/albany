<strong>Andrew Abel</strong></a> was born in Hanover, <a href="../ger.html">Ger</a>many about 1745. By 1768, he had <a href="../../newcomers.html">emigrated</a> to America and was living in Albany. That September, his account for services was paid by the <a href="../../corporation.html">city government</a>.</p>

<p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1770">1770</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. A decade later, he would serve as a firemaster.

<p>In August 1771, he married <a href="../m/anmarshall7067.html">Anna Marshall</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church.</a> By 1792, nine children had been christened in his Albany church.  

<p>In October 1773, he examined by the Albany council in a voter eligibility case. From his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA256&lpg=PA256&dq=%22andries+able%22&source=bl&ots=jw6N_vpaeT&sig=7qUdNgWyA75GLWaCRwV0zKjmgHI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KjffUJGnOJG10QGK5oDIBA&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22andries%20able%22%&f=false">testimony</a>, we learn that "he was born in Hanover, that he has voted before for Aldermen and that he has also served for the City as Constable; that he taken the Oaths Alegiance &c. and has lived 20 years in this Country and that he never was out of America; that he has served his time at <a href="../g/jagroesbeck3302.html">Jacob Groesbeck</a>'s for the trade as a Shoemaker." However, he was among a number of foreign-born residents whose votes were disqualified. 



<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7068">1779</a>, his second ward house and lot were valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">assessment rolls</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7068">1781</a>, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cordwainer</a> when his name appeared on a list of non natives who had purchased the "freedom of the city."


<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> service. Afterwards, he was granted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7068">land bounty</a> right in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment.

<p>In 1790, his household was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#7068">census</a> for adjoining <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. He also owned or co-owned land in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany. 

<p>Andrew Abel died in October 1795 and was buried in the Dutch church plot. He had lived only forty-eight years. His widow remained in her 10 Orange Street home until her death in 1828.</p>
