<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Adams</strong></a> was born in July 1753. He was the son of <a href="jaadams7092.html">James</a> and Margarita Hegman Adams. He grew up in a small family in the south Albany home of a marginal <a href="../../census1756.html#175">carman</a>.

<p>Before he died in October 1762, his father named him as the eldest son among the heirs listed in his <a href="../../wills/willjaadams7092.html">will</a>.

<p>By 1776, William had married Hester Wills or Wilson. In 1776 and 1790, children were christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany.

<p>Perhaps he was the William Adams who purchased property at <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> during the early 1770s. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1773">1773</a>, he first was appointed constable for the second ward but refused to serve. Named again, in 1774, he was identified as a non resident. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1775">1775</a>, he was named constable for the third ward.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7100">1779</a>, his first ward property was accorded a modest assessment. In May of that year, the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> ordered him released on bail.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">War</a>, William Adams was identified as an enlisted member of the first and third regiments of the New York Line.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, two William Adams households were configured on the Albany County census (Cambridge and Schenectady).

<p>In February 1792, William Adams made a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">complaint</a> involving the widow Margaret Adams. At that time, he was identified as the son of the deceased James Adams. </p>

<p>We seek definitive information on the post-war life and passing of the early Albany resident named William Adams.</p>
