<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>David Abeel</strong></a> was born in April 1705. He was the son of Albany leaders <a href="jabeel124.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/caschuyler1241.html">Catharina Schuyler</a> Abeel. His father was a prominent businessman with extensive holdings in Albany and New York City. Johannes Abeel served as mayor of Albany in 1694 and again in 1709. In 1710, he was <a href="../../wills/willjabeel124.html">named</a> to share in his father's estate. His father died when he was six years old.
 
<p>Young David was sent to New York to learn the drygoods business in the house of his recently deceased uncle <a href="../s/brschuyler1092.html">Brant Schuyler</a>. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us he was mentored by his New York cousin David Schuyler.

<p>In 1726, he married Mary Duyckink and eventually <a href="../../na/na.html">settled</a> in New York. The marriage produced several children most of whom were christened in New York where he served as a baptism sponsor as late as 1763.

<p>This Manhattan mainliner was a merchant and militia officer. 

<p>According to his <a href="#stone">gravestone</a>, Albany native David Abeel died in October 1776 at the age of seventy-two. The stone (still standing in a New Jersey field) noted that he had been a New York merchant. His widow is said to have died in New York City in 1780.</p>
