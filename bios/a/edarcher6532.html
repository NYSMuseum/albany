<strong>Edward Archer</strong></a> was born before 1735. A number of variations in the <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elling of his <a href="#sp">surname</a> have been encountered. <a href="#source">P</a>erhaps he was the son of a William Orchard of Johnston who was killed by Indians.

<p>His wife was Catherine (Magie or Carter). In 1773, they were identified as new members of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. At that time, their family included four children - at least three of whom had been christened at St. Peter's between 1755 and 1761. 

<p>In October <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, his Albany holdings were lightly assessed - the only time his name actually appears on a city assessment roll. 


<p>In July 1780, he appeared before the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Co</a>mmissioners and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5vm7k0yfMesC&pg=PA454&lpg=PA454&dq=%22edward+archer%22+albany&source=bl&ots=uIF4jgsn6w&sig=4ze0oppahTfB0I9TG18wf8LyRHE&hl=en&ei=-AADSp63BKWDlAe6r53gBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1">reported</a> on a subversive declaration he had overheard. At that time, he was identified as a resident of the city of Albany. In March 1779, he had been sent as a guide with a party in search of Tories. Later, his account for twenty-two pounds was paid by the Commissioners. He may have served in the Revolutionary army. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6532">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In April 1781, an unspecified entity (document [LWS 4508-1 ] found in an Albany context) contracted with an <a href="http://www.nps.gov/archive/morr/smith/the_lloyd_w_smith_collection.htm">Edward Orchard</a> to keep two rooms in good order.

<p>In 1788, "Edward Orchard" owed a pound to the <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#6532">estate</a> of a deceased Albany physician. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6532">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. After that, his name dropped from Albany rolls.

<p>In May 1812, an Edward Archer was named as a son in the <a href="../../wills/willgearcher.html">will</a> filed by Albany resident <a href="gearcher6534.html">George Archer</a>. Perhaps the testator was the brother or son of Edward.
