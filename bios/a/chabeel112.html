<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"><strong>Christopher Abeel</strong></a> was born in Amsterdam, Holland about 1621. He emigrated to New Netherland and settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he was <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as "Stoffel Janse."

<p>In November 1660, he married <a href="../c/cocroon.html">Neeltie Croon</a>. The marriage produced at least four children who established the Abeel family in Albany and its environs for generations to come.

<p>Stoffel Janse was a carpenter/builder who was present at the initial distribution of houselots in 1652. He was called a "master carpenter" and is said to have supervised construction of the new <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1656 and later served as a deacon.

<p>In 1665, he returned to Holland to attend to family business. He returned to Albany later in the year.

<p>Although not identified among the principal <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a>, he served as an attorney and was appointed commissary and then magistrate in 1664. During that time he was active trader in <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>.

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WBdCh9uazCQC&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=stavast+albany&source=bl&ots=lDfvBMc4nD&sig=3ZXixtDs-cHIMMssgzkxODFTpng&hl=en&ei=aWloS76RKcfT8Abw_sjABw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBIQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=stavast%20albany&f=false">1667</a>, the governor deeded him a  a houselot along the Albany waterfront. He would own other Albany properties as well.

<p> In <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>, his name was absent from a census of Albany householders.

<p>Christopher and Neeltie Abeel filed a joint <a href="../../wills/willabeel.html">will</a> in December 1678. He died in 1680 and was buried by his widow on August 4. In 1694, his <a href="jabeel124.html">son</a> was appointed mayor of Albany.
