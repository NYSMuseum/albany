<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Christopher Abeel</strong></a> was born in August 1764. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jaabeel122.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="../vb/egvburen.html">Egbertie Van Buren</a> Abeel. He grew up as an older child in a large city-based family.

<p>Coming of age towards the end of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">conflict</a>, afterwards his name was included on a list of <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#114">bounty right</a> recipients in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia regiment</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1787">1787</a>, he was appointed chimney viewer for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. The following March, he was identified as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fireman</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#114">1788</a>, his modest personal property was valued under the third ward house of <a href="../w/elwillett6906.html">Elbert Willett</a> whose wife was Christopher's <a href="caabeel109.html">aunt</a>. Perhaps, he was the other adult male counted on the census of Willett's household in <a href="../../census1790.html#6906">1790</a>.

<p>In 1795, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">saddler</a> (Elbert Willett's core trade) of Saratoga County.

<p>In June 1796, Christopher Abeel <a href="http://saratoganygenweb.com/srdcmars.htm">married</a> Jane Swart at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Schuylerville. He was gone from Albany by <a href="../../census1800.html#6906">1800</a>. 
 
<p>In 1850, eighty-six-year-old Christopher Abeel was <a href="http://ancestry.com">listed</a> on the Federal census for Saratoga. At that time, his househld included his 84-year-old wife Sara and three younger Abeels. His occupation was given as farmer. He had 23 acres of improved land with livestock and his real estate was valued at $1380.

<p>Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">na</a>tive Christopher Abeel <a href="../../res/death.html">died</a> sometime afterward. He had lived for more than 80 years.</p>
