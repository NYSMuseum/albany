<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Alexander</strong></a> was born in 1726. He was the son of Scottish emigre&acute; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Alexander_(lawyer)">James Alexander</a> and the widow <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&pg=PA35&lpg=PA365dq=%22mary+alexander%22+1756&source=bl&ots=mazJlTL7fk&sig=RdiDvbtl7CrHX_XEfvCd-N8I5ZQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=52rsUP7_M8zU0gGLp4HAAg&ved=0CHUQ6AEwDg#v=onepage&q=%22mary%20alexander%22%201756&f=false">Mary Spratt Provoost</a> of NYC. His talented and experienced father was one of the more formidable British supporters in New York and New Jersey. In poor health, James Alexander died in 1756 following a <a href="http://www.jerseyhistory.org/findingaid.php?aid=0070">trip</a> to Albany.

<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/wmalexander.jpg" align=left border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200 height=250 alt="William Alexander"></a>William was the eldest surviving son of the union of Manhattan moguls. His very able <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rVLOhGt1BX0C&pg=PA36&lpg=PA36dq=%22mrs+alexander%22+1756&source=bl&ots=mazJlTL7fk&sig=RdiDvbtl7CrHX_XEfvCd-N8I5ZQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=52rsUP7_M8zU0gGLp4HAAg&ved=0CHUQ6AEwDg">mother</a> would become his mentor and business partner.

<p>In March 1748, he married Albany native <a href="../l/salivingston.html">Sara Livingston</a>. The union produced three children who were to be raised in an affluent New York home.

<p>In June 1754, he attended the <a href="../../albanycongress.html">Albany Congress</a> in place of his ailing father. During the <a href="../../7yw.html">last colonial war</a>, he was in the British army commissariat and also was engaged in private contracting to supply the royal and colonial war effort on the northern frontier. As aide-de-camp, he worked closely with <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Shirley"">William Shirley</a>, governor of Massachusetts and commander of the provincial forces operating out of Albany.  

<p>In 1756, Alexander sailed to England to testify at conduct inquiries on Shirley's behalf. Over the next few years in England, he claimed he had claimed a hereditary title as "Earl of Stirling."

<p>Upon returning to America in 1761, he <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alexander,_Lord_Stirling">established</a> himself on an estate in New Jersey ready to take his place among the American aristocracy.

<p>At the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, Alexander's commission in the New Jersey militia led to his appointment as Brigadier General in the Revolutionary army in 1776. His wartime <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Alexander,_Lord_Stirling">career</a> was steller and would place him in command of the northern army at Albany in 1781.

<p>In 1779, Alexander's daughter married British background but Revolutionary operative and speculator <a href="../d/wmduer.html">William Duer</a>. "Kitty" and Duer sought to raise their family in Albany while Lord Stirling passed his final years.

<p>Chronically ill from an excessive life-style, fifty-seven-year-old William Alexander <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=F4EDAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA258&lpg=PA258&dq=%22william+alexander%22+illness+albany&source=bl&ots=HZ0pmmOVoe&sig=k-ZQNb4-R3Z5wvYfd8anh-B7PH8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7dvuUNWiF8ar0AGV1YDgBw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22william%20alexander%22%20illness%20albany&f=false">died</a> in Albany in January 1783. He was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> but finally was interred in Trinity churchyard in New York.</p>
