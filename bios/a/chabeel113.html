<P><a href="#sources"><b>Christoffel (Christopher) Abeel</b></a> was born in December 1696. He was the eldest son of Mayor <a href="jabeel124.html">Johannes Abeel</a> and his wife, <a href="../s/caschuyler1241.html">Catharina Schuyler</a> Abeel. He grew up in his father's house on Market Street in Albany and in New York where Johannes Abeel also lived and conducted business. In 1710, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjabeel124.html">will</a> of his father who died the following year. His mother <a href="../b/rjbleecker227.html">re-married</a> in 1712 and had four more children.</p>


<p>In September 1720, Christopher was an aspiring <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> when he married Albany native <a href="../b/mgtbries6346.html">Margarita Bries</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740, four of their children had been christened in Albany where he was a member and pewholder.</p>

<p>His home was in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He was an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#327">mainstay</a> and freeholder but probably spent a large portion of his time trading beyond Albany. He also <a href="../../res/realestate.html">owned land</a> in the Albany hinterland and conveyed a parcel in 1771.</p> 

<p>Christopher lost his wife in 1758. He probably died during the early 1770s as his name was absent from Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">rolls</a> after 1771. Christopher Abeel had lived into his seventies.</p>
