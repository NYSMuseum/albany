<P><a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Andriese</strong></a> (de <a href="#name">Cuyper</a>) probably was born close to 1650. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. He sometimes is confused with a similarly named and probably older <a href="jaand.html">contemporary</a> whose primary focus was more south of Albany. 

      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#7142">1683</a> and afterwards, he 
        was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where, 
        during the 1680s and 90s, he witnessed a number of baptisms. The Dutch 
        church records for those years do not mention a spouse or family. 
      <p>As early as 1667, "Jan Andriese" (along with one "Matewis Abrams") signed a petition asking for a gate to be made running from the river up the hill.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#38">1679</a>, he was listed on a census of Albany householders who would be responsible for two rods of the stockade fence. Two years later, "Jan And. Cuyper"  was among those Albany "burghers" who were solicited regarding the calling of a second minister. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1686">1686</a>, "the cooper" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7#v=onepage&q=jan%20andriese%20cuyper&f=false">listed</a> among the assistant alderman. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1695">1695</a>, he was identified as the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> assistant. In 1696, "the cooper" was appointed surveyor of weights and measures. However, his name does not seem to have appeared on other obvious community-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">survey lists</a> during those years.

<p>In 1701, Jan Andriese was among the Albany area Protestants who signed a petition to the royal governor.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his property in the third ward was assessed moderately. After that, his name is missing from the community-based record.

<p>We seek information on the later <a href="../../res/bios.html">life</a> and passing of the Albany resident known as "Jan Andriese de Cuyper." Following our most recent sweep of the <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a>, we move on for now!</p>
