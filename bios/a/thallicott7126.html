<P><a href="#sources"><b>Thomas Allicott</b></a> was a <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free person of color</a> living in the city of Albany.</p>

<p>He was born about 1755 and was fifty-years-old in April 1804 when he was freed by Albany businessman and officeholder <a href="../l/abglansing3695.html">Abraham G. Lansing</a>. He was married to Catherine and had a son <a href="thallicott412.html">Thomas</a> who was born into slavery in 1799.</p> 

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, city directories identify him variously as a "laborer," <a href="../../peoplestreet.html#cartman">cartman</a>, and grocer. In <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#1815">1815</a>, he was living at 39 Columbia Street. In 1821, "Alicot & Anthony" were listed as grocers at 22 Washington.</p>

<p>In 1818, he purchased the remaining time of his nineteen-year-old son, Thomas, from attorney <a href="../l/stlush416.html">Stephen Lush</a>.</p>

<p>Subsequent directories list a Thomas Allicot as a "waiter" as late as 1830 - but that may have been his son. Although he was free since 1804, census rolls do not include the name of this prominent <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro-Albanian</a>!</p>
