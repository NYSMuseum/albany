<strong>George Archer</strong></a> probably was born between 1756 and 1774. His name first appeared on Albany rolls after the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. His name did <a href="#br">not</a> appear on the land bounty rights list in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>He was married to a woman named Mary or Molly (who was born about 1767) and was the father of at least seven children - most of whom raised families in upstate New York. At least one of his children was christened at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.

<p>George <a href="../../res/sp.html">Ar</a>cher was known as a teamster or carman and later involved his sons in his <a href="../../econ/trans.html#overland">overland</a> transport business. He also had one or more stores up on Eagle Street near Pine and also Steuben. His property bordered on the "<a href="../../loc/publicsq.html">Public Square</a>."

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6534">1788</a>, his second ward house and lot were valued on the city assessment roll. His son and possibly another boarder were referenced at that Pine Street location as well. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6534">1790</a>, his household included four people. He was an Albany <a href="../../census1800.html#6534">mainliner</a> for the rest of his life with seven boys and men in his household in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1790c">1810</a>. 

<p>George Archer filed a <a href="../../wills/willgearcher.html">will</a> in May 1812. In 1813, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> listed him as a "teamster" living at 27 Pine Street. He was dead before printing of the Directory for 1814. In 1815, the Directory listed his widow at 29 Pine and three of his sons as teamsters living on Pine Street as well. His will passed probate in October 1823.
