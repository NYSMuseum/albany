<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously,  <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Zoble</strong></a> (aka Sobel) was an Albany resident during the second half of the eighteenth century. He probably was born during the 1730s or 40s and may have been the "John Wilhelm Zobel" who emigrated to Boston in 1751 and who was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> in New York in December 1768. We seek more definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. He is not contemporary Albany resident <a href="../s/wmsole.html">William Sole</a>.

<p>In October 1762, "William Zobre" and "Christina Zegier" received a New York <a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">marriage license</a>. His marriage probably to a member of the <a href="../s/joseeger7002.html">Se</a>eger family most likely produced children whose names have not been found in the available records of early <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>. However, during the 1760s and 70s these Zobels witnessed baptisms in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch</a> and <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> churches.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his house and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> were accorded moderate assessments. His name also was on the roster of an <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> company. In 1779, his <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6988">home</a> and extra <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#wz6988">lo</a>t were valued on first ward assessments.


<p>In October 1780, Zoble was <a href="../../cddc.html">id</a>entified as a "Tobaconist" of the city of Albany when he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZXHfeDs_6DoC&pg=PA551&lpg=PA551&dq=reverend+swertfeger+zoble&source=bl&ots=ixOSFm69iS&sig=ruKawNQoXDRy15BtTVcKnvmG_Ho&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NPweT4u5IYf10gGAysUG&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=reverend%20swertfeger%20zoble&f=false">posted</a> a bond for the Reverend Samuel Swertfeger, an outlying preacher who had come under <a href="../../friends.html">suspicion</a>.

<p>During the late 1760s, he had <a href="../../res/realestate.html">obtained</a> city lots near Albany's southern border. In September 1785, he purchased (leased) a number of lots into which the "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA256&dq=%22william+zoble%22+old+store&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1CYfT_y9IuXk0QG25PUF&ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20zoble%22%20old%20store&f=false">old store was divided</a>" from the city at an annual rent of twenty shillings. Two years later, he was being called on to pay his rents.
 
<p>In 1785 and again in 1787, the city treasury <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=%22william+zoble%22+january+1785&source=bl&ots=0TknsnJtxn&sig=z0bTLw0ihJONuutIGF1P9guD4EY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ACgfT6zFEMbW0QHgzrEG&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20zoble%22%20january%201785&f=false">paid</a> his accounts of  more than thirty-two and twenty-one shillings respectively. After that, his name has not been encountered in the community-based record.

<p>William Zoble was dead by January 26, 1789 when his will passed probate. Albany resident <a href="hezob.html">Henry Zoble</a>, who was the owner of record in the a familiar location in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6989">1788</a>, probably was William Zoble's son.</p>
