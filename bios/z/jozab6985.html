<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EdoMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA51&lpg=PA51&dq=%22john+zabriskie%22">sources</a>, 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>John Ja. Zabriskie</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled variously) was born in February 1752. He was the son of Jacob J. and Sara Varick Zabriskie of Hackensack, New Jersey. His father was the third generation descendant of a native of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EdoMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22abraham+zabriskie%22">Poland</a> who was educated in Amsterdam;  came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the 1660s, and, a decade later, was settled in New Jersey. His mother was a daughter of a prominent New York family. 

<p>In November 1776, he married <a href="../l/lelansing3462.html">Lena Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A daughter was born at the end of June. Their son was christened in Albany in 1779. Another daughter arrived in February 1782.

<p>Because another <a href="jozab6986.html">John Zabriskie</a> married and lived in Albany at that time, we are less certain about the assignment of qualitative information. This sketch seeks to include information specific to John Ja[cob] (or Joost) Zabriskie - a frequently used name in the community.

<p>At this point, we are uncertain (beyond the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">obvious</a>) as to what brought several New Jersey Zabriskies to Albany around that time. 

<p>Early in 1777, he complained to the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany committee</a> that Albert Vanderzee refused to accept Continental currency in payment for boards and planks. In December 1777, "Jno. Jost Zabriskie" witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjovdouw.html">will</a> of Johannes Vol. Douw of Albany County.

<p>In March 1779, John Zabriskie's personal property was <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6985">valued</a> within a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> household.

<p>In  September <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779pe">1779</a>, he was among a number of Albany mainliners who petitioned the governor for the return of <a href="../vd/hvdyck832.html">Dr. Van Dyck</a> - an incarcerated loyalist. In November <a href="../../org/cc.html#1779">1779</a>, an individual by the name of "John I. Zabrisky" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22collections+on+the+history+of+albany%22zabrisky%22&printsec=frontcover&source=web&ots=wwgFcQx8ir&sig=YP4BhVLTpmUam-6sJc2hVWSoX68&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA303,M1">appointed</a> firemaster for the third ward.

<p>We feel that the Albany business combination known as "Zabrisky & Lansing" references the business of this individual. However, most references to it are dated after the death date of John Ja. Zabriskie. In 1782, the following advertisment ran in the New-York Gazetteer: "Zabrisky & Lansing, merchants - between the Dutch church and the Market House, A large quantity of Phildelphia Earthen Ware and . . . "
<p>At some point, the <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6985">name</a> of "John J. Zabrisky" was included on a list of those who were entitled to land bounty rights in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment.
 
<p>The first Albany John Zabriskie died in April 1782. He had lived but thirty years. His Albany-born widow re-married several years later and lived until 1826. In March 1786, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA488,M1">his father's will</a> noted that John was deceased and that Jacob Zabriskie's three grandchildren were living with their maternal grandfather, John Lansing, at Albany. Their <a href="jolzab.html">son</a> became an notable cleric.</p>

The life of John Ja. Zabriskie is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6985. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. The Zabriskies (<a href="http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.sobieszczyk/1.17/mb.ashx">Sobieski</a> also "Albrecht Zaborowski") were a pioneer family of New Jersey and have been studied extensively. The purpose of this sketch is to help explain the Albany lives of several Zabriskie family members.<p></p>
