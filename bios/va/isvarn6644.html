      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Isaac Van Arnhem</strong></a> was born in 
        August 1745. He was the son of Albany-area residents Jan and Elizabeth 
        Lansing Van Arnhem. He sometimes was known as "Isaac J. Van Arnhem." 
      <p>In August 1768, he married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        native Catharina Van Wie at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. At the time of his marriage, he was identified as <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rbillard/schenectady_marriages.htm">of</a> 
        Heldebergh. By 1781, five children had been christened in Albany. 
      <p>This Van Arnhem family lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a> where Isaac's property was assessed as early as 1766. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6644">1788</a>, 
        his property was of moderate value. By <a href="../../census1790.html#6644">1790</a>, 
        his family had become Market Street <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">mainstays</a>. 
      <p>He probabaly derived his living in the commercial economy - although 
        direct references to his business have not yet been found. On occasion, 
        he was identified as a hatter. In 1759 and in 1763, he served as <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">firemaster</a> 
        in the third ward. In 1767, he purchased a lot near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a>. 
      <p>He probably was the Isaac Van Arnhem who was named fence viewer for the 
        new settlement at <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> in 1771. 
      <p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he was elected to represent the 
        third ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> 
        and served throughout the life of the organization. In 1777, he was appointed 
        chairman pro temp. He supported the American cause in a number of <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#6644">ways</a> 
        during the 1770s. After the war, he was an overseer of the <a href="../../poor.html">poor</a> 
        and also an election inspector. 
      <p>His modest third ward home was listed on the city assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">rolls</a> 
        for 1799 and in 1802. After that, the name of Isaac Van Arnhem passed 
        from Albany rolls. He is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=vnfa&id=I2769">said</a> 
        to have been a resident of Guilderland. The will of an "Isaac J. Van Arnhem" 
        passed probate in albany County in March 1829.
