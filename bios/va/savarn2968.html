<P><a href="#sources"><b>Sara Van Arnhem</b></a> was born in April 1732. She was the daughter of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents Abraham and Alida Lansing Van Arnhem.</p>

<p>In September 1752, she married <a href="../c/joclute1637.html">John Clute, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1775, eleven children were christened in the Albany church where both parents were pewholders and Sara was a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>John Clute, Jr. was a businessman and silversmith. These Clutes set up their home on the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north side</a> of Albany and raised their large family in a modest city house.</p>

<p>Sara Van Arnhem Clute witnessed a baptism with her son, Gerrit Clute, in October 1788. That was the last recorded lifesign for her encountered to date. Clute probably had passed by that time.</p>
