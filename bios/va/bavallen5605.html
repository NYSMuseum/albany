<strong>Barent Van Allen</strong></a> was born in the Fall of 1738 and christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on October 1. He was the son of Albany mariner <a href="pivallen5632.html">Pieter Van Allen</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vb/anvbt5401.html">Anna Van Benthuysen</a> Van Allen.


<p>His father died in 1749 when Barent was just eleven. Raised by his mother, he probably did not marry but resided in his family's first ward <a href="../../census1790.html#5623">home</a> with his brother and partner, <a href="jovallen5623.html">John Van Allen</a>. Barent was a lifelong member and pewholder of the Dutch church.

<p>In 1764 and 1766 he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the first ward. His social network included membership in Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> companies and the Albany watch. In 1766, he opposed the Stamp Act when he signed a <a href="../../solconst.html#5605">constitution</a> for the Albany Sons of Liberty. Later, his sloop was utilized by the Revolutionaries.  As a businessman and shipper, his activities came under the scrutiny of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> during the 1770s. However, later, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#v">land bounty right</a> for service.

<p>Although his older brother was identifed as the head of their Albany household, Barent was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5605">named</a> on a number of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> as the co-owner of their Albany properties.

<p>In March 1794, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html">will</a> of William Shepard.

 <p>Barent Van Allen died on October 1, 1799 at the age of sixty-three. In that year, a  substantial home on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> was listed on the assessment roll under the tenure of "heirs of John and Barent Van Allen." </p>
