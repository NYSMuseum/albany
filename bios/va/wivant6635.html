<strong>Wilhelmus Van Antwerpen</strong></a> was born in January 1722. He was the son of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents Daniel and Ariaantie <a href="../v/veeder.html">Veeder</a> Van Antwerpen. He was known as "Helmer" and "Helmus," exotic <a href="../../res/sp.html">variants</a> of William.

<p>In March 1744, he married Hilletie <a href="../vv/vvranken.html">Van Vranken</a> of <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a> at the Schenectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced several children.

<p>Wilhelmus Van Antwerpen settled in Albany where he was known as a Hudson River <a href="../../census1756.html#289">skipper</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6635">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. During the 1760s, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> holdings were accorded a moderate assessment. At the same time, he held modestly valued land in Schenectady and in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West Manor</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the second ward. Over the next decades, he was occasionally reimbursed by the city for services.  In <a href="../../solconst.html#6635">1766</a>, he signed the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. 

<p>Over the next years, he relocated to the Mohawk.

<p>Wilhelmus Van Antwerpen filed a will in November 1781. At that time, he was living in <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canastagauna</a>. It mentioned his wife and several children. The will passed probate in November 1784. He had lived about sixty years.</p>
