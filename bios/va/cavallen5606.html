<strong>Catharina Van Allen</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="lovallen5624.html">Lourens</a> and Elbertje Everts Van Allen. Shortly after her birth, her father moved their family to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. 


<p>In May 1696, she married <a href="../vd/mevdp6269.html">Melgert Vanderpoel, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1716, the marriage had produced nine children who were christened in the Albany church where she was a member.

<p>These Vanderpoels set up their <a href="../../census1697.html#144">home</a> in Albany's second ward where Melgert was involved in civic activities. 

<p>In 1712, he received land on the east side of the Hudson below Albany from Catharina's father. He then moved his family to Kinderhook to settle permanently. 

<p>Catharina Van Allen Vanderpoel was last mentioned in the record of the baptism of her last child in December 1716. Her husband lived on for several years. We seek information on her passing!</p>
