<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Rynier Van Alstyne</strong></a> was born in April 1725. He was the only son born to the brief marriage of Albany area residents <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=norvan&id=I394537">Ja</a>cob and Pieterje Van Iveren Van Alstyne. That family was capped at four when Rynier lost his father in 1730.

<p>In November 1748, he married <a href="../vd/vdb.html">Cornelia Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1760, four of their children reflecting the names of both sets of grandparents had been christened in the church where both parents were pewholders and occasional baptism sponsors.

<p>This Van Alstyne family made its home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. During the 1750s and 60s they were city mainliners where "Rynar Van Alstin" was known as a <a href="../../census1756.html#62">shoemaker</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, their home on the hill was profiled by the British as being suitable for quartering six to eight soldiers. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his house in the second ward was accorded a substantial assessment. That roll also valued another lot in the same section of the city. In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6630">1779</a>, his lot (without personal property) in the second ward was assessed modestly.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1746">1746</a>, "Reynier v. Alstyn" had been named constable for the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1753">1753</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the third ward. In 1767, his name was listed on the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA803&lpg=RA12-PA803&dq=ryner&source=web&ots=hq0KulgrC3&sig=KO3WO4tIB1dP9VDxGJLcFoFoa8s#v=onepage&q&f=false">roster</a> of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22van+alstyne%22&source=bl&ots=wygGcUBdfs&sig=IKuJBtr5hodoN0I48VnkoJP3WCU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=B32BVc64Aa7isATkwoDgDg&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22van%20alstyne%22&f=false">November</A> of that year, the Albany council directed a payment of &pound;30 to "Bastiaen Visher & Rynier Van Alstyne" for services to the city. 

<p>Just fifty at the outbreak of hostilities, we expect to find some involvement for him during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a> of the American Revolution. This Rynier probably relocated to the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> during that time as later he was <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">accorded</a> a "land bounty right" in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u-81AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=Reynier+Aalsteyn&source=bl&ots=RQ36kyt6Ka&sig=gBE8mKvwiBMY9onxnSsIhM47hzk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UI-BVe_3I6XjsASC0oPICw&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Reynier%20Aalsteyn&f=false">conjunction</a> with the Fifth Regiment of the Albany County militia. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the Rensselaerswyck household of seven members and two slaves was configured on the census under "<a  href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1g9Qu5LmecEC&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%22Rhineas+Van+Alstine%22&source=bl&ots=7ohjvO9IYn&sig=fVSONzgJ6xIxJv48774BvPKPB7w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCYQ6AEwAWoVChMIweGTwIyUxgIVA2SMCh0K1AAC#v=onepage&q=%22Rhineas%20Van%20Alstine%22&f=false">Rhineas</a>" Van Alstine next to the household of one Jacob Van Alstine. In April 1791, "Reynier Van Aalsteyn" <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">leased</a> a farm of 269 acres in Greenbush (De Freestville section) from the Van Rensselaers.

<p>In October 1794, "Rynier Van Alstyne" was listed among the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4v9HAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230&dq=%22rynier+van+alstyne%22&source=bl&ots=aT3fCTaTGW&sig=mmAYPcwNThFmvSUirzw6_eplW6M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GX6BVbaiGamSsQSf7byYBA&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22rynier%20van%20alstyne%22&f=false">members</a> of the "Reformed Church at Greenbush."

      <p>After that, the existence of a younger, same-named contemporary dictates caution 
        in the assignment of qualitative information. 
      <p>As late as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, his lot "in Fox St" was assessed nominally but he was identified as a "non resident."

<p>We seek defining information on the later life and passing of one-time Albany resident Rynier Van Alstyne. Family-based resources <a href="http://www.vanalstyne.com/family/familygroup.php?familyID=F1804&tree=VanAlstyne">estimate</a> that he may have lived until 1825.</p>
