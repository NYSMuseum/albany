<P>According to <a href="http://frostandgilchrist.com/getperson.php?personID=I4025&tree=frostinaz01">family-based</a> resources, the Albany County settler known as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham Janse Van Alstyne</strong></a> was born in Meppel, Drenthe about 1650. Thus, he would have emigrated with his parents <a href="../../nnd.html">New</a> Netherland pioneers <a href="jamvalst.html">Jan Martense</a> and Dirckje Harmens Van Alystyne. He grew up in a large family with siblings born on both sides of the Atlantic. For the first half of his life he was <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> mostly as "Abraham Janse."

<p>The Van Alstynes were among the early settlers of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. His parents died there prior to 1700. In <a href="../../census1697.html#abva">1697</a>, the household of "Abraham Janse" was configured on a census of greater <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 

<p>His first wife is <a href="http://frostandgilchrist.com/getperson.php?personID=I4025&tree=frostinaz01">said</a> to have been one "Jannetje Thomasz Mingael," the mother of several of their children. In January 1694, he married <a href="../vd/mavdu5553.html">Maritie Van Deusen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1719, he may have fathered as many as fourteen children. Beginning in 1683, Abraham Janse's name was included among church members.

In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#abjva">1699</a>, "Abr. Janse Ayesteyn" was among those who signed a loyalty oath to the Protestant king of England. After that, we have not encountered this individual in the community-based record. By that time, additional same-named individuals are at risk in greater Albany County.

<p>With conflicting information on the individual known as "Abraham Janse Van Alstyne" we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
