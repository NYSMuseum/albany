<P><a href="#sources"><b>Willem Van Allen</b></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the American-born son of <a href="pivallen5629.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../t/mateller6616.html">Maria Teller</a> Van Allen. His father died in 1674 and his mother re-married.</p>


<p>He married <a href="../vp/mavpatten2129.html">Maria Van Patten</a> in November 1695. By 1710, their eight children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>In 1697, his <a href="../../census1697.html#014">budding family</a> was configured on the Albany census. Two years later, he joined with his neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5687">swearing allegiance</a> to the King of England. In 1702 and 1709, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property supported a substantial <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5687">assessment</a> - comparable to that of successful merchant/traders. During the early 1700s, he served his community as a juror and assessor for the first ward. In 1715, his name was on the <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">roster</a> of a troop of horse in the Albany militia. </p>

<p>He was known as a mariner and as master of a vessel that sailed to Albany. In 1715, he was left personal property including wheelwright's tools in the <a href="../../wills/willgevness899.html">will</a> of his step-father. 

<p>In 1717, he was identified as in possession of a farm in Bethlehem in a Van Rensselaer <a href="../../wills/willkvr5054.html">will</a>.</p>

<p>In June 1737, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjrosie.html">will</a> of Jan Rosie.

<p>Willem Van Allen died in April 1753.</p>
