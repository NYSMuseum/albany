<strong>Johannes Van Allen</strong></a> was born during the 1670s. He was the son of Albany residents  <a href="pivallen5629.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../t/mateller6616.html">Maria Teller</a> Van Allen. His father died in 1674 and his mother re-married.

<p>In December 1701, he married <a href="../t/chtbroeck23.html">Christina Ten Broeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She was the daughter of his father's one-time servant  who, at that time, was one of the most important personages in the upriver region of New York. By 1710, five of their children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Van Allens set up their home in Albany's first ward near the church. Johannes was a businessman whose name consistantly was included on community-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">survey</a> documents. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5621">1709</a>, his Albany property was assessed at a rate accorded other successful merchants. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5621">1720</a> and 
<a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5621">1742</a>, he was identified as an Albany freeholder living in the first ward.

<p>During the early 1700s, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and juror but held no higher <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">offices</a> in city government. Also, he does not seem to have been connected to the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.  


<p>Johannes Van Allen died in April 1750 and was buried from his Albany church.</p>
