<strong>Lourens Van Allen</strong></a> may have been born in Hallen in the Netherlands in 1642. He emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and was living in or near <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> in <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#5624">1660</a> when he signed a petition asking for closer regulation of the fur trade.

<p>During the 1670s, he owned a house and lot in Albany located on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> between what became Maiden Lane and Steuben Street. In <a href="../../census1679.html#5624">1679</a>, his name was included on a census of Albany householders. In <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#5624">1681</a>, he was among the Albany burghers who petitioned the court for more structure in regulation of the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>.

<p>His wife was Elbertje Everts. Six children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and supporter. In 1712, his will would name nine living children - although his wife was not listed!

<p>Lourens served on Albany juries and was appointed assistant <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> in 1686. 

<p>In 1680, he petitioned for a tract of land at <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>.  Later, he would liquidate some of his Albany holdings and relocate there. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">1684</a>, his back taxes were paid by <a href="../l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a> on his behalf. By <a href="../../census.html">1697</a>, his name was included on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> census. In 1690, he was commissioned a justice of the peace. In 1703, he was identified as one of the Kinderhook trustees.


<p>Stating he was a resident of Kinderhook, Lourens Van Allen filed a <a href="../../wills/willlovallen.html">will</a> in March 1712. It named nine living children and identified extensive real estate including <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">property</a> in Albany.  He was dead by October 1714 when the will passed probate.</p>
