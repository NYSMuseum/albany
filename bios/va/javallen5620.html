<strong>Jannetje Van Allen</strong></a> was born in May 1736. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="pivallen5632.html">Pieter Van Allen</a> and his second wife,  <a href="../vb/anvbt5401.html">Anna Van Benthuysen</a> Van Allen. She grew up in a skipper's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Her father died in 1749 and her mother continued to <a href="../../census1756.html#97">raise</a> a large blended family.


<p>In March 1761, she married newcomer <a href="../l/ablyle1169.html">Abraham Lyle</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, their two children were christened at Rhineback in Dutchess County in 1762 and 1764.

<p>By the mid-1760s, they had settled in Albany's first ward where Lyle found success as a merchant - no doubt in concert with his <a href="jovallen5623.html">brothers-in-law</a>.  

<p>However, her <a href="../../marriages.html">ma</a>rriage would not enjoy longevity. Lyle filed a <a href="../../wills/willablyle.html">will</a> in October 1766. It named Jannetje as heir and co-executor and provided for their two children as well. He died soon afterwards. In March 1770, she still had open accounts from her husband's business.

<p>The widow Jannetje Van Allen Lyle probably moved in with her bachelor <a href="bavallen5605.html">brothers</a> in their family <a href="../../census1790.html#5623">home</a> on State Street. In 1801, her name appeared on two real estate transactions. She would have been seventy-five at that time.</p>
