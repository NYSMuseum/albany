<a href="#sources"><strong>Martin Janse Van Alstyne</strong></a> was born in July 1655. He was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="jamvalst.html">Jan Martense</a> and Dirckie Harmens Van Alstyne. Perhaps he was born in New Amsterdam or <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> while a number of his older siblings were born in Europe.

<p>By 1680, he had married Jannetie Cornelis [<a href="../b/bogert.html">Bogert</a>]. By 1703, at least seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and supporter.

<p>These Van Alstynes lived <a href="../../loc/northend.html">outside</a> the Albany stockade. He appears to have appeared before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> during the early 1680s. Because he was more widely known as "Martin Janse," we are careful not to force qualitative information into this Van Alstyne portrait.

<p>Martin Janse Van Alstyne died sometime after 1701.

The life of Martin Janse <a href="valst.html">Van Alstyne</a> has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources often assign a death date of 1765 (110 years old?) and a second marriage to Cornelia Vandenbergh and subsequent children to this individual. His son, Martin (1682-1765), is a more likely candidate.
