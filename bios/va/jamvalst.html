<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Jan Martense Van Alstyne</strong></a> was born in Drenthe in 1623. About 1652, he emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> to work for the West India Company. He returned to Europe and came back to stay a few years later. By the mid-1640s, he was married to Dirckie Harmens. Their marriage produced at least nine children born in both Europe and America. 

<p>He was the patriarch of the <a href="valst.html">Van Alstyne family</a> of early Albany and greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.

<p>In 1657, he was in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and was identified as the owner of a lot on the east side what became <a href="../../streets.html#market">Broadway</a> - beyond the <a href="../../map/map1676.html">original</a> stockade. He may have held that lot until the 1690s. He seems to have owned land in what became Ulster County and in the area around Kinderhook - his primary place of residence.

<p>He also was known as "de wever" - but he may not necessarily have been a weaver. Janny Venema has carefully <a href="../../books.html#jv">chronicled</a> his Beverwyck days calling Jan and his wife "tavernkeepers" who lived <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> of the settlement.
 
<p>He was the co-owner of a yacht that carried cargoes on the <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">Hudson</a>.

<p>By 1669, he was associated with the settlement and development of the lands that became <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. In 1679, he was named assistant deputy <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> for Kinderhook.

<p>His wife may have died at Kinderhook in 1682. A "Jan Martense Van Alstyne" is said to have died there in 1698.

<p>The patriarch's son, <a href="majvalst.html">Martin Janse</a>, married and raised a family in the Albany hinterland.
