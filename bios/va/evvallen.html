<strong>Evert Van Allen</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">so</a>metimes "Van Alen") was born in August 1772 and baptized at the <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> Dutch church. He was the son of Abraham and Mary Van Allen but was raised and perhaps adopted by his uncle, De Freestville resident and surveyor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Van_Alen">John E. Van Allen</a> (1749-1807). He grew up in a landmark home in North Greenbush that <a href="http://www.hartgen.com/">still stands</a> today. His uncle served in the New York State Assembly and was elected to the United States Congress during the 1790s.</p>

<p>As an adult, Evert Van Allen lived in Rensselaer County as well. Taught to survey by his uncle, he was a surveyor for <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Van Rensselaer</a> Manor and was responsible for many maps across New York State. He was the <a href="../../res/achorcr.html#engineer">city engineer</a> and surveyor and made a number of historically important Albany city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#map19">maps</a>.

<p>In August of 1801, he married Schaghticoke resident Deriah Knickerbocker. At that time, he was identified as "of Greenbush." By 1825, the marriage had produced at least twelve children - none of whom settled in Albany.

<p>He did, however, occasionally buy and sell parcels of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> within the Albany city limits. 

<p>In 1811, he was captain of a cavalry unit in the New York State militia. In 1813, he was a justice of the peace in Rensselaer County.

<P>Evert Van Allen died in August 1854 and was buried in "his" De Freestville cemetery. An <a href="../../books.html#ac">obituary</a> noted he was "surveyor for [the] city, whose ancient maps proved of good service in settling lot boundaries." His will divided his Rensselaer County holdings among his children. Part of his legacy was the Blooming Grove cemetery which his will directed to remain undisturbed. He had lived eighty-two years!

<p>This sketch is presented here to provide information on an <a href="../../guide/histres.html#eva">important</a> Albany city engineer.</p>
