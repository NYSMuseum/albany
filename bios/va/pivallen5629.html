<P>According to <a href="vallen.html#sources">family</a>-based resources, <a href="../../nnd.html">New</a> Netherland pioneer <a href="#sources"><strong>Pieter Van Allen</strong></a> was born in Utrecht in 1633. He may have come to America with his father and possibly a <a href="lovallen5624.html">brother</a>.

<p>By 1660, this individual had settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he was <a href="../../res/ts.html">known</a> as a tailor and trader.  In that year, his name appeared on a <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#5629">list</a> of prominent <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a>. For a time, young <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a> was said to have been his servant.</p>

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">P</a>erhaps hh came to New Netherland with his first wife, <a href="../../res/sp.html">Weyntie Morre</a>, and their children. Additional children are said to have been born in America. His second wife was <a href="../t/mateller6616.html">Maria Teller</a>. That marriage produced children who became Albany <a href="wivallen5687.html">residents</a>.</p>

      <p>Pieter Van Allen died in January 1674 and his widow remarried. Later, the bouwery 
        he had acquired at Kinderhook in 1668 was sold to Harmen Janse by the executors 
        of his estate.</p>
