<strong>Pieter Van Allen</strong></a> was born in April 1702. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="wivallen5687.html">Willem</a> and <a href="../vp/mavpatten2129.html">Maria Van Patten</a> Van Allen. He grew up in the comfort of a businessman's home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.


<p>In April 1727, he married area native <a href="../vw/anvwie6587.html">Anna Van Wie</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She died following the birth of their third child in 1733. By 1734, he had married <a href="../vb/anvbt5401.html">Anna Van Benthuysen</a>  and was witnessing the birth of the first of their seven children.

<p>These Van Allens made their home in the first ward. In 1734, Pieter served as a constable. Three years later, he was named <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the first ward. As his father was a mariner, perhaps he was the Pieter Van Allen identified in several sources as a Hudson River skipper.

 
<p>After fathering ten children in two marriages, Pieter Van Allen died in September 1749. His <a href="jovallen5623.html">sons</a> and <a href="../l/ablyle1169.html">son-in-law</a> carried on their father's business for several decades.</p>
