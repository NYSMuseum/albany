<p>The story of the <a href="#sources"><b>Van Allen</b></a> (sometimes <a href="../../res/sp.html">Van Alen</a>) family of early Albany may begin with one Johannes Van Allen who brought his sons to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> about 1658. A younger son, <a href="pivallen5629.html">Pieter Van Allen</a> became an Albany resident but died in 1674. same-named contemporaries complicate the assignment of qualitative information for  this individual. <a href="lovallen5624.html">Lourens Van Allen</a> went on to establish the Kinderhook branch of the family. 

<p>Pieter's sons, <a href="wivallen5687.html">Willem</a> and <a href="jovallen5621.html">Johannes</a>, became Albany mainstays. In 1720, Johannes was listed among Albany freeholders. By that time six Van Allens were included among the freeholders of <a href="../../na/khook.html">K</a>inderhook and Livingston Manor. William Van Allen was listed in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#97">1756</a>, only the home of "<a href="../vb/anvbt5401.html">Mrs.Van Allen</a>" was included on a census of Albany householders.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycolumb/col-frek.htm">1763</a>, six Van Allen men were named on a list of Kinderhook freeholders.</p>

<p>In 1766, 1767, <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">1779</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>, and beyond, the Albany properties of brothers <a href="bavallen5605.html">Barent</a> and <a href="jovallen5623.html">Johannes</a>, and sometimes of their widowed mother were valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#5623">1790</a>, only one Van Allen-named household was left in the city of Albany. However, it most likely included the three adult children of the late skipper <a href="pivallen5632.html">Pieter Van Allen</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, three Van Allen named households were configured on the city census. Two were headed by widows. 

<p>By 1813, no Van Allens were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.

<p>Although not an Albany resident, city surveyor <a href="evvallen.html">Evert Van Allen</a> was responsible for a number of historically important maps made during the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Throughout the eighteenth century, the small but consistent presence of the Van Allen family in the city stood in contrast to their much more prominent occurrance in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> - particularly in the <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook area</a>.

       <a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
      resources</a>. The most useful printed resource on the family was published in the <a href="../../sources.html#nygbr"><i>NYGBR</i></a> in 1950 in two parts. It was contributed by Innes Gettys and was based on the pioneering manuscript compiled by "the late <a href="http://www.vanallengenealogy.com/VanAllen/HJVA.html">Rev. Henry John Van Allen</a>." His work seems to have been a compilation of prevailing information and <a href="../../res/ts.html">lore</a>. Scans of the seminal 1950 articles have been available on <a href="http://vanallengenealogy.com/">The Van Allen Home Page</a> as pdf files. See: <a href="http://www.vanallengenealogy.com/VanAllen/vafampt1.pdf">part I</a> and <a href="http://www.vanallengenealogy.com/VanAllen/vafampt2.pdf">part II</a>. For our purposes, most other <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based resources</a> appear to be derivative of that article.
