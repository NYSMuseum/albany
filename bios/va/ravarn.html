<strong>Rachel Van Arnhem</strong></a> was born in November 1706. She was the daughter of Albany <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">area</a> residents Jan and Hester Fonda Van Arnhem. A younger daughter in a family of six children, her father died in April 1708 when Rachel was not yet two. Perhaps her mother survived until 1753.

      <p>In December 1728, she married <a href="../w/bewinne.html">Benjamin Winne</a>. 
        By 1747, nine children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where she was an occasional baptism sponsor. In 1761, she took 
        title to a pew on the east side of the church. Four daughters married 
        Albany residents. 
      <p>These Winnes settled in the Albany hinterland. As late as <a href="../../census1790.html#bw">1790</A>, the large household of Benjamin Winney was configured on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census.

<p>Rachel Van Arnhem Winne would have been in her mid-eighties at that time.
