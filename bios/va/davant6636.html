<strong>Daniel Van Antwerpen</strong></a> was born in May 1747. He was the son of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents Gerrit and his second wife, Catharina Brouwer Van Antwerpen. This individual was known as "Daniel G." to prevent confusion with same-named kin.

<p>In December 1766, he married <a href="../w/diwinne2902.html">Dirckie Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She died after bearing two children. In October 1772, he wed thirty-four-year-old spinster <a href="../w/gewitbeck1802.html">Gerritje (Geertruy) Witbeck</a> - also in Albany. That marriage produced at least one child who was born in 1774.  Over the next decades, he had extensive dealings with the church as a supporter and regarding the payment of burial fees. 

<p>These Van Antwerpens made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> from the 1760s <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6636">on</a> detailed his moderate holdings. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6636">1790</a>, his home included five family members. 

<p>In 1767, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In 1776, a "Daniel G. Van Antwerpen" was identified as a second lieutenant in the Fifth Regiment of the Albany County militia.


<p>In 1767, he owed the city of Albany for quit rents. In 1772, he was identified as a "gentleman." 

<p>Daniel G. Van Antwerpen was last heard from in Albany in 1791. His holdings were not valued on the Albany assessment roll for 1799. Perhaps these Van Antwerpens were <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/vant_vaneps.html">living in Coeymans</a> in 1794.</p>
