<strong>Matthew Kugler</strong></a> or <a href="../../res/sp.html">Coughlear</a> probably was born before 1730. He was not born within the British empire as he was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> in New York in March 1762. Subsequent family history would point toward a German ancestry.

<p>By the 1750s, he was building a family with <a href="ankugler1161.html">Anna Stump</a> (many  <a href="../../res/sp.html">variants</a>). Their children were christened at three Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a> between 1758 and 1766. Between 1758 and 1779, he witnessed a number of baptisms at the Dutch and English churches.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home was valued moderately on the Albany assessment roll. He probably lived in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of the city.



<p>Matthew Kugler was dead by February 1782 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued to his widow. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. His son, <a href="makugler1159.html">Matthew</a>, lived in Albany for a number of years.</p>
