<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Knickerbacker</strong></a> was born in November 1735. She was the eldest daughter of <a href="woknick1530.html">Wouter</a> and <a href="../f/elfonda3816.html">Elizabeth Fonda</a> Knickerbacker. She grew up in a large family engaged primarily in agriculture in Albany and in its countryside.

<p>In December 1757, she married <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> resident <a href="../vv/covvechten2444.html">Cornelis Van Vechten</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1773, six children had been christened in Albany where she remained a pewholder well into the 1790s. Perhaps, another four babies were baptized in churches elsewhere in Albany County.

<p>These Van Vechtens appear to have started out in Albany but also held land in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manor</a>, at Schaghticoke, and also in the town of Saratoga where they ultimately made their home. 

<p>Cornelis Van Vechten was a prominent revolutionary - a colonel in the militia whose Saratoga home was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=A8YiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22van+vechten%22+saratoga&source=web&ots=lEmOsl0HUG&sig=hPMo4Z7ybuoE-jWjV_QxV9zpz_I#v=onepage&q=%22van%20vechten%22%20saratoga&f=false">burned</a> by the British in 1777. Later, he served in the State Assembly and was chosen clerk in Schaghticoke in 1794. At that <a href="../../census1790.html">time</a>, their household was configured on the <a href="http://saratoganygenweb.com/1790uvbl.htm">census</a> in Saratoga. It included seven family members and was attended by ten slaves.

<p>Anna Knickerbacker Van Vechten is <a href="http://www.walkergenealogysite.com/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I00303&tree=001">said</a> to have died at the end of December in 1809.</p>
