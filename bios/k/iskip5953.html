<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Kip</strong></a> was born in November 1688. He was the first child born to the marriage of Albany newcomers <a href="abkip5942.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../vd/geesvdh5687.html">Geesie Vanderheyden</a> Kip. He grew up in a trader's home on Albany's <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. 

<p>He appears to have been a life-long bachelor. He was a member, pewholder, and regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Isaac came of age at the start of three decades of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> and appears to have become a frontier extension of his father's business. Thus, he was frequently away from Albany - sometimes at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. Appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> in 1713, he was fined at least twice for ignoring his duties. He did, however, <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">belong</a> to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company and was counted among the second ward freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5953">1720</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2">1742</a>, and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5953">1763</a>.

<p>His father died in 1731 and he probably continued to live with his mother 
        who survived until 1748. As he was the only living son, a considerable 
        family estate, including land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>, 
        came under his control. By <a href="../../census1756.html#18">1756</a>, 
        he was in his late sixties and ensconced in the family home where he was 
        identified by the British army as "Mr. Tripp" the "Indian <a href="../../furtrade.html">Trader</a>." 
        He remained a contractor of the Albany government and managed his property 
        which included a bolting house. His home and holdings were serviced by 
        a number of <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#slave">slaves</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1762">1762</a>, he still was considered 
        an active trader. However, by <a href="../../lists/list1764.html">1764</a>, 
        his name no longer appeared on petitions submitted by Albany-based fur 
        traders. 
      <p>Isaac Kip filed a <a href="../../wills/williskip.html">will</a> in February 
        1765. He died before it passed probate on October 29, 1771. Except for 
        the illusive <a href="bekip.html">Benjamin Kip</a>, with Isaac's passing 
        the Kip family name dropped from Albany annals!</p>
