<P>Eventual Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Kirkland</strong></a> probably was born during the 1730s.

<p>His wife was <a href="mgtkirkland.html">Margaret</a>. They are <a href="http://listsearches.rootsweb.com/th/read/KIRKLAND/2005-01/1104675413">said</a> to have had at least two sons - one born in Scotland and the other at sea while the parents were enroute to America in 1759.

<p>He (or perhaps his son and namesake) is <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924025959135/cu31924025959135_djvu.txt">said</a> to have been among the Scottish immigrants who first settled what became the town of New Scotland.

<p>Perhaps he was the William Kirkland whose name <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_1st_reg.htm">appeared</a> as an enlisted man on the roster of the First Regiment of the New York Line.

<p>He first appeared in the Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a> in July 1786 when his bill to the city was paid in bushels of wheat. In October 1787, he <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/collectionsonhis02muns/collectionsonhis02muns_djvu.txt">sued</a> Alderman <a href="../y/pwyates.html">Peter W. Yates</a> (representing the city government) for payment of a debt owed him by the city and won a judgment of over six pounds. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wmk">1788</a>, his first ward house and property were valued on the city assessment roll. Two years later, the census showed that his Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#wmk">household</a> consisted of him and three females. In 1799, his house and lot and property were valued modestly. In <a href="../../census1800.html#wmk">1800</a>, his household again was listed near the top of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> census and included an older couple and two younger women.

<p>In 1792, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>William Kirkland was dead by April 8, 1803 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">Letters</a> of Administration issued on his estate <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyalbany/g-m.htm">identified</a> him as a mason and named his two sons. His widow <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22kirkland+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22kirkland%20widow%22&f=false">lived</a> on in Albany for more than a decade.</p>
