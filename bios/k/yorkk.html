<P><p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#yk">1790</a>, the census for the city of Albany enumerated the household of "York Kilburn." Living in his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home were three "<a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free people of color</a>." Also appearing on that census was the first ward <a href="../../census1790.html#ck">household</a> of Charles Kilburn which included neither free blacks nor slaves.

<p>It appears that <a href="#sources"> <strong>York Kilburn</strong></a> was born in 1753. Military <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/massachusettssolklsumass#page/184/mode/2up/search/kilburn">service records</a> also reveal that he was 5' 4'', had black hair and skin, and was a painter.

<p>A <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional source has listed him among the Revolutionary war soldiers from Great Barrington (Berkshire County, Massachusetts)  and noted that he was a "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_qbAR2WAAVsC&pg=PA194&lpg=PA194&dq=%22york+kilburn%22&source=bl&ots=ZRWAbFq-Dt&sig=vTjl9Mf7KJs-dG3lL0587ArGg34&hl=en&ei=j7_STNzmLIXGlQezqo3oDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&q=%22york%20kilburn%22&f=false">negro</a>." At the same time, a York Kilburn and other same-surnamed soldiers were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_qbAR2WAAVsC&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205&dq=%22york+kilburn%22&source=bl&ots=ZRWAbFq-Dt&sig=vTjl9Mf7KJs-dG3lL0587ArGg34&hl=en&ei=j7_STNzmLIXGlQezqo3oDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&q=%22york%20kilburn%22&f=false">listed</a> from the town of Sandsfield.  A clothing and payroll <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:up1VeZCBudkJ:www.gilderlehrman.org/institute/ar_07.pdf+%22york+kilburn%22&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShL1dCHBDLCUh7o83Yx-evCXxerVW0SKYPt4D2wPZGHC4-D7UfZLfCl1XR4SPoMH9QQplWkvkPN9hpg-o4R4phrwDbkTKMLPy5hheg9epqWvG7enZWH8TELwWsl5WmwpkGCVM3J&sig=AHIEtbTeH0TVmL2illmGNLjsAWU5AU7hIA">list</a> for the First Massachusetts Regiment from 1781 to 1783 included the name of "York Kilburn" along with a number of other <a href="#aa">African American</a> soldiers. His name has not been encountered among the wartime records consulted <a href="../../inprog.html">so far</a> for Albany or for greater New York State.  
 
<p><a href="../qqqq.html">After</a> the end of the war, he became a resident of Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#yk">1788</a>, his house and holdings were valued modestly on the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> Albany assessment. Two years later, his household was included on the <a href="../../census1790.html#yk">census</a>. Four entries below, was the Market Street <a href="../../census1790.html#yk">home</a> of General <a href="../t/abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a>, which included twelve slaves.

<p>However, in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the Albany assessment roll valued only the small lot of "York Kilborne" with dozens of others in the first ward. After that, his name drops from Albany rolls. 

<p>York Kilburn is said to have moved on to New York City where he was identified as a free black head of household on the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=4y41KAacPFUC&pg=PA156&lpg=PA156&dq=%22york+kilburn%22+1800&source=bl&ots=jSIbiw-Em8&sig=rS1kGZcTTU9PKmbFfuxhp2oNG4Q&hl=en&ei=q6raTIL3FsX7lwe-yJW8Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22york%20kilburn%22%201800&f=false">census</a> of the fourth ward in 1800.

<p>Later, "free black" York Kilburn was living in the town of Union in Broome County where he was identified as a householder on the census in 1820 and again in 1830.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his life <a href="../../res/origins.html">before</a> and after Albany.</p>
