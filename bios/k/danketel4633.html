      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Daniel Ketelhuyn</b></a> probably was born about 1670. 
        He was the son of <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> <a href="joketel4639.html">Jochem</a> 
        and <a href="../w/anwillems4626.html">Anna Willems</a> Ketelhuyn. His 
        parents were pioneer settlers of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. 
        Daniel grew up in Albany where, by the mid-1690s, his widowed mother was 
        the <a href="../../census1697.html#074">head</a> of their riverside home.</p>


<p>In August 1695, he married <a href="../v/deviele6781.html">Debora Viele</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1722, their ten children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>These Ketelhuyns set up their <a href="../../census1697.html#171">home</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where he owned several additional parcels of land. He was a trader/merchant who included the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> of Albany among his customers. During the first decade of the eighteenth century, he was a constable, collector, and assistant alderman in the third ward. He served as an officer in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and was involved in the expedition to conquer Canada in 1711. Sometimes, he was referred to as "Lieutenant Daniel Ketelhuyn." In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4633">1699</a>, he joined with his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. City assessment rolls <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4633">taxed</a> his holdings at a modest rate.</p>

<p>In 1708, he began to purchase (lease) lands on Albany's property at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. He seems to have moved there by 1711. In October of that year, his wife and children were kidnapped by French and Indian raiders. After securing their return, he re-settled his family in another part of Schaghticoke. Despite those difficulties,  over the years, he augmented his holdings in the Hoosick Valley. 

<p>Daniel Ketelhuyn was dead by November 1731 when letters of administration were issued to his son-in-law. By that time, the Ketelhuyn name had passed from Albany rolls.</p>
