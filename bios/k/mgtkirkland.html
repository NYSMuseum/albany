<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Margaret Kirkland</strong></a> was the wife of Albany resident <a href="wmkirkland.html">William Kirkland</a>.

<p>Margaret probably was born in Scotland during the 1730s or 40s and came to New York with her husband and at least one son in 1759. She is said to have given birth to another son during the voyage.

<p>Her husband was said to have been among the founders of the town of New Scotland. 

<p>We seek information on her life particularly during the War for Independence where her husband served in the American army.

<p>By the late 1780s, these Kirklands were <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wmk">living</a> in the first ward of Albany. In <a href="../../census1790.html#wmk">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html#wmk">1800</a>, their household was configured on the Albany census.

<p>William Kirkland was dead by 1803 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on his estate.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, Margaret Kirkland was counted as the head of her Albany household. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22kirkland+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22kirkland%20widow%22&f=false">1813</a>, her residence at 44 Union Street was included in the first city directory. Subsequent directories fixed her address at 108 Beaver Street.
 
<p>By 1818, the name of Margaret Kirkland had dropped from Albany rolls.</p>
