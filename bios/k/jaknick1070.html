<strong>Jannetie Knickerbocker</strong></a> was born before 1683. She was the daughter of Albany area residents Harmen and Elizabeth Bogert Knickerbacker.

<p>In March 1704, she married <a href="../l/helansing3390.html">Hendrick Lansing, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, she was said to be "born and living in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. Their daughter was born in August 1705. In March 1709, she was identified as the widow of Hendrick Lansing and currently a resident of Albany when she married Albany native <a href="../b/anbogardus6358.html">Anthony Bogardus</a>. By 1721, that marriage had produced seven children who also were christened in the Albany church where she was a regular baptism sponsor - as late as 1748.

<p>This Bogardus family lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> but seemed to make only a faint impression on the community record before Anthony Bogardus's death in 1744. Jannetie may have been the "Widow Bogardus" identified as a "farmer" and listed on a census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html#102">1756</a>.

<p>Jannetie Knickerbocker Lansing Bogardus was <a href="../../dead.html#drc">buried</a> from the Albany church in November 1759.</p>
