<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Amelia Kip</strong></a> was born in August 1746. She was the daughter of Abraham <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EtMUAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA2-PA71&lpg=RA2-PA71&dq=%22abraham+kip%22+pruyn&source=bl&ots=RvRzSi4Rhj&sig=QimWWfi6Avv-jCABoqh6Hwc7nug&hl=en&ei=CILuTJLJCsL48Abp3634Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20kip%22%20pruyn&f=false">and</a> Albany native Elsie Pruyn Kip. She was the only daughter of a small family and grew up in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kYktB96BLdgC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=%22abraham+kip%22+rhinebeck&source=bl&ots=HahQrv3ldQ&sig=NYzLixoKctghG2WK_6k4_xdZAew&hl=en&ei=JD7pTIfJFYK0lQeX3eWnCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20kip%22%20rhinebeck&f=false">landmark</a> home of a prosperous Dutchess County agri-businessman. Amelia Kip was granddaughter of <a href="../s/amsanders1420.html">Am</a>elia Sanders Pruyn.


<p>In November 1755, this nine-year-old was named in her ailing father's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5RsXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA99&dq=%22abraham+kip&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20kip&f=false">will</a>. Following his death (which occurred within a few months), she was to receive a share of his substantial estate and was to be raised in the Albany home of her mother's brother, <a href="../p/jopruyn3556.html">John Pruyn, Jr.</a> Her mother was not referred to in Abraham Kip's will.

<p>We presently presume that Amelia did grow up in the household of her Albany uncle. In February 1786, she was named as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjopruyn3556.html">will</a> filed by the abovementioned John Pruyn.

<p>By that time, she had married Albany newcomer <a href="../w/stwynan6949.html">Stephen Wynants</a>. Their marriage produced a number of children - although none of them appear to have been baptized in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Pruyn was dead by January 1788 and perhaps Amelia and her husband were able to stay on in his Albany home. 

<p>The couple raised their family in a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6949">house</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1790, the census showed their <a href="../../census1790.html#6949">household</a> included five people. After that, Stephen Wynants appears to have left Albany.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Amelia Kip Wynants.</p>
