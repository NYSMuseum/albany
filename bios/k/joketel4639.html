      <P><A href="#sources"><B>Jochem Ketelhuyn</B></A> came to New Netherland in 1642. 
        In 1649, he was a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        tenant - farming on Papsknee Island.</p>

      <p>By the mid-1650s, he had become a householder in the new village of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#4639">1660</a>, he was counted among 
        the community's <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a>.</P>

      <P>He married <a href="../w/anwillems4626.html">Anna Willems</a> and began 
        a <a href="ketel.html">family</a> that included several sons and daughters 
        who became Albany residents. Settling in Albany, he bought, sold, and 
        rented property and was a litigant before the Albany court. In 1679, he 
        was identified as a marginal <a href="../../census1679.html#4639">Albany 
        householder</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#4639">1684</a>, 
        his Albany taxes were overdue and he was ordered to appear and pay. His 
        home was on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
        Street</a> near Maiden Lane.</P>



<p>Patriarch of the family in America, Jochem Ketelhuyn died between 1684 and 1685. His widow and three sons were Albany householders in <a href="../../census1697.html#074"></a>1697.</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Jochem Ketelhuyn is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 4639. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="ketel.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. These sources 
        state that he was the son of attorney and officeholder Jochem Ketel and 
        Margarita Wessels and that he "left Mechlenburg during the Thirty Years 
        War and drifted to Amsterdam!" He probably was born during the first decades 
        of the seventeenth century! </font></p>
