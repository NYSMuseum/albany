<P><b>T</b>he story of the <a href="#sources"> <strong>Kidney</strong></a> family in early Albany begins with the arrival of <a href="jokid5976.html">John Kidney</a> from Barbadoes in the 1690s. His marriage to Albany native <a href="../vd/mavdw6678.html">Maria Vanderwerken</a> produced four sons and established the family in Albany and its hinterland. The Kidneys maintained a constant if marginal presence in the commuity over several generations.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, only the elder <a href="jokid5976.html">John Kidney</a> was included on a list of Albany freeholders.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, three Kidneys (John, <a href="rokid5999.html">Roelof</a>, and Jacobus) were included on a list 
        of freeholders in Albany and Rensselaerswyck. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, the households of cooper 
        <a href="rokid5999.html">Ralf Kidney</a> and slooper <a href="../../census1756.html#205">John 
        Kidney</a> were listed on the census taken by the British army. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a>, the names of three 
        Kidneys (John and John Jr.) were included on a list of Albany freeholders. 
      <p>In <a href="../../coerec1771.html#kid">1771</a>, the names of "Mrs. Kidney 
        & son" appeared on a list of communicants of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Anglican church. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, no Kidney-named households 
        were listed on the Albany census but a "Roeloff Kidney" was living in 
        Catskill. Additional households were <a href="http://www.beekmansettlers.com/index.html">established</a> 
        in Dutchess County. 
      <p>The first city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a> in 1813 
        listed John Kidney and Revolutionary War soldier <a href="jokid5989.html">Jonathan 
        Kidney</a> as blacksmiths living on Hudson Street - not far from where 
        the first Kidney made his home more than a century earlier. </p>
