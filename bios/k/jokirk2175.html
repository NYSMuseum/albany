      <P>According to subsequent information, <a href="#sources"><b>John Kirk</b></a> 
        was born about 1747. He probably was of Scottish ancestry.</p>
      <p>He was a merchant and among the many newcomers who settled in Albany 
        after the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Revolutionary war</a>.</p>
      <p>His wife was Isabel or Mabel [maiden name unknown at this time]. A number 
        of their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian 
        church</a> beginning in 1786. In 1802, he was named one of the first trustees 
        of the <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">United Presbyterian church</a>. 
        He also was an officer in the Albany St. Andrews Society.</p>
		
<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2175">1788</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">third ward</a> home was valued on the Albany assessment roll. In 1790, his houshold was configured 
        on the <a href="../../census1790.html#2175">census</a>. His holdings on 
        Market Street included a lot and shop. He also owned lots in the first 
        ward. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2175">1800</a>, his household 
        included five children. City directories later <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22kirk+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22kirk%20john%22&f=false">identified</a> 
        him as a merchant and gave his address as 37 <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia 
        Street</a>.</p>
      <p>John Kirk died in March 1826 at the age of seventy-nine. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed 
        probate later in the month. </p>
