<P>According to family-based resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Kidney</strong></a> may have been <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jankidney/index.html">born</a> in 1712. He was the youngest son of <a href="jokid5976.html">John</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdw6678.html">Maria Vanderwerken</a> Kidney. By mid-century, Jacob and three brothers also would establish <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside Albany households joining their widowed mother who survived perhaps until 1760.

<p>In October 1737, Jacob married Schoharie resident <a href="../h/anhag8292.html">Anna Hagadorn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1742, three children had been christened in Albany. Family-based resources tell us that they had six total children. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1739">1739</a>, he was named a firemaster for the first ward.

<p>In 1741, he paid more than ten pounds for land in the first ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5984">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of freeholders in the first ward.

<p>After that, the name of Jacob Kidney drops off the community-based roll. Perhaps, this Kidney family <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=AHN&db=vanalstine&id=I06631">re-located</a> to New Jersey where their younger children <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jankidney/index.html">appear</a> to have been born. We suspect he has been confused with a younger, same-named  <a href="jakid5985.html">nephew</a> who was born in 1735.</p>
