<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Jo</a>hannes or <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hans Kierstede</strong></a> was a physician in <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and then New York. He has been the <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22hans+kierstede%22">subject</a> of substantial historical inquiry and <a href="../../res/ts.html">ex</a>position.  However, most of his life unfolded <a href="../../na/na.html">beyond</a> the early Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>. He is said to have been born about 1612 and to have arrived in New Amsterdam in 1638 as an employee of the West India Company. Perhaps he was of <a href="../ger.html">Ger</a>man ancestry.

<p>In June 1642, he married <a href="../j/sajans.html">Sara Jans</a> at the Dutch church in New Amsterdam. His wife was the daughter of one of the pre-eminenent New Netherland matriarchs.Over the next twenty-five years, the marriage produced perhaps ten children. Descendants (including Albany resident Dr. <a href="../m/wilman.html">Wilhelmus Mancius</a>) became physicians, apothecaries, and silversmiths (including Albany resident <a href="../t/cote4812.html">Coenradt Ten Eyck</a>).

<p>He is <a href="https://archive.org/stream/cu31924080795127#page/n377/mode/2up">said</a> to have owned a lot in Beverwyck in 1653. His name also appeared in the Beverwyck <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">court</a> records during that time.  

<p>He is <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/kestedfamilywebsite/kestedhistory">said</a> to have been the first surgeon in New Amsterdam where he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5SI_AAAAQBAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22hans+kierstede%22&source=bl&ots=S1RxpFqeo-&sig=kuxfVviSSIVgGS727vAECCv5WlU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=U0SDVJqLJK3fsAS5lYKACQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22hans%20kierstede%22&f=false">resided</a> until his death. He <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=samsloan&id=I9846">performed</a> a coroner's inquest in 1638. Many <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditions persist regarding his life and times. He is much <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=samsloan&id=I9846">est</a>eemed by heritage organizations. 

<p>He was listed among those residents of New Netherland who <a href="../../nat.html#1664">swore allegiance</a> to England in 1664.

<p>Dr. Hans Kierstede was dead by July 1667 when he was referenced in a real property transaction. His widow remarried twice and lived until 1693.

<p>Our sweep of community and <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based</a> resources yield no stronger connection for this New Netherland pioneer to the early Albany community. Thus, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.
