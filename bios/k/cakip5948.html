<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina/Tryntie Kip</b></a> probably was born in 1656 and baptized in the New Amsterdam Dutch Reformed church. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer Isaac Kip and his first wife, Catharina Hendricks Snyder. She grew up on Manhattan Island.</p>


<p>In January 1676, she married <a href="../d/phdef4706.html">Philip De Foreest</a> at the New York City Dutch Reformed church. Their first daughter was baptized in New York. But by 1703, eight more of her children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Reformed church</a> where she was a member.</p>

<p>By 1680, these Kips had relocated to Albany where they were <a href="../../census1697.html#137">mainstays</a> for several decades. By 1720, Philip De Foreest was identified as a freeholder in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. He died in 1723.</p> 

<p>Catharina Kip De Foreest was buried in August 1731.</p>
