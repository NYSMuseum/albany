<strong>Abraham Kip</strong></a> proably was born about 1659. He was the son of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> Isaac and Catharina Hendricks Kip. He grew up in New Amsterdam and its environs. </p>

<p>In October 1687, he married Albany native <a href="../vd/geesvdh5687.html">Geesie Vanderheyden</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The couple settled in Albany. By 1705, their eight children had been christened at the Albany church where both parents were active members.

<p>For many decades, these Kips were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#107">mainstays</a>. His house was on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> at Maiden Lane and he also owned additional property in the first ward. His holdings were <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5942">assessed</a> comparable to those of a moderately affluent  merchant. He served as juror, assessor, surveyor, firemaster, and constable but was not elected to the city council. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5942">1699</a>, he joined with his Albany neighbors in pledging allegiance to the king of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5942">1720</a>, he was identified as an Albany freeholder.


<p>Abraham Kip died in June 1731. His widow lived on until 1748.</p>
