<strong>Johannes Kidney</strong></a> was born in July 1704. He was the son of <a href="jokid5976.html">John</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdw6678.html">Maria Vanderwerken</a> Kidney. Son of a former <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> soldier, he grew up among an Anglo enclave on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany.

<p>His adult life in the community began in August 1730 when he purchased a lot on the "plain." In that year, his lot was on the north side of Hudson Street and east of what became <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl</a> - a location that stayed in the family for the rest of the century.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1740">1740</a>, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the first ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5986">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of first ward freeholders.

<p>In 1729, he is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jankidney/35.html">said</a> to have married his cousin Geertruy Vanderwerken. Their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1736 and 1747.

<p>After the 1740s, a number of contemporary individuals named John Kidney <a href="../../census1756.html#205">living in</a> and around Albany complicate further reconstructing this individual's life.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a>, two John Kidneys are included on the list of Albany freeholders.


<p>We seek defining information on the later life and passing of this early  Albany resident named Johannes Kidney.</P>
