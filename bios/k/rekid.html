<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rebecca Kidney</strong></a> was born in May 1723. She was an older daughter of <a href="rokid5999.html">Roeloff</a> and <a href="../b/engburger.html">Engeltie Burger</a> Kidney. She grew up in a very large family on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany where her father practiced the cooper's trade. "Ralf Kitnie" lived well into her adulthood as did a number of her siblings.

<p>In April 1743 and July 1744, Rebecca "Kitnie" was still single when she witnessed christenings at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Probably during the late 1740s, she married newcomer <a href="../e/jaell7941.html">James Elliot</a>. It appears that their marriage produced <a href="../../children.html">children</a>. We have not documented christenings for these parents in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, it appears that their daughter was <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jankidney/93.html">baptized</a> in Dutchess County in November 1747.

<p>These Elliots lived on what became <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a> from where James would be known as the city marshall. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7941">1790</a>, only one other person (female) was listed on the census of their first ward household. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#7941">later</a>, her household included only one young boy.

<p>Rebecca Kidney Elliot died in February 1809 and was buried from the Dutch church. This Albany native had <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=%22rebecca+kidney%22+1809&source=bl&ots=Sq9xPHyiyn&sig=7oU1LtQTAQtNia7Jh61_pwB4CAE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LmJoUIG1C5PH0AHitIHYCA&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22rebecca%20kidney%22%201809&f=false">lived</a> 85 years, 9 months and 13 days. Her epitaph elicited the comment "She died in hope of a glorious resurrection" in the church records. Her onetime newcomer husband survived until 1816.</p>
