<P><a href="#sources"><b>Roeloff Kidney</b></a> was born in June 1700. He was the son of former soldier <a href="jokid5976.html">Jan</a> and and his wife, Albany native <a href="../vd/mavdw6678.html">Maria Vanderwerken</a> Kidney. He grew up with three brothers in a <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> neighborhood of soldiers and other post-New Netherland <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> that broadened Albany's demographic base during the first decades of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In June 1721, he married <a href="../b/engburger.html">Engeltie Burger</a>. By 1748, their thirteen children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>These Kidneys also lived in the first ward - in a modest home on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> near the fort. Roeloff or "Ralph" practiced the <a href="../../census1756.html#190">cooper's trade</a>. In his younger days, he also ran errands to places like New York and <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. He held additional lots on Albany's Southside. In 1737, he was left a cash <a href="../../wills/willjrosie.html">bequest</a> by his neighbor Jan Rosie to purchase a lot of land.</p>

<p>The name of this Albany mainstay appeared on community rolls throughout the mid-eighteenth century - lastly on a freeholder's list dated <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5999">1763</a>. He probably died before the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>.</p>
