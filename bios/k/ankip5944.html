<strong>Anna Kip</strong></a> was born in May 1694. She was the daughter of Albany newcomers <a href="abkip5942.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../vd/geesvdh5687.html">Geesie Vanderheyden</a> Kip. She grew up in a merchant's home on Pearl Street.

<p>In November 1716, Anna married Albany native <a href="../w/jowendell2945.html">Johannes E. Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1735, eight children had been christened at the Albany church.

<p>These Wendells also made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Johannes was an emerging businessman and Albany official. That rise ended with Wendell's death in December 1739 leaving the forty-five-year-old Anna to raise a family and maintain their assets.

<p>Although she was named as the owner of second ward property on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> during the 1760s, she may have lived with her adult <a href="../w/evwendell2663.html">son</a> who would have been considered as the head of the household in <a href="../../census1756.html#79">1756</a>.

<p>In April 1763, she was named sole heir and executor of the <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2663.html">will</a> of her son, <a href="../w/evwendell2663.html">Evert</a> - who died just a month later.

<p>Anna Kip Wendell filed a will in March 1774. It named her fifty-five-year-old maiden <a href="../w/geewendell2872.html">daughter</a> as her executor. She died in September 1779. Earlier in that year, her holdings were valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">assessment rolls</a> - making her one of the city's seventy-one <a href="../../or/or-bh.html#1779">women-headed</a> households. Widow Anna had lived eighty-three years - the last forty as a widow.</p>
