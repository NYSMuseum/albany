 <P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, the <A href="#sources"><B>Ketelhuyn family</B></A> of early Albany traces its roots to from <a href="joketel4639.html">Jochem Ketelhuyn</a> who is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have emigrated to America in 1642. A native of <a href="../ger.html">Germany</a>, he had been recruited for <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>, settled on <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, and later established a home in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. He is said to have died in Albany in 1682.</P>

      <p>He married <a href="../w/anwillems4626.html">Anna Willems</a>. His widow 
        and three sons were identified as householders on the <a href="../../census1697.html">Albany 
        census</a> in 1697. One son, <a href="danketel4633.html">Daniel</a>, became 
        an early settler of <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. His 
        brother, one-time Albany resident <a href="davketel4634.html">David Ketelhuyn</a>, 
        was killed by raiders on Daniel's farm in 1711. After 1713, Jochem's third 
        son, <a href="wmketel4652.html">Willem Ketelhuyn</a>, moved from Albany 
        to Saratoga and died there in 1746.</p>

      <p>With the death of Jochem's children, the Ketelhuyn name passed from Albany 
        rolls but remained prominent in the outer reaches of <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a> - particularly at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>!.</p>
