      <P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Daniel 
        Kelly</strong></a> lived in Albany during the first decades of the eighteenth 
        century. He may have been a former <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison 
        soldier</a> but that connection has not yet been made. However, he served 
        in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. Obviously, 
        we suspect that he was of <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> ancestry but 
        seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. 
      <p>In July 1704, the city council <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">agreed</a> 
        with him to quarter ten soldiers in his house at three shillings and nine 
        pence each per week. The next year, he was among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=daniell+kelly&source=bl&ots=2hQsH0Wu8v&sig=4lD0C0XQmnOdYuxMcStv5XnGIGE&hl=en&ei=FJgDTZmEBoL_8Abz5YjnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=daniell%20kelly5&f=false">fined</a> 
        fifteen shillings for not paving in front of his house. 
      <p>Between 1708 and 1716, he witnessed several baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. One of his partners was "Margariet Killy" - perhaps referring 
        to his wife. However, no children were christened by them in any of Albany's 
        <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#dk">1709</a>, his first ward 
        property was valued on the city assessment roll. A number of his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> 
        neighbors were former soldiers. 
<p>In 1711, he gave up some of his land for the "<a href="#queen">Queen's Highway</a>" by moving his fence. 
      <p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pPA5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA456&lpg=PA456&dq=%22daniel+kelly%22+%22james+irish%22&source=bl&ots=rM7szqHmof&sig=_90GqdrtDzfHviLQGZqeRuWNm8U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CUjBU_2nEIP0oASQnICwAg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22daniel%20kelly%22%20%22james%20irish%22&f=false">1714</a>, he was identified as a private in Peter Matthew's company of the Albany militia which included a number of Anglo Albany residents. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#dk">1720</a>, his name was included 
        on a list of freeholders in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
      <p>After that, the name of Daniel Kelly has not been encountered in the 
        Albany record. We <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now seeking 
        information on his later life and passing.</p>
