      <P><A href="#sources"><B>Willem Ketelhuyn</B></A> was the son of <a href="joketel4639.html">Jochem</a> 
        and <a href="../w/anwillems4626.html">Anna Willems</a> Ketelhuyn. He 
        probably was born during the 1650s.</P>

<P>About 1680, He married young widow <a href="../../bios/l/hilansing3400.html">Hilletie Lansing Vanderzee</a>. She brought several Vanderzee children to the marriage which produced at least three more children. Over the next half century, he was a supporter and regular sponsor for baptisms at the Albany Dutch church.</P>

<p>Formerly a <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">farmer</a> in the employ of Marte Gerritse, William Jochemse took over management of the tavern Hilletie inherited from her late husband. Over the next two decades, their household was described on <a href="../../census1697.html#015">censuses</a> and he was identified as an Albany mainstay. His tavern was located on the southside at the intersection of Beaver and Green streets.In 1700, it was used as lodging for <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> officers and their wives.</p> 

<p>During the 1680s, Ketelhuyn purchased land north of Rensselaerswyck and east of the Hudson. That property became his farm. In 1713, following the death of Hilletie and his re-marriage to Maria De Ridder, he moved north to his farm. In 1720, he was identified as a freeholder of Rensselaerswyck. In 1734, he filed a will that stated he was a resident of Saratoga and the husband of Maria.</p>

<p>Willem Ketelhuyn died in August 1746 and was buried in the cemetery of the Albany Dutch church.</p>
