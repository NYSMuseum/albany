      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Ketelhuyn</b></a> probably was born during the 
        1670s. She was the daughter of Albany fur trader <a href="joketel4639.html">Jochem</a> 
        and <a href="../w/anwillems4626.html">Anna Willems</a> Ketelhuyn.</p>


<p>In May 1693, she married <a href="../b/jobradt4253.html">Johannes Barentse Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1709, nine children were christened at the Albany church where both parents were members and occasional baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Bradts set up their home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> and became Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#062">mainstays</a>. Johannes was a trader who was able to acquire land at Schaghticoke where he sought to develop a farm.</p>

<p>The Bradts were living at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> in October 1711 when an <a href="http://bobmurg.home.att.net/massacre_at_schaghticoke.htm">incident</a> with a group of Indians resulted in the death of Johannes Bradt, members of their household, and the capture of Maria and other women. She was taken to Canada and returned home following an exchange in January 1712.</p>

<p>Following the death of her husband, Maria seems to have taken an interest in rehabilitating his Tomhannock holdings - receiving additional acreage there in 1718 and negotiating with her Albany government landlords regarding her yearly rent in 1726.</p>

<p>Maria Ketelhuyn Bradt was alive in July 1736 and trying to sell Johannes Bradt's farm! <a href="../../res/ts.html">T</a>raditional <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyhamilt/bios/bradt.html">sources</a> fix her death in October 1754. </p>
