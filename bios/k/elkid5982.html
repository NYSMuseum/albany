<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Kidney</b></a> was born in April 1748. She was the daughter of <a href="rokid5999.html">Roeloff</a> and <a href="../b/engburger.html">Engeltie Burger</a> Kidney. She grew up in a large family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where her father practiced the cooper's trade and provided varied services at and for the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>. </p>


<p>By 1775, she had become the wife of jailer <a href="../b/stbell.html">Stephen Bell</a>. Over the next five years, two of her sons were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1815, she was a widow when she joined the Second Reformed church in Albany.</p>

<p>The censuses of <a href="../../census1790.html#950">1790</a> and 1800 showed Stephen Bell's household as residing in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. In 1800, husband and wife were alone in their home located just north of the "<a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a>"- probably along North <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>.</p>

<p>In 1801 and 1802, she was called "Widow Bell" and received support from the Dutch church and the city <a href="../../poor.html#5982">government</a>.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Kidney Bell died in February 1828 at the age of eighty. Her funeral proceeded from the house of John Mendon at 91 North Market.</p>
