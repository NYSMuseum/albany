<strong>Benjamin Kip</strong></a> was born during the first half of the eighteenth century. His baptism was not included in the extant records of early Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, a number of "Benjamin Kips" (Benjamin Kipp) are connected to the former <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> family that maintained a presence in New York, on Long Island, and in Dutchess County - as well as in Albany during the eighteenth century. He was not mentioned in the will filed by the childless Albany merchant <a href="iskip5953.html">Isaac Kip</a> in 1765. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#bk">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. However, his name was not included on any of the survey records <a href="../../sources.html#uny">encountered</a> for that time period.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1779">1779</a>, he was named constable for the third ward.

<p>Perhaps he was the Benjamin Kip whose household was configured in Rhinebeck on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> in 1790. A number of Kip-named households appeared on that document in the Dutchess County town. 

<p>Benjamin Kip probably died just after 1800. His will passed probate in August 1802. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> defining information on this sometimes Albany resident's origins, family life, and passing!</p>
