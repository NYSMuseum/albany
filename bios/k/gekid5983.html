<P><a href="#sources"><b>Geertruy Kidney</b></a> was baptized at the Albany Dutch church in January 1731. She was the daughter of first ward residents Roeloff and Engeltie Burger Kidney.</p>


<p>By 1755, she had become the wife of hatter and businessman <a href="../m/wmmcin1114.html">William Mc Intosh</a>. Over the next two decades at least five children were baptized in Albany churches.</p>

<p>Apparently Mc Intosh was away from home during the latter stages of the war as she was the housholder of record in several dealings with the city in 1780 and 81.

<p>She (William Mc Intosh's wife) may have been buried from the Albany Dutch church in April 1785. But could she be the Gertrude Mc Intosh who was listed on the <a href="../../poor.html">city poor list</a> in 1799?</p>
