      <P>According to subsequent <a href="../../dead.html#relocate">burial</a> 
        information, <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Kane</strong></a> would 
        seem to have been born about 1732. He does not seem to be related to <a href="jakane.html">James 
        Kane</a> or to the other <a href="../../res/sp.html">K</a>anes who lived 
        in eighteenth-century Albany. 
      <p>In August 1765, he first posted an administrative <a href="../../guide/histres.html#later">bond</a>. 
        At that time, he was identifed as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html">mer</a>chant 
        of Albany. 
      <p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his (William <a href="../../res/sp.html">C</a>aine) 
        house and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> 
        were accorded assessments comparable to the city's leading merchants. 
      <p>He was a storekeeper in Albany. His <a href="#book">account books</a> 
        from 1760-1771 and from 1764-1792 detailed business transactions. 
      <p>In April 1766, he (Cain) was among those partners applying to purchase 
        a tract of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> from the Catskill 
        Indians. In October 1771, he was one of fifty-five men who were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AuRKAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA3-PA36&lpg=RA3-PA36&dq=%22william+kane%22+albany&source=bl&ots=WpO-Rnqp4w&sig=h7YBM7QAqXNjtdtbJNnLy-kiZBA&hl=en&ei=G-5RS-meCZK1tgem462tDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=%22william%20kane%22%20albany&f=false">granted</a> 
        a royal <a href="../../res/realestate.html">p</a>atent for a tract of 
        50,000 acres located south of the Mohawk. 
      <p>His wife was <a href="../d/eldox551.html">Elizabeth Dox</a>. The marriage 
        produced a number of children, one of whom was christened in the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> early in 1778. Although, his 
        family was <a href="../../dead.html#relocate">interred</a> in the Dutch 
        church cemetery plot, Kane himself was a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
        church. 
      <p>In March 1776, he began seeking permission from the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> 
        to be able to <a href="../../furtrade.html">tr</a>ade with the Indians 
        as "the greatest part of his property was out there and that he would 
        suffer greatly if not permitted to go." The Committee was moved and he 
        was permitted to trade at that time. A year later, he was identified as 
        one of those who was "suspicious and dangerous" and was scheduled to be 
        incarcerated at the fleet prison at Kingston. He was able, however, to 
        persuade the Committee not to send him away and did take the oath. After 
        the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> 
        in conjunction with the <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_levies_albany.htm">Third</a> 
        or Watervliet Militia regiment. 
      <p>In <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#2529">1788</a>, he owed more 
        than two pounds to the late Dr. Henry Van Dyck. His account books detailed 
        Kane's business around Albany from the 1760s into the 1790s. 
		
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2529">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html#2529">1800</a>, 
        his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. 
        A number of slaves also were included under his household. His Watervliet neighbors were his mother's family, the <a href= "../m/marselis.html">Marselises</a>.
		
<p>William Kane lost his wife in 1793. She was buried from the Albany Dutch church.
      <p>The first Watervliet town meeting in 1809 was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA929&lpg=PA929&dq=%22william+kane%22+watervliet&source=bl&ots=m0fYUBfMiQ&sig=IRLMvIWTWuIGVCuUyXQUuE4aBpk&hl=en&ei=nudRS6HMJJWOlAflrNWgCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20kane%22%20watervliet&f=false">said</a> 
        to have been held at his house. Its precise location is under investigation. 
      <p>In August 1812, the Albany paper noted the passing of William Kane and 
        that he had lived eighty years. Kane, his wife, and sons all were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=%22kane+source=web&ots=SoevXJrhCi&sig=dO5deQud78xyfGPZu2HF50J80To#v=onepage&q=&f=false">buried</a> 
        in the Dutch church plot.</p>
