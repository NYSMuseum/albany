<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>George Klinck</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> possibly <a href="http://boards.ancestry.ca/surnames.klink/4.6/mb.ashx">Johann Georg</a> Klink) appears to have been <a href="../../census1800.html#gk">born</a> before 1756. Although we <a href="http://news.rootsweb.com/th/read/GRAHAM/1997-01/0852434486">suspect</a> he was born in Germany, we seek more definitive <a href="http://boards.ancestry.co.uk/thread.aspx?mv=flat&m=11&p=surnames.klinck">information</a> on his background and early life.


<p>His wife was a somewhat younger Catherine Graham. Beginning in 1781, their children were christened at several Hudson Valley churches. During the 1790s, their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. 

<p>This George Klinck was known in Albany as a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> and a merchant. In December 1790, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> carried the notice that George Klinck the tailor had moved from 21 Maiden Lane to the corner of Washington Street near the German Lutheran church. He was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lutheran.html#1788">1788</a>, he was a pewholder in the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. But in 1792, Lutheran sources <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=%22george+klinck%22+albany&source=bl&ots=krz8eL0LuT&sig=LErVW7LX4Mb-1w3iHECOGzh6_mM&hl=en&ei=AEC7S_SaH8KAlAfEyNCfBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CBUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22george%20klinck%22%20albany&f=false">noted</a> that his name was among those stalwarts that had disappeared from church records. In 1802, he was one of the first trustees of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">U</a>nited Presbyterian church.

<p>In 1788, his first ward <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#gkh">house</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#gk">personal property</a> in the third ward were valued separately on the city assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#gk">1790</a>, the census noted six people in his first ward home. A decade later, his third ward <a href="../../census1800.html#gk">home</a> included four boys, two girls, and a middle-aged woman.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#bearer">1808</a>, he was a bearer at the funeral of a Market Street neighbor. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, the third ward assessment roll valued his houses and lots on <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a> and noted that he was a non resident at that time. Perhaps Mary Wallace was living in one of the houses.
 
<p>George Klinck was dead by June 5, 1812 when his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74dq=%22klinck+graham%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22klinck%20graham%22&f=false">1813</a>, two of his sons were listed in the first city directory.</p>
