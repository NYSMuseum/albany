<strong>John Kidney</strong></a> was born in September 1724. He was an older son in the very large family of <a href="rokid5999.html">Roeloff</a> and <a href="../b/engburger.html">Engeltie Burger</a> Kidney. He grew up in a cooper's <a href="../../census1756.html#190">home</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.


<p>He married Albany native <a href="../b/phbrooks6495.html">Phoebe Brooks</a>. Between 1753 and 1766, four children reflecting the parents of John and Pheobe had been christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>Beyond that, two John Kidneys are at risk from the 1750s on. At the same time, a John Kidney was <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~jankidney/index.html">killed by Indians</a> near Albany in March 1756. That individual would not have been the slooper listed on the <a href="../../census1756.html#205">census</a> of Albany householders taken by the British army in June of that year or the Albany freeholder identified in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5987">1763</a>.  That individual was accorded a modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> on his first ward property a few years later.

<p>At this point, we think that the husband of Phoebe was the householder, freeholder, and property owner and that his <a href="jokid5986.html">older uncle</a> was killed in 1756. 

<p>After the 1760s, the name is absent from Albany rolls. His son, <a href="jokid5989.html">Jonathan</a>, became an Albany mainstay and perhaps lived on the same <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> property as his father and as the first Kidney in Albany many decades before. </p>
