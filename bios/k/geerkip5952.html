<strong>Geertruy Kip</strong></a> was born in June 1705. She was a younger daughter in the large family of <a href="abkip5942.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../vd/geesvdh5687.html">Geesje Vanderheyden</a> Kip. She grew up in a merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.


<p>In December 1730, she married a somewhat younger <a href="../v/siveeder6776.html">Simon J. Veeder</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1742, four children had been christened in Albany where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Veeders made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Simon was building a business career that would make him one of the wealthiest Albany traders within a few decades.

<p>However, Geertruy Kip Veeder would not live to reap the benefits of their success. She was just forty-one when she died in July 1746. Three years later, Simon Veeder re-married. In 1765, her two surviving children were provided for in the <a href="../../wills/williskip.html">will</a> of her older brother.</p>
