<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacobus Kidney</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Jacob) was born in March 1735. He was the son of <a href="rokid5999.html">Roeloff</a> and <a href="../b/engburger.html">Engeltie Burger</a> Kidney. He grew up in a very large family in a modest cooper's home on the <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">hill</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

 <p>He may have been married as a women identified as "Jacobus Kidney's wife" 
        was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 
        July 1791. However, available <a href="../../churches.html">church</a> 
        records yield no marriage or family information for him.

<p>His father was alive until at least 1763. Presumably, he resided in his 
        father's house and perhaps then with one of his married sisters. One <a href="elkid5982.html">sister</a> 
        married the Albany jail keeper. <a href="gekid5983.html">Another</a> became 
        the wife of a newcomer Scot and was a widow by 1780 when Jacobus presented 
        her petition for use of a city-owned house. 

<p>In 1763, his <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">name</a> was not on 
        a list of Albany freeholders nor was his property considered on Albany 
        assessment rolls from the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>. 
        However, he may be the "<a href="../../solconst.html#j">Jacob ____</a>" 
        who signed a community-based document protesting the Stamp Act in 1766. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5985">1779</a> and again in 
        <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5985">1788</a>, his name would appear 
        on Albany assessment rolls as a boarder. Perhaps he was considered as 
        part of "Mrs. Kidney & Son" who were listed on a <a href="../../coerec1771.html">membership 
        roll</a> for <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church 
        in 1771. 
<p>Jacobus Kidney appears to have supported himself as a placeman for a number of community-based organizations. Beginning in 1773, he served as watchman, constable, and then as high constable - being elected or appointed to such positions for the remainder of his life. Several times, he was paid from the city treasury. During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, he served as doorkeeper and messenger for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> and the <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> 
        for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies. He was paid substantial sums 
        by the latter organization. Later, he was awarded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5985">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>The Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> for August 19, 1795 
        <a href="../../drc.html#sources">noted</a> the passing of Jacobus Kidney 
        as for "many years high constable of the city." Two days later, he was 
        buried from the Dutch church.</p>
