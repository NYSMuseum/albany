      <P><a href="#sources"><b>David Ketelhuyn</b></a> was born about 1670. He was the 
        son of Albany founders <a href="joketel4639.html">Jochem</a> and <a href="../w/anwillems4626.html">Anna 
        Willems</a> Ketelhuyn. Losing his father during the early 1680s, he was 
        raised by his mother in their third ward home.</p>


<p>In March 1695, he married <a href="../b/jobradt4252.html">Johanna Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1707, five children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>These Ketelhuyns set up their <a href="../../census1697.html#165">home</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> near the houses of his <a href="../../census1697.html#078">father-in-law</a>, <a href="danketel4633.html">brother</a> and widowed <a href="../../census1697.html#074">mother</a>.</p>

<p>David Ketelhuyn aspired to the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> but was fined several times for illegal trading. He sought to engage Native hunters beyond the Albany trading perimeter - specifically near Kinderhook. Seeking acceptance, he served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>, on juries, and as a constable for the third ward in 1703.  In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4634">1699</a>, he joined with his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England.</p>

<p>By 1703, he had relocated to the Halfmoon where he would serve as constable. He purchased land north of the Mohawk and at the new settlement called <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. In 1705, he sold his Albany house.  On October 20, 1711, he was killed by French and Indian raiders while at his <a href="danketel4633.html">brother</a>'s house in Schaghticoke. David Ketelhuyn had not lived fifty years!</p>
