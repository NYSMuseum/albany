<P>According to his marriage record, <a href="#sources"><b>John Kidney</b></a> was from Barbadoes. In May 1698, he married Albany native <a href="../vd/mavdw6678.html">Maria Roeloffs Vanderwerken</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1708, four sons had been baptized in Albany and further established the Kidney family in Albany and its hinterland.</p>

<p>At the time of his marriage, Kidney had been serving as a soldier in the <a href="../../garrison.html">Albany garrison</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5976">1699</a>, he joined with his Albany neighbors to swear allegiance to the king of England. Also that year, he was among those <a href="../../doc/cc/0627699.html">cited</a> for trading without possessing the "freedom" of the city.</p>

<p>These Kidneys lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> in a back-street neighborhood of former soldiers and others connected to the English fort. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5976">1709</a>, his "Southside" home was accorded a modest assessment. He served as deputy sheriff and belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.</p>

<p>In 1700, he had rented part of the Albany poor house. In 1720, his name appeared on a list of <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5976">qualified freeholders</a> in the first ward. 

<p>John Kidney was dead by June 8, 1722 when <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued to his widow who appears to have survived for several decades!</p>
