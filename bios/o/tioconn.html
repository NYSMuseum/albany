<P>Based on subsequent information, soldier and one time Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Timothy O'Connor</strong></a> (aka <a href="../../res/sp.html">Conner</a>) was born in <a href="../irish.html">Ire</a>land about 1718. We seek defining information on his specific <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Could he have been the "Timothy Conner" who, in August 1741, was identified in the <i>American Weekly Mercury</i> as of Irish origins, about 19 years old, and runaway from William Peters of Chester County, Pennsylvania? And/or was he the subject of a <a href="http://www.newspaperabstracts.com/link.php?action=detail&id=60862">notice</a> posted in 1746? In <a href="http://www.bradleyrymph.com/genealogy_morris-county.pdf">1747</a>, a same-named individual was identified as a counterfeiter in Morris County, New Jersey. This sketch organizes information on the Timothy O'Conner who lived in Albany during the 1750s and 60s and possibly longer. 

<p>In April 1756, this subject was in Albany when he married one "Mary Day" after three postings of banns at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, he was identified as a soldier. By August 1756, he had settled in as an innkeeper as he married widow "<a href="../h/elhopk.html">Elizabeth Loteridger</a>" also at the Albany church. Perhaps, his family consisted of Elizabeth's growing children - one of whom became an Albany innkeeper as well.

<p>In March <a href="https://books.google.com/books?ei=MV_KVMz7N7aLsQT_poL4CA&id=q_i0_D4waT0C&dq=%22timothy+conner%22&ots=jx3JXzs8jY&q=timothy+conner#v=snippet&q=timothy%20conner&f=false">1760</a>, his account for &pound; 10:8 was ordered paid by the city council.

<p>In April 1760, he was among those witnessing a baptism at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>This individual had been a career soldier with a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FCo8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA358&lpg=PA358&dq=%22timothy+conner%22+wm.+peters&source=bl&ots=oipEUe-us_&sig=52CfWYSwnJidfA6rGbSC1R1h9g8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iwzJVIMbtciwBMahgMgK&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22timothy%20conner%22&f=false">record of service</a>.  In May 1760, he enlisted in Stephen Schuyler's company in Albany County. At that <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FCo8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA358&lpg=PA358&dq=%22timothy+conner%22+wm.+peters&source=bl&ots=oipEUe-us_&sig=52CfWYSwnJidfA6rGbSC1R1h9g8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iwzJVIMbtciwBMahgMgK&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22timothy%20conner%22&f=false">time</a>, he was 42 years old, born in Ireland, 5' 6" tall, dark complexion, blue eyes, brown hair, and was identified as a "slator." He was recruited out of Hansen's militia company. 

<p>Perhaps he was among those who witnessed the will of another Irishman in New York City in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9EAGAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=%22John+Sandike%22&source=bl&ots=cPV0vWuyln&sig=GjOeTWW0tmX1yvz5fsEWVRArJm4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8nbKVLiYJKrIsQTnq4DQBQ&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=conover&f=false">October 1762</a>. 

<p>In <a  href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his house and property in the third ward were valued on an Albany assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#tioc">1788</a>, the estate of Dr. Henry Van Dyck showed a debt &pound;2:0:0 due from Timothy O'Conner.

<p>After that, his name has not been found on Albany city rolls. Clearly, <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/staffpubs/docs/20361.pdf">several</a> same-named contemporaries are at risk in the region - into and even beyond the Revolutionary era. Unable to further define this Albany resident who would have been more than eighty in 1800, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
