<strong>George Orian</strong></a> probably was born during the third quarter of the eighteenth century. <a href="../../res/sp.html">He</a> appears to have been of <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">African</a> ancestry.

<p>In April 1789, he married Elizabeth Jackson at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. In September 1790, their son was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he witnessed a baptism in 1793. John and <a href="../j/djackson1074.html">Diaan Jackson</a> were Orien's baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1800</a>, George Orian was listed as the head of a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household on the second Federal census. His household was composed of four "other free persons" - meaning "Free Blacks." A year earlier and again in 1802, his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a> and his store on Pearl Street were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">valued</a> on the second ward assessment rolls. In each instance, his holdings included two distinct parcels - a house and a store.

<p>George Orian's will passed probate in Albany on May 23, 1804.
