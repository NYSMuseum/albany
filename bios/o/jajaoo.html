<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Janse Oothout</strong></a> was born in Europe about 1630. Although probably <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> an actual resident of Albany or its predecessor, this <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer was the patriarch of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=lang_en&q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+van%20ness+albany#sclient=psy-ab&hl=en&lr=lang_en&tbs=lr:lang_1en&source=hp&q=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+oothout&pbx=1&oq=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov%2Falbany+oothout&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=e&gs_upl=7259l18067l0l18360l16l15l0l0l0l0l218l1953l5.9.1l15l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=d6f4b804f9f84a38&biw=1159&bih=698">Oothout family</a> of Albany and its <a href="../../albanycounty.html">environs</a>.

<p>By the 1650s, he had married brewer's daughter <a href="../vn/hevness919.html">Hendrickie Van Ness</a>. The marriage produced at least six children - christened prior to surviving church records. Their children became members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22jan+jansen%22&source=bl&ots=9O7TBVfA0C&sig=DU2Ts5HYfMH7L6yUW6MUkhhX8aI&hl=en&ei=yiviTtSYMInf0QHtwIm9BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22jan%20jansen%22&f=false">1660</a>, he witnessed the signing of a contract. In 1663, he <a href="../../res/ts.html">was</a> identified as a member of the Crailo night watch.

<p>In March 1664, Oothout and his father-in-law, <a href="../vn/covness887.html">Cornelis Van Ness</a>, testified to their joint <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=%22jan+oothout%22&source=bl&ots=9O7TBVfA0C&sig=DU2Ts5HYfMH7L6yUW6MUkhhX8aI&hl=en&ei=yiviTtSYMInf0QHtwIm9BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22jan%20oothout%22&f=false">ownership</a> of a brewery in <i>greyne bos</i> - probably nearby the house he had held there since at least 1661.   

<p>In 1674, he was among those invited to the <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#5310">funeral</a> of the <a href="../vr/jevr.html">Patroon</a>.

<p>Jan Janse Oothout filed a <a href="../../wills/willjjoo.html">will</a> in March 1688. He identified himself as a brewer of Greenbush. It named six living children as the heirs to his real and personal property. He was dead by January 1695 when his will passed probate.</p>
