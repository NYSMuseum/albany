<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and <a href="#name">referred</a> to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Matthew Orsen</strong></a> lived in Albany at least during the decade before the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">outbreak</a> of hostilities in 1775. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, our research challenge begins with an <a href="../../res/guess.html">un</a>certainty in defining a useful spelling of his surname. Beyond that, similarly named contemporaries were living in the region.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a>, one "Matheus Aerse" was named constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Thus, he <a href="../../res/guess.html">probably</a> was born prior to 1740.

<p>In February 1764, "Matheus Aarsen" <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iRtEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22Matheus+Aarsen%22&source=bl&ots=qwF0_fLfNJ&sig=OXeKzx3Vt3l4wj-lU3IJ-G8g2gw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qWBbVaO7JozasASQlYPIBg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22Matheus%20Aarsen%22&f=false">married</a> twenty-four-year-old "<a href="../vh/brvhoesen749.html">Bregje Van Hoesen</a>" at the Albany, <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, they were identified as young people "both of this city." Between 1773 and 1784, three children were christened at the Albany Dutch church leading to speculation that additional children were baptized in other regional churches.
<a name=res>
<p>During the mid-1760s, "Arsen's" house and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> modestly. Also on the roll in 1767, was the modest property of one William "Orsen."

<p>In May 1773, "Matthew Orson's" <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA246&lpg=PA246&dq=%22matthew+orson%22&source=bl&ots=wygEaQwffv&sig=4PoppVQ-CKi8RN29FMHOrfNcOsU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SjxfVazEBIqlyQTtwIKQCA&ved=0CEEQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22matthew%20orson%22&f=false">account</a> for &pound;1:10 was ordered to be paid from the city treasury.

<p>On several occasions in 1778, "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=b0LzQaB3ctAC&pg=PA123&lpg=PA123&dq=%22Mr.+Mathew+Aerson%22&source=bl&ots=SLWH7PYWnt&sig=-SSQtC8V1vb7p-73nVS7M-IpiC4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=waVcVY2DN9HisAS5nICwAg&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Mr.%20Mathew%20Aerson%22&f=false">Mr. Mathew Aerson</a>" was identified as a "<a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>man" and was active in <a href="../../cddc.html">moving</a> soldiers <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=b0LzQaB3ctAC&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22Mathew+Aerson%22&source=bl&ots=SLWH7PYXvo&sig=aMbgtnHggoYQ0_Vv_uGItKCBSVo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=caZcVbCoBrLLsASi94L4DQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Mathew%20Aerson%22&f=false">across</a> the river. Later, he submitted <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=8qlCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA810&lpg=PA810&dq=%22Mathew+Aerson%22&source=bl&ots=urXuCXrV12&sig=ugIToFueEveDrtWASGMWV50od2U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=caZcVbCoBrLLsASi94L4DQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22Mathew%20Aerson%22&f=false">accounts</a> for that work. Perhaps <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=0Sk7AQAAMAAJ&pg=RA3-PA121&lpg=RA3-PA121&dq=%22matthew+orsen%22&source=bl&ots=Klx7loOB0f&sig=Bf9Iy_qh8WvaZ2jom__o5522W1U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ojpfVYGNJoiSyQTtkAI&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22matthew%20orsen%22&f=false">claims</a> for compensation submitted much later to Congress relate to this individual as well. We recognize that we have only a superficial appreciation of his wartime activities.


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>,"Mathew Arson's" household was configured on the census returns for <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> - probably on the east side of the Hudson. A that time, two, men, two boys, and two females resided under his roof. Next to him on the census was the landmark Greenbush home of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Evert_Van_Alen">John E. Van Allen</a>.

<p>After that, the name of <b>this</b> individual known as Matthew Orsen <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Aersen has not been found in the community based record or in our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Int</a>ernet-based resources. With basic life questions still unanswered, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
