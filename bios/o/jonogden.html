<strong>Jonathan Ogden</strong></a> was an innkeeper in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and an Albany resident during the second half of the eighteenth century.

<P>Although not identified by name, he probably was the son of a New York innkeeper <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2001-07/0994945252">Jonathan Ogden</a> and his wife "Willmont" as named in the elder Ogden's will filed in 1750.

<p>Perhaps, he was the innkeeper identified as "<a href="../../census1756.html#236">Jno. Osman</a>" on a census of Albany householders taken in 1756.

<p>In December 1758, he married Rachel Vanderheyden of Albany at the Schenectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their daughter, "Willmont," was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church in December 1759.

<p>At the time of his marriage he was identified as a captain in the New York regiment of Westchester. <a href="../../fhg.html#spfs">Tr</a>aditional sources, have identified him as an innkeeper who lived on Church  Street in Schenectady.

<p>In 1764, he was a prospective juror and characterized as a "vintner" of Schenectady. His <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house and property in Albany was evaluated and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">taxed</a> in 1766 and 1767. At the same time, Ogden's Schenectady property was accorded a high assessment - comparable to that levied on businessmen. In 1771, the <a href="../../wills/willjovdh5697.html">will</a> of his father-in-law noted the house where Ogden resided.  

<p>However, he seems to have been primarily a Schenectady resident. Jonathan Ogden was last heard from in March 1788 when he joined other Schenectady residents in petitioning the <a href="../../sources.html#cp">governor</a>. Perhaps his will was filed in Schenectady between 1791 and 1802.</p>

The life of Jonathan Ogden has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Same-named individuals were alive in Cherry Valley, Westchester, and New Jersey at that time. At this time we must be cautious and search harder for defining information.
