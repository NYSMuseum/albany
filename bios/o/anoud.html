<strong>Anna Ouderkerk</strong></a> was born during the first half of the eighteenth century - probably after 1720. She possibly was the daughter of Abraham Ouderkirk and grew up in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany area</a>.
As fringe Albany people, records for the Ouderkerks are more scattered and less conspicuous than for the more <a href="../../familynames.html">mainline</a> Albany families.

<p>After August 1764, she became the second wife of <a href="../w/pwaldron671.html">Pieter Waldron</a> - a widower with grown and almost grown children. By 1785, four of her Waldron children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Her husband was a bricklayer or mason and they lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>Anna Ouderkerk Waldron probably did not survive into the 1790s. Her husband may have lived longer. But then approaching eighty, he would have faded from the community record.</p>

Because we are unsure of her origins, the life of Anna Ouderkerk Waldron has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Without solid demographic information, this sketch is pre-mature and is offered here in conjunction with the life of her <a href="../w/pwaldron671.html">husband</a>.
