      <P>Future Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Ostrander</strong></a> 
        was born in September 1688. He most likely was the son of Ulster County 
        residents Pieter and Rebecca Traphagen Ostrander. However, we seek more 
        definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. Sometimes referred to as "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Van 
        Ostrande</a>," he may have been the first Ostrander to live in the city 
        of Albany.</P>
      <p>In February 1713, he married <a href="../vd/elvdb5773.html">Elizabeth 
        Vandenbergh</a> at the church in Kingston. Following the wedding, the 
        couple appears to have relocated to Albany. In January 1715, the first 
        child was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1739, the couple had baptized eleven more children at the Albany church 
        where Johannes was a regular baptism sponsor. 
      <p>This Ostrander family first made its home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a> where Johannes was appointed firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1718">1718</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#joost">1720</a>, his name appeared 
        on a first ward freeholders list. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1723">1723</a>, 
        1724, and 1727, he was elected assistant alderman. By <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">1729</a>, 
        he had relocated to the first ward where he was elected assistant alderman. 
        He was reelected five more times. In 1731, this Kingston native applied 
        and was granted freeman's status. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#joost">1715</a>, 
        his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. During these years, his home was a first ward <a href="http://www.albanyweblog.com/2007/08-Aug/08-04-07_Ref_02.html">landmark</a> 
        and his accounts were paid by the city. 
      <P>Johannes Ostrander was last heard from in Albany in June 1735 when he 
        was paid by the city for "laying ground along the city wall." We seek 
        information on his later life and passing. </p>
