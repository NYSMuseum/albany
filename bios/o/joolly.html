<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Olly</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Christopher or Johan Christopher Ohle) was born during the first half of the eighteenth century. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. He probably was of <a href="../ger.html">Ger</a>man ancestry and <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/william-henry-egle/names-of-foreigners-who-took-the-oath-of-allegiance-to-the-province-and-state-of-wel/page-18-names-of-foreigners-who-took-the-oath-of-allegiance-to-the-province-and-state-of-wel.shtml">perhaps</a> emigrated to Pennsylvania where he was among those newcomers <a href="../../nat.html">nat</a>uralized in 1751. This individual is defined as the first of possibly three, same-named individuals to live in Albany during the second half of the century.

<p>By April 1756, he was married to a woman named "Anna Geertruy" when their daughter was christened at the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In December <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyschoha/baptstpa.html">1754</a>, same-named parents christened a daughter at the Lutheran church in Schoharie. Perhaps, later Albany resident "<a href="joolly2890.html">Christopher Olly, Sr.</a>" was Johan Christopher's son.

<p>In July <a href="../../census1756.html#21">1756</a>, "Christopher Olly" was identified as a "retailer of liquor" on an inventory of Albany households made by the British army. His house was deemed suitable to quarter up to six enlisted men but no officers. At that time, Olly's family occupied only one room.
 
<p>With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding the life of this John Olly <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">we move on</a> for now. </p>
