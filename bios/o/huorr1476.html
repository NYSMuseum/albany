<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hugh Orr</b></a> probably was born during the 1740s. He may have spent some of his younger days in Dutchess County. In June 1775, a Hugh Orr and other family members signed the Continental Association in Northeast Precinct. Two months later, Hugh Orr certified militia commissions in Dutchess County.</p>

<p>In November 1777, he had a house in the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady District</a>. Two months later, he was brought before the Schenectady Committee and fined for selling liquor without a license.</p>


<p>By 1779, he had relocated to Albany and was sharing space in a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">1781</a>, he was among those newcomers who purchased the right to conduct business within the jurisdiction of the city of Albany. At that time, he was identified as a merchant. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1788tl">1788</a>, his house and property in the heart of the third ward business district were included on the Albany assessment roll.</p>

<p>His wife's name was Isabella. The marriage produced at least one <a href="elorr6819.html">daughter</a> who married Albany merchant John Waters and <a href="../../census1790.html#6821">lived</a> next to them on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a>.</p>

<p>Hugh Orr was dead by March 1790 when his will passed probate. His widow received letters of administration on his estate and was identified as the head of their third ward household on the first Federal <a href="../../census1790.html#1476">census</a>.</p>
