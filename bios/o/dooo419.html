<P><a href="#sources"><b>Dorothea Oothout</b></a> was born in December 1687. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="heoo428.html">Hendrick Janse</a> and <a href="../d/cadouw2063.html">Catharina Douw</a> Oothout. She grew up in Albany and on family farms across the Hudson River in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck </a>.</p>


<p>In October 1707, she married <a href="../b/cobogert6063.html">Cornelis Bogert</a> at her father's Albany house. Less than three months later, the first of their six children was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a pewholder and frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Dorothea Oothout Bogert lost her husband in 1755. She was <a href="../../wills/willcobogert6063.html">named executor</a> and beneficiary of his estate. In <a href="../../census1756.html#262">1756</a>, she was identified as the head of their Albany household. In 1766 and '67, her modest <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> house was included on city assessment rolls. After that, her name dropped from Albany records.</p>
