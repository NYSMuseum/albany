<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Christopher Olly, Sr. </strong></a> probably was born during the early 1750s. We <a href="../../res/origins.html">expect</a> that he was the son of newcomer <a href="joolly.html">John Olly</a>. We refer to this individual as Christopher Olly, Sr. to prevent confusion with two similarly named contemporaries.

<p>In March 1773, "Christopher Oley, Sr." married Helena Carrel at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. In 1778 and 1780, the couple christened two daughters at the  Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In November 1785, the "Wife of Christpher Oley" was buried from that church.

<p>In March and October <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2890">1779</a>, "Sr's." real property was valued on Albany assessment rolls in the first ward. A 
<a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2890">decade later</a>, and then in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his modest holdings were valued on the first ward assessment.

<p>In September 1788, his unspecified lots (held in conjunction with his neighbor widow Cole) were leased to <a href="../g/dagibson.html">David Gibson</a> for fifteen years. In October 1802, his lots on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> were referenced in a real estate transaction.  

<p>Probably in his twenties during the 1770s, we seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. However, afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2890">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2890">1790</a> and <a href="../../census1800.html#2890">1800</a>, his first ward household was enumerated on the first city censuses. 

<p>Perhaps both Christopher Ollys were included under the <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=view&r=0&dbid=7613&iid=4433166_00021&fn=Christopher&ln=Oley&st=r&ssrc=&pid=189392">same</a> Colonie household on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census in 1810</a>. </p>
 
<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of the Albany resident known as "Christopher Olly, Sr."
