<p><a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish ancestry <a href="#sources">John Ogilvie</a> (occasionally "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Oglivie</a>") was born in or near New York City in 1722 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cF5EAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=symmes+oglivie&source=bl&ots=FWlx7EhJJs&sig=PDARXJ0Vp5kO4Y-MivkAVtJHbxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipkOuCw7vMAhUEaz4KHf0HCwIQ6AEIITAB#v=snippet&q=%22william%20ogilvie%22&f=false">or</a> 1724. His father, Lieutenant William, <a href="../../res/sp.html">Og</a>ilvie was a British army officer. 

<p>Young John was an appt student and graduated from <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CapGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA174&dq=ogilvie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilvbmhmbnMAhUIbz4KHdiZD3sQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&q=ogilvie&f=false">Yale</a> in 1748. His professional life began as a teacher and lay reader in New England. Expecting to be appointed an SPG missionary, he went abroad and was ordained in London in 1749. He returned to America and then, upon the recommendation of Reverend <a href="../b/hebarclay.html">Henry Barclay</a>, took up his post in Albany. </p>


<p> <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/joglivie.jpg" hspace=4 vspace=4 border=0 align=right width=200 height=248 alt="John Ogilvie"></a> He served as rector at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church from 1749 to 1760. He is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=CapGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA174&dq=ogilvie&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwilvbmhmbnMAhUIbz4KHdiZD3sQ6AEINzAE#v=onepage&q=ogilvie&f=false">said</a> to have been able to preach in Dutch. During the 1750s, he also served as a chaplain to the British army. After several years as a missionary at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a> and in Canada, in 1764 he would be named assistant minister of Trinity Church in New York. During that time, he occasionally supplied the pulpit of several parishes in the Hudson Valley.</p>

<p>The second part of Ogilvie's tenure in Albany came during the <a href="../../stpeters.html#war">Seven Years War</a>. His <a href="../../census1756.html#89">Albany home</a> was a gathering place for English speakers while he instructed more than a hundred Dutch-speaking local children.</p>

<p>John Ogilvie married twice. He married <a href="../s/sucasymes.html">Susanna Catharine Symes</a> (daughter of another colonial British military family) in New York in September 1751. They had five children prior to her death - probably in 1769. He then married Margaret Marston, widow of manor lord Philip Philipse.</p>
            
<p>Fifty-year-old John Ogilvie was ill when he wrote his <a href="#will">will</a> in November 1774. It mentioned his second wife and a son and daughter. He <a href="http://soc.genealogy.medieval.narkive.com/OqpXl3Fa/rev-john-ogilvie-d-d-of-albany-and-new-york-city">died</a> from a cerebral hemmorhage in New York City a few days later and was buried in the family vault in Trinity churchyard.</p>

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Rev. John Ogilvie is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 8032. Perhaps he was named for the Jesuit Saint John Ogilvie! Ogilvie and resources related to him are subjects of a <a href="http://external.oneonta.edu/cooper/articles/nyhistory/1914nyhistory-holden.html">letter</a> written by the New York State Historian in 1915. His <a href="http://www.nygbs.org/info/articles/Episcopal_Records.html">church records</a> from 1749, are the earliest we have encountered for St. Peter's. See also, "The diary of the Reverend John Ogilvie, 1750-1759" in <i>Bulletin of the Fort Ticonderoga Museum</i>, v. 10, no. 5 (1961); and <i>An elegy on the death of the Reverend John Ogilvie, D.D.: Who departed this life the 26th of November, 1774</i>, by "<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/elegy-on-the-death-of-the-reverend-john-ogilvie-dd-who-departed-this-life-the-26th-of-november-1774/oclc/62823668/editions?editionsView=true&referer=br">young Gentleman of this city</a>." Probably the most substantial narrative profile (and bibliography) appears in the <a href="http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ogilvie_john_4E.html"><i>DCB</i></a>.
