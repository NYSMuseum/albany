<strong>Lea Ostrander </strong></a> was born in February 1724. She was a daughter in the large family of Albany area residents Johannes and Elizabeth Vandenbergh Ostrander.

<p>By 1752, she had married <a href="../vd/covdu5514.html">Cornelis Van Deusen</a>. By 1771, seven of her children had been christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>These Van Deusens raised their family in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Cornelis earned a living by doing odd jobs and with fees received from the Albany government. 

<p>In March 1761, Lea was <a href="../../wills/willcoblo1464.html">identified</a> as the niece and heir of Cornelis Maase. At that time, her husband was named co-executor of Cornelis Maase's estate.

<p>By the late 1780s, the name of Cornelis Van Deusen had dropped from Albany rolls. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, at least two of their sons headed Albany households. Perhaps Lea was living with one of them. 

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Lea Ostrander Van Deusen. </p>
