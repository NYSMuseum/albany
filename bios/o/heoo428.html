<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Janse Oothout</b></a> was born about 1663. He was the second son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers 
        Jan Janse and Hendricktie Van Ness Oothout. His father was a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> 
        in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and then Albany.</p>

<p>In April 1684, he married Albany native <a href="../d/cadouw2063.html">Catharina 
        Douw</a>. By 1705, their eleven children had been baptized at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members 
        and regular baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>Hendrick Janse lived in <a href="../../census1697.html#034">Albany</a>, 
        on an <a href="../../wills/willjjoo.html">inherited</a> countryside farm, and, for a time during the 1690s, in New York City. Like his father, he was a businessman, <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a>, and <a href="../../res/realestate.html">landholder</a>. His <a href="../d/vjd.html">father-in-law</a> was similarly prominent and a brewer as well.  Hendrick Janse was annually elected assistant alderman for the first ward from 1698 to 1704. During that time, he was active 
        as a contractor, surveyor, and justice. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html">1699</a>, 
        he joined his neighbors in pledging allegiance to the king of England. 
        His <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was taxed as those 
        of other substantial community leaders. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#428">1715</a>, 
        his name appeared on an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        roster. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#428">1720</a>, he was listed 
        among the freeholders living in the first ward.</p>
      <p>Hendrick Janse Oothout filed a <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">will</a> 
        in October 1738. Seven surviving children but not his deceased wife were 
        named in that document. At that time, he identified himself as a yeoman 
        of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. His estate 
        included a lot in Albany, pasture land south of the city, a farm called 
        "Turkeye" on the west bank of the Hudson where he was living, woodlands, 
        four islands in the Hudson, and personal property. He died in July 1739. 
        His will passed probate in April 1740.</p>
