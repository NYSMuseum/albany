<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Oothout</strong></a> was born in December 1703. She was a younger daughter of <a href="heoo428.html">Hendrick Janse</a> and <a href="../d/cadouw2063.html">Catharina Douw</a> Oothout. She grew up a member of a large family in homes in Albany and its <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">hinterland</a>.  

<p>In December 1733, Anna would have been about thirty when she married <a href="../q/piq2302.html">Pieter Quackenbush</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced at least four sons but only two of them seem to have been christened there. Perhaps others were baptized beyond Albany.

<p>In October 1738, her father's <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">will</a> left her a one-fifth share of her father's farm. At that time, she was among seven surviving siblings.

<p>This Quackenbush family made their home in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> where Pieter was a prominent resident.

<p>Anna Oothout Quackenbush died in 1757 and was buried from the church. Her husband survived until at least 1782.</p>
