<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick Oothout, Jr. </strong></a> was born in May 1742. He was the first child born to the marriage of <a href="jooo445.html">Jonas Oothout</a> and his first wife <a href="../l/ellansing3236.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Oothout. She died in 1754 and Jonas remarried. Their large family lived on a <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">substantial</a> piece of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">property</a> north of the city and <a href="../../im/im1767.html">near</a> the cross-river <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a>. For the most part, this biography relies on information <a href="../../res/sp.html">for</a> "Henry Oothout, Jr." Another (more <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OV3XbgG9vbEC&pg=PA712&lpg=PA712&dq=%22oothoudt+henry%22+albany&source=web&ots=9LXQn1AL1N&sig=J-2HNRRHmvu6RvYO7CraEd9HsxM#v=onepage&q=%22oothoudt%20henry%22%20albany&f=false">prominent</a> and older) similarly named contemporary <a href="../qqqq.html">com</a>plicates our ambitions.

<p>In September 1765, this Henry married Albany native <a href="../d/lydouw2147.html">Lydia Douw</a>  at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1786, ten of their eleven children had been christened at the church where he was a member, pewholder, and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>In 1768, his wife was left a substantial bequest (of money and property) in the <a href="../../wills/willvodouw2233.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>In December 1777, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjovdouw.html">will</a> of his wife's uncle.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">War</a> years, Henry Jr. was a member of the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> (in 1775) for <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck and a "First Lieutenant" in the Third or Rensselaerswcyk <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6lQOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=%22henry+oothoudt%22&source=bl&ots=bSBThUkeTx&sig=aBm1dU_iFpeapagJPUG_qR6eCXg&hl=en&ei=g3WTTPWoH8P68AacuKmZDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&sqi=2&ved=0CCsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20oothoudt%22&f=false">regiment</a> of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. Afterwards, he was accorded a land bounty right in conjunction with the third regiment.

<p>In September 1779, "Henry Outhout, Jun." was among the Albany people who signed a <a href="../../doc/petvd1779.html">petition</a> for the return of Dr. Henry Van Dyck.

<p>In 1788, "Henry Oothout, Jr." was one of those who made an <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html">inventory</a> of the estate of Hendrick Bogert. He and a number of his kin were named as creditors in the document.

<p>His name has not been found on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">assessment rolls</a> consulted thus far. However, the Albany assessment roll for 1779 was signed by "Henry Oothoudt, Superintndts of Taxes." Perhaps his household was configured on the Watervliet census in <a href="../../census1790.html#430">1790</a>. 
 
<p>Hendrick Oothout, Jr. died in May 1818. Once we lock in the death date of the other Henry Oothout, we expect to be able to further articulate this individual's profile.</p>
