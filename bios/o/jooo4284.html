<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes Oothout</strong></a> was born about 1665. He was the son of Jan Janse and Hendrickie Van Ness Oothout. Early in 1696, he was granted letters to administer the estate of his deceased father. He also inherited a "red mare."

<p>In May 1689, he married the widow <a href="../e/aeverts7969.html">Aeltie Everts Lubberts</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1707, six children had been christened at the Albany church where the parents were long-time members.  

<p>These Oothouts made their <a href="../../census1697.html#164">home</a> in Albany where Johannes was active in community-based activities such as joining with his neighbors in pledging loyalty to the king of England in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4284">1699</a>. His Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">house</a> was in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. After 1700, he re-located his family to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, where he was a mainline resident for the remainder of his life. His house near the highway leading from Albany was noted in the <a href="../../wills/willcowvdb.html">will</a> of his neighbor filed in 1705.
 
<p>Johannes Oothout buried his wife in December 1739. He died in February 1745.</p>
