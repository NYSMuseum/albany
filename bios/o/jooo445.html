<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jonas Oothout</strong></a> was born in December 1705. He was the last of the eleven children of <a href="heoo428.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../d/cadouw2063.html">Caatje Douw</a> Oothout. He grew up as the youngest child in the first ward home of a mainline brewer/businessman and on Hendrick's <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farm.

<p>He was named among the heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">will</a> filed by his father in October 1738. He was named co-executor of the estate. Jonas was left several islands, a house, woodlands, and other real <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> from his father's estate. At the same time, this youngest son was instructed to parcel out the other resources to his sisters. His mother probably was deceased and his two older brothers already had received their shares of Hendrick Oothout's estate. 

<p>In March 1741, he married <a href="../l/ellansing3236.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a pewholder. After bearing at least five children, Elizabeth died in 1754. In April 1756, he wed <a href="../v/elvinhagen3416.html">Elizabeth Vinhagen</a> also at the Albany church. That union added two more children to his combined family.
 
<p>In 1742, his name appeared on a <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#445">list</a> of freeholders in Rensselaerswyck. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his holdings in the "West Manor" were valued modestly. A <a href="../../im/im1767.html"#26>map</a> of Rensselaerswyck dated 1767, set his home along the river, north of the Schuylers, across from Green Island.

<p>In 1769, his land north of Albany was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willsvr5114.html">will</a> of Stephen Van Rensselaer, II.

<p>Born in 1705, this Jonas Oothout seems to have passed on during the 1770s. Younger, same-named individuals were identified in the regional record for the years after 1770. In 1788, "Jonas Oothout" owed more than four pounds to the <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html">estate</a> of Hendrick Bogert. Another notation in that inventory <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html#jooo">mentioned</a> the "unfettered" account of Jonas for more than 19 pounds. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of this Albany native and Rensselaerswyck resident.

<p>Jonas's widowed second wife (Elizabeth Vinhagen) <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22jonas+oothout%22&source=bl&ots=aMFCPpQawQ&sig=vcfs6ZJV7SMsuvvGu0oGOIGtejA&hl=en&ei=9tJPTrmtOYTy0gHy2IzwCA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22jonas%20oothout%22&f=false">died</a> in March 1806 - in her 92nd year. </p>
