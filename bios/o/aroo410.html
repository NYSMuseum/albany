<P>Subsequent information tells us that  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ari Oothout</strong></a> was born about 1676. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New</a> Netherland pioneers <a href="jajaoo.html">Jan Janse</a> and <a href="../vn/hevness919.html">Hendrickie Van Ness</a> Oothout. He was a younger son in the family of an eastside <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> brewer.


<p>He was named (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Arien</a>) in the <a href="../../wills/willjjoo.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1688. At that time, he was twelve years old. His father was dead by 1695 when the will passed probate. This third surviving son was well provided for through his father's bequest which included provision for his training in a trade.

<p>In November 1700, "Adriaan" married <a href="../l/laloock5937.html">Lammertje Loockermans</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, the newlyweds were living in "New Albany." By 1723, their nine children had been christened in the church where the parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#410">1699</a> and in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">1701</a>, Ari was among those who had signed a loyalty oath to the Protestant King of England.

<p>These Oothouts initially made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Assessment rolls for the early <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1700s</a> taxed his property <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#410">mod</a>erately.

<p>In 1715, Adriaen was listed as a private in a Manor based Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a> and again in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#410">1742</a>, his name was appearing on freeholder lists for Rensselaerswyck.
<p>Ari Oothout died in the winter of 1752 and was buried from the Albany church on February 2.</p>
