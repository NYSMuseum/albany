<strong>Josina Orchard</strong></a> probably was born during the late1720s. She probably was the daughter of Thomas and Maria Orchard (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Archer</a>). Perhaps her  family lived in the <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> area.

<p>About 1747, she married twenty-one-year-old Albany native <a href="../c/jacooper485.html">Jacob Cooper</a>. By 1768, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she had been a regular baptism sponsor over several decades.

<P>These Coopers made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Jacob was a baker. By the late 1760s, they also were leasing a farm on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#485">1790</a>, Cooper's Watervliet home included nine family members and was located near the houses of other Cooper family members.  

<p>Jacob Cooper died in 1813. He left a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a>. We seek additional information on Josina's later life and passing.</p>
