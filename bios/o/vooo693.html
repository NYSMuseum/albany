<strong>Volkert Oothout</strong></a> was born in October 1692. He was the son of <a href="heoo428.html">Hendrick Janse</a> and <a href="../d/cadouw2063.html">Catharina Douw</a> Oothout. He grew up a middle child in the large family of an Albany and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck businessman and brewer who also held property in New York City.

<p>He may have started out as an Indian trader as during the early 1730s he was among those Albany people charged with <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RMO7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA539&lpg=PA539&dq=%22volkert+oothout%22&source=bl&ots=aaF1eCfUTV&sig=1e4oh-ZTaKYw4c4lll0S6K3810E&hl=en&ei=GU26SqPvFt2z8Qbw_siMCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#v=onepage&q=%22volkert%20oothout%22&f=false">unlawfully trading to the westward</a> and fined by the province of New York. After that, he seems to have settled in Albany and succeeded to his father's brewery.

<p> In January 1735, he married <a href="../d/cadridder.html">Catharina De Ridder</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. This marriage of older partners appears to have been childless. In May 1742, he witnessed a baptism at Linlithgo with his wife. He was an occasional sponsor in Albany as well.

<p>In October 1738, Volkert Oothout was identified as the eldest surviving son and heir-at-law in the <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">will</a> filed by his aged  father. However, that document stipulated that he already had received his inheritance and was further indebted to his father.

<p>In August 1741, he was a named a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H4HfAAAAMAAJ&q=%22volkert+oothout%22&dq=%22volkert+oothout%22">partner</a> in a royal <a href="../../res/realestate.html">patent</a> for 13,000 acres of bottomland in what became Otsego County.


<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#160">1756</a>, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> on a census of Albany householders made by the British army. His father and grandfather had been brewers as well.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#693">1763</a>, he was listed among the Albany freeholders. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>, his house and property were valued on an Albany assessment roll for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>A younger Volkert Oothout married in 1774 and raised a family in Albany over the next decades.</p>
