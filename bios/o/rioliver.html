<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously,  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Richard Oliver</strong></a> lived in Albany during the middle decades of the eighteenth century. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>.

<p>Perhaps, he was the son of Jan Oliver and Maria Vanderlinde whose children were <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~sigsbee/fam00779.htm">said</a> to have been christened in  Albany during the first decades of the century. Or, <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lopezislandhistory/sager/oliver2.txt">possibly</a> he was the son or other kinsman of Charles Oliver of New York, although a Richard was not among the two sons and two daughters named in the will Charles filed about 1718.

<p>In October 1734, this subject married the recently widowed <a href="../b/mabennewe.html">Martha Bennewe</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Just nine months after the wedding, the first of four children was christened at the Albany church.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#48">1756</a>, his name appeared on a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">list</a> of Albany householders generated by the British army. At that time, he was identified as a "dramshop" proprietor. 

<p>During the late 1750s, Richard and Martha witnessed three baptisms at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>However, in September 1763, Richard Oliver of Albany <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/oh_q.html">married</a> one Bata <a href="../q/q.html">Q</a>uackenbush of 
<a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Kanastagioone</a> at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. In 1766, the property of "Dirck Oliver" was <a href="../../sources.html#uny">assessed modestly</a> within the jurisdiction of Schenectady.

<p>During the 1780s, a younger Richard Oliver (1753-1806) applied for <a href="http://archive.org/stream/calendarofnycolo00alba#page/710/mode/2up">land</a> in New York based on his service as a lieutenant in the US Army (<a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=heitman+officers&printsec=frontcover&source#v=onepage&q=oliver&f=false">referenced</a> as paymaster in "<a href="http://valleyforgemusterroll.org/regiments/malcolm.asp">Malcolm's Continental Regiment</a>). That individual retired from service in January 1781.

<p>With a number of possible origins/identities and with essential <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the life of Albany resident Richard Oliver still unanswered, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
