<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>John J. Ostrander, Jr.</strong></a> was born in November 1774. Family-based information fixes his birthplace as <a href="../w/cawetz6619.html#ec">Germantown</a> in today's Columbia County. He was the son of <a href="joostranderjr.html">John Ostrander, Jr.</a> and his wife, <a href="../w/cawetz6619.html">Catherine Wetzell</a> Ostrander. His parents were from "East Camp" but were moved around greater Albany County due to his father's wartime <a href="../../or/pension/penjoostjr.html">service</a>. He is functionally delineated as "John J. [sometimes corrupted to I.] Ostrander, Jr." to prevent confusion with several similarly named individuals.

<p>His family settled permanently in Albany in 1784. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued separately under his father's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings.

<p>He married <a href="../m/anmuir.html">Anna Muir</a>. Their daughter was christened at the Albany Dutch church in July 1800. The marriage appears to have <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~donkelly/WILLIAMSON/Williamson_track/index.htm">produced</a> other children as well.

<p>In January 1800 he was named co-executor in the <a href="../../wills/willjoostjr.html">will</a> filed by his father who died shortly thereafter. Later that year, this subject's first ward household first was configured on the <a href="../../census1800.html#jojos">census</a> next to that of his widowed mother. For the next three decades he remained an Albany mainstay.		

<p>In January 1808, he was among those Albany personages who were invited to the <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#joos">funeral</a> of Henry J. Bleecker.

<p>This individual was an <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a> (<a href="../qqqq.html">need</a> information on his training and career profile) and a member of a number of community-based organizations. He also acquired a number of parcels of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> in the first ward. 

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22ostrander+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22ostrander+%20john%22&f=false">1813</a>, "John I. Ostrander" was listed in the city directories as "Examiner in chancery" at what became 9 and later 55 <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a>. As late as 1830, he was practicing law from the latter address.

<p>In May 1815, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../..//wills/willedwillett2905.html">estate</a> of a neighbor and fellow attorney.

<p>In 1816-17, "John I. Ostrander" (several same-named contemporaries) was identified as a member of the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> representing Albany County as a Federalist.

<p>This individual was a pillar of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html#jojos">1825</a>, he was identified as a deacon when included on the roster of the "Great Consistory."

<p>Subsequent documents <a href="../../or/pension/penjoostjr.html">noted</a> that he re-located (along with his mother) to Onondaga County in 1832. His household was configured on the census for the town of Tully in <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?gl=ROOT_CATEGORY&rank=1&new=1&so=3&MSAV=0&msT=1&gss=ms_r_f-2_s&gsfn=John+I&gsln=Ostrander&msbdy=1774&uidh=9w2">1840</a>.

  
<p>John J. Ostrander, Jr. is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=pete%5Fwitze&id=I32797">said</a> to have died in September 1849 and was buried in the Tully cemetery. His widow <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=pete%5Fwitze&id=I33398">lived on</a> in Onondaga County until her death in 1865.</p>
