<!-- Start Main Content -->
<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=amfonda&id=ind07664">sources</a>, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Jan Janse Ouderkerk</strong></a> (aka Ouder<a href="../../res/sp.html">kirk</a>) was born in the <a href="../../nnd.html">Netherlands</a> about 1640. By December 1660, he had emigrated to America and had settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he was involved in a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OmgtSY2-DuQC&pg=PA535&lpg=PA535&dq=%22jan+jansen+ouderkerck%22&source=bl&ots=TnxTI0uXiZ&sig=o4WUtK_IFpD0VegMwBCkQLNDiBY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IbCuU9aUFo_FoATujID4DA&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22jan%20jansen%20ouderkerck%22&f=false">court action</a>. He was known as a barrel maker in the <a href="../../earlycity.html">community</a> that became Albany in 1664.

<p>His wife appears to have been named "Ariaantie." By 1686, they had six or more children some of whom were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member.

<p>In May <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GtoTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=will+jan+janse+ouderkerk&source=bl&ots=S1WTMqhGwM&sig=uW3Y_I4TWXYZfuwDKrQiSFnlBv8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ygp6U_b2O8iwsQSF3YGYDQ&ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=will%20jan%20janse%20ouderkerk&f=false">1679</a>, he purchased a lot on <a href="../../streets.html#state">Yonker</a> Street in Albany from <a href="../c/janclute.html">Capt</a>ain Clute. At that time, Jan Janse was identified as a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">cooper</a> and the parcel was located next to his existing "cooper's shop."

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6401">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#6401">1684</a>, he was noted as being in default of his taxes. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">1689</a>, he was identified on an assessment roll as a "farmer in Marte Gerritse's <a href="../../na/castle.html">Com</a>pany." His Albany house was located on the north side of what became <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#jjo">1697</a>, his household (with four men and a woman) was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> (which included <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a>) next to that of his son and namesake. The household of son <a href="isoud6393.html">Isaac</a> was <a href="../../census1697.html#099">listed</a> on the census of Albany city. 

<p>In October 1712, Jan Ouderkirk appears to have filed a <a href="../../wills/willjjoud.html">will</a>. It named five sons and a daughter but no wife as his heirs. No probate date was given. This Albany patriarch may have died later that year.</p>
