<P>According to family-based <a href="http://sprague-database.org/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I172022&tree=SpragueProject">resources</a>, future Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Ostrander, Jr.</strong></a> was born in November 1754 and was a native of Rhinebeck. He <a href="../../res/guess.html">possibly</a> only was distantly (or not at all) related to the Albany area <a href="ostr.html">Ostranders</a>. DAR records <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EuEQBKv-cAwC&pg=PA220&lpg=PA220&dq=%22john+ostrander+jr.%22+albany&source=bl&ots=JgIljzkvPx&sig=VZgdMv_lgvaLgSEWPlEVz20itws&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pKQPUbm9NObo0gHh-YH4Bw&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20ostrander%20jr.%22%20albany&f=false">hold</a> that he was born in Albany in 1755. Finding no corroborating christening we are <a href="../qqqq.html">skeptical</a> and seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>!  He is sometimes confused with the same-named and older <a href="joost1478.html">Albany native</a>. This sketch organizes information about John Ostrander, Jr., Revolutionary war veteran and one-time <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County.

<p>By 1774, he had married <a href="../w/cawetz6619.html">Catherine Wetzel</a> (Hetzell) at the <a href="../ger.html">G</a>erman Presbyterian church at <a href="../w/cawetz6619.html#ec">East Camp</a> on Livingston Manor. A number of their children were christened at East Camp probably including his <a href="jojostr.html">son</a> and namesake. In March 1787, a daughter was <a href="../../drc.html">baptized</a> by them in Albany. However, the <a href="joost1478.html">other</a> John Ostrander was adding to his family at that time as well.

<p>His complete wartime <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">service</a> as an officer in the Revolutionary army was detailed in the <a href="../../or/pension/penjoostjr.html">pension application</a> his widow submitted thirty-seven years after his death. He was commissioned a lieutenant in the Continental army in February 1777 and served the overall cause in a number of ways until the end of the war. Initially a recruiter, he saw action at the Battle of Saratoga, in the Mohawk Valley, in Rhode Island, at Schoharie, and in the lower Hudson Valley. He almost died from smallpox during those times. His family followed him to Albany in 1777, then to Johnstown, and finally were settled in the mid-Hudson Valley. Financial concerns induced him to resign his army commission in 1781 and he finished out the war in service of New York State to be closer to his family.

<p>In 1784, these Ostranders removed permanently to Albany where they resided until John Jr's. passing. In Albany, this Revolutionary war veteran found success at least until illness overtook him. 

<p>In December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=CGjmifJkPLgC&pg=PA347&lpg=PA347&dq=pension+application+%22john+ostrander%22&source=bl&ots=pxVVQCOuB9&sig=WeO0N2df5NFkluHG-K4ziESkTw0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kEIWUab5IciW0QHyioDACQ&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=pension%20application%20%22john%20ostrander%20&f=false">1791</a>, he wrote to his <a href="../vr/svr3.html">assemblyman</a> inquiring about possible compensation for wartime service. 

<p>Family-based resources hold that by the mid-1780s, John Ostrander, Jr. had become the deputy to two Albany <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriffs</a>. In October 1792, the newspaper noted that he had been <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=%22and+John+Ostrander,+sheriff+of+the+city+and+county.%22&source=bl&ots=x7DUXPdPwq&sig=cN5KRCpYQNfC55oxZ2nbrTHHWT0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qhYVUfLXC8i10QHYqoDwDQ&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22and%20John%20Ostrander%2C%20sheriff%20of%20the%20city%20and%20county.%22&f=false">appointed</a> sheriff in place of <a href="../g/pegans.html">Peter Gansevoort, Jr.</a>, who had resigned. He was re-appointed three times and served until replaced in 1796.  
 
<p>In February 1788, John Ostrander, Jr. was listed among the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=33s4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA534&lpg=PA534&dq=%22ostrander,+john+jun%22&source=bl&ots=6jtrJfxKzQ&sig=N5PesID9pMplzvv6GTJxd-NJQAo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lpcKUaLLIvSC0QH7yoCQAg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22ostrander%2C%20john%20jun%22&f=false">subscribers</a> to the newly published <i>Laws of New York State</i>. At that time, his name appeared among those who were from Albany County. As he later, was identified as "Esq.", perhaps he had become a <a href="../../trades/law.html">legal</a> practicioner. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> to verify that connection.

<p>For more than a decade John Ostrander, Jr. was an Albany mainstay. His <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jojr">valued</a> moderately and his household consisted of three members in <a href="../../census1790.html#jojr">1790</a>. His home and holdings (he seems also to have owned lots on Wolf Street as well) on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> last appeared on the tax list in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>. Living with him (and assessed separately) was his <a href="jojostr.html">son</a>.


 <p>John Ostrander, Jr. filed his <a href="../../wills/willjoostjr.html">will</a> in January 1800. Suffering from consumption, he died shortly thereafter. On January 24, he was buried from his church. The will passed probate in Albany on February 19 leaving his real property and personal estate to his wife and children. Ostrander's passing occasioned <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QR82AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA128&lpg=PA128&dq=%22john+ostrander+jun%22+albany&source=bl&ots=PMRtTFylbK&sig=vQ8evoBJ3A5vt3PbnVPFUIOUuDg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=op0KUdiRK8Px0wG1pIEw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20ostrander%20jun%22%20albany&f=false">notice</a> in a Boston-based periodical. Later that year, Catherine was <a href="../../census1800.html#6619">listed</a> as head of the first ward household. His widow lived on at their Beaver Street address. She later re-located and survived until 1847.</p>
