<strong>Abraham Oake</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Oakey)was born about 1745. He was a prominent Albany surveyor and engineer during the first two decades of the nineteenth century. Perhaps he was the Abraham Oakey whose household was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> for the west ward of New York City. Otherwise, we seek defining information on his background and earlier life.

<p>About 1779, he married a woman named <a href="luoak.html">Lucy</a>. From the census, it seems that they raised a family. However, their names seem to be absent from the rolls of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward property was valued on the Albany assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#aboak">1800</a>, and for the next two censuses as well, his household was configured on the census.

<p>In 1800, he was <a href="http://www.albanycounty.com/departments/achor/world/wchap3.html">appointed</a> to be the first city engineer. At that time, the office may have included the title of city surveyor as well. Over the next two decades he produced a number of <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">maps</a> which form the basis for the "city engineer's maps" <a href="../../guide/histres.html#engineer">collection</a>.

<p>With the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>, Oake was listed as a surveyor living on Lutheran Street and then at 23 Sand Street. He was at that address in 1822. In 1830, an Abraham Oake was listed at a similar location and was called a clerk in the treasurer's office. Perhaps that would have been his son and namesake!  

<p>Abraham Oake died in New York in December 1833. He had lived eighty-five years. His widow passed in 1854 at the age of ninety.</p>
