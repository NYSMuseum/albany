<P>This Albany resident known as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Christopher Olly, Jr. </strong></a> (most <a href="../../res/sp.html">often</a> Oley) was born about 1773. Subsequent <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?rank=1&new=1&MSAV=0&msT=1&gss=angs-g&gsfn=Christopher&gsln=Oley&mswpn__ftp=albany&msbdy=1750&uidh=9w2&pcat=ROOT_CATEGORY&h=2327268&recoff=10+11&db=1840usfedcenancestry&indiv=1">records</a> will show that this individual lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and was alive at least into the 1840s. At this point, we have not definitively connected him to other early Albany <a href="joolly.html">Ollys</a>.

<p>He appears to have been married to Sara Van Antwerp. Two daughters named Eleanor were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in August 1799 and a year later. In June 1803, his wife was buried from the church. He later married Ann Baker who died in 1847.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#cool">1800</a>, his household was configured on the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a>. Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">rolls</a> valued his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a> and his shop on Orange Street during the first decade of the 19th century. The first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> did not reference this individual. However, the 1815 edition listed "Christopher Olney," a shipwright living on the Schenectady Turnpike. 

<p>Christopher Olly, Jr. <a href="http://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany10munsuoft#page/325/mode/2up">died</a> in January 1842 and was buried in the cemetery plot of the Third Presbyterian Church. He had lived sixty-nine years.</p>
