<strong>Eliaabeth Orr</strong></a> was born about 1775. She was the daughter of <a href="huorr1476.html">Hugh</a> and Isabella Orr. Her father was an aspiring merchant who had settled in Albany during the late 1770s.

<p>Her husband was <a href="../w/dawaters6821.html">David Waters</a>. She gave birth to a number of children before her husband's death in 1810. Her family members all received burial services from the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>.

<p>David Waters was a merchant whose store was a Market Street <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">landmark</a> for many years. Elizabeth's family <a href="../../census1790.html#6821">lived</a> in Albany's third ward next to the <a href="../../census1790.html#1476">home</a> of her widowed mother.

<P>Elizabeth was in her mid-thirties when her husband died. In that year, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> identified six slaves living in her home. She became head of their household listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> at 65 then 245 North Market Street. 


<p>In 1819, <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~usgenweb/special/alstine/">legal recourse</a> enabled her to secure payment of one of her late husband's debts.

<p>Having outlived most of her children, Eliabeth Orr Waters died in January 1839 at the age of sixty-four. Her will passed probate a month later.</p>
