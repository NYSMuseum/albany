<P>The first American member of this very large New York family <a href="http://www.brianblack.net/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I9N0L-JW&tree=bb">appears</a> to have been a Pieter Pietersen who came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the middle of the seventeenth century. We seek information on the family's European <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, path to America, and possible divergent branches. Spelled and 
        referred to variously (esp. Van Oostrande[r]), the story of the <a href="#sources"><strong>Ostrander</strong></a> 
        family of early Albany perhaps begins with the arrival of Kingston natives 
        <a href="joost.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../vd/elvdb5773.html">Elizabeth 
        Vandenbergh</a> Ostrander following their marriage in 1713. Their many 
        children established the Ostrander name in Albany and its environs.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#joost">1720</a>, Johannes was the only Ostrander named among the freeholders (Albany third ward) 
<a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyalbany/census/1720.html">of</a> greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, however, no Ostrander names were found among the freeholders of Albany or Rensselaerswyck.

<p>By the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">1760s</a>, the family had become prominent in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> and beyond with only a <a href="joost1478.html">single</a> presence within the city of Albany.

<p>The Ostrander family of greater Albany County served the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American cause</a> in a variety of ways during the 1770s and 80s. The two John Ostranders noted below were prominent in wartime activities. 

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, two John Ostranders (<a href="joost1478.html">one</a> had been city marshall and the <a href="joostranderjr.html">other</a> became sheriff) appeared on the city census while two more Ostrander families were living in surrounding <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. At the same time, that first Federal census configured more than <b>sixty</b> Ostrander-named households across New York State.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, recent widow <a href="../../census1800.html#6619">Catherine</a> stood out among the five Ostrander-named households in the city.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22ostrander+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22ostrander%20widow%22&f=false">1813</a>, 
        the first city directory identified four Ostrander named households living 
        in the city.</p>
      <p>From its origins in New Netherland, by the 1800s, the Ostrander family 
        was among the largest in New York State.</p>

          Family Association in Marceline, Mo, [Charlottesville, Va.]), has not 
          been examined at this time. Another printed source of <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/ostrander-descendants-of-pieter-pietersenoostrander-tryntjie-von-de-lande/oclc/32276441">record 
          appears</a> to be <i>Descendants of Pieter Pietersen/Oostrander & Tryntjie 
          von de Lande</i>, by Shirley A Krempel (Fort Collins, CO, 1994). We 
          have not encountered a hard copy of that work.
