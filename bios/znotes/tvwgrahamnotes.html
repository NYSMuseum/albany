      <p><a href="../g/thvwgraham8215.html">Theodorus Van Wyck Graham</a> was 
        born July 22, 1759, in Brinkerhoff, Dutchess County NY. His parents were 
        the Dr. Rev. Chauncey Graham and Elizabeth Van Wyck. His father was a 
        Presbyterian minister, physician and school teacher. It appears Theodorus 
        did not attend college. Presumably he was educated at his father's academy 
        in Fishkill, NY. In 1774 the Grahams moved to Stillwater, but shortly 
        returned to Brinkerhoff. 
      <p>In a letter written in Fishkill, New York dated November 14, 1777, Colonel 
        Henry B. Livingston requested that Governor Clinton promote certain officers 
        of the 4th New York Regiment. Theodorus was identified as a volunteer 
        member of the 4th New York Regiment who had been assigned the duties of 
        First Ensign effective October 1, 1777. He is noted in the papers of Governor 
        Clinton as recommended for promotion on November 25, 1777. From this we 
        know that Theodorus volunteered and served in the 4th New York Regiment 
        under Colonel Henry B. Livingston at least from October 1 through November 
        25, 1777. When he joined the 4th New York Regiment is uncertain, but presumably 
        it was between July 22, 1775 (his sixteenth birthday) and October 1, 1777. 
      <p>The 4th New York Regiment was part of the continental army, not the New 
        York militia. It has been said to have had the most eventful history of 
        any of the New York Regiments. It was called to the defense of Peekskill 
        on March 23, 1777, and by August 1777, joined General Gates in preparation 
        for what would be the Battles of Saratoga. The Battles of Saratoga consisted 
        of two main engagements, the first of these being the Battle of Freeman's 
        Farm and the second being the Battle of Bemis Heights. The 4th Regiment 
        fought with distinction in both engagements. 
      <p>The British were past Saratoga and advancing on their destination of 
        Albany, when on September 19, 1777, they ran into American forces in a 
        clearing in the woods at Freeman's Farm, 10 miles south of Saratoga. General 
        Benedict Arnold, commanding the left wing of the American forces, ordered 
        Colonel Daniel Morgan and his 400 sharpshooters to assault and harass 
        the British while they were still advancing through the woods in separate 
        columns. Morgan charged aggressively into British General Simon Fraser's 
        column and inflicted severe casualties before being forced back across 
        the field. Arnold then sent forward the brigades of Generals Enoch Poor 
        and Ebenezer Learned to support Morgan. The 4th New York Regiment was 
        fighting under Ebenezer Learned's Brigade. Although they had to relinquish 
        the field, the Americans halted Burgoyne's advance and inflicted disproportionate 
        losses on the British. The conservative Gates and Arnold had a heated 
        exchange about tactics and Gates relieved Arnold of his command. 
      <p>Burgoyne decided to wait for relief by Howe, but by early October realized 
        he was running out of time. The Battle of Bemis Heights took place on 
        October 7, 1777. Burgoyne planned to assault the American lines in three 
        columns and drive them from the field. The main assault was made by the 
        German Hessians under Major General Riedesel against the American forces 
        on Bemis Heights. General Benjamin Lincoln now commanded the division 
        of Poor's and Learned's brigades positioned on Bemis Heights. The 4th 
        Regiment was still serving under Learned's Brigade. The American's not 
        only inflicted disproportionate casualties on the British, but won the 
        field as well. G
      <p>general Burgoyne ultimately realizing the futility of further resistance 
        surrendered on October 17, 1777. Of the 7,000 British and Germans who 
        marched from Canada only 3,500 were fit for duty at the surrender. At 
        some point the 4th Regiment marched south, arriving at Fishkill a distance 
        of about 100 miles by November 14th. 
      <p>The available record suggests it is likely that Theodorus served in both 
        battles of Saratoga. Whether he continued to serve with the 4th Regiment 
        after November 14, 1777 is unclear. If he did, he served in some of the 
        most celebrated and trying campaigns of the Revolution. 
      <p>The 4th Regiment was with General Washington at White Marsh Pennsylvania 
        by December 2, 1777. The Battle of White Marsh was part the Philadelphia 
        campaign and was fought between December 5 and December 8, 1777. The battle, 
        which took the form of a series of skirmish actions, was the last major 
        engagement of 1777 between British and American forces. 
      <p>By Christmas, the 4th Regiment was at Valley Forge Pennsylvania, under 
        conditions so intolerable that Colonel Livingston was suggesting the Regiment 
        be disbanded if supplies could not quickly be found. None the less, they 
        remained at Valley Forge at least until May 14, 1778, when General Washington 
        ordered its commanding officer to apply for tents and "remove the men 
        from their huts" as they were sickly. 
      <p>On June 28, 1778, the 4th Regiment took part in the battle of Monmouth. 
        They next appear in White Plains, New York from where they were sent under 
        the Marquis de Lafayette to Rhode Island. The 4th Regiment was present 
        at the siege of Newport and subsequent battle of Rhode Island. Returning 
        in the fall of 1778 to the Hudson Valley, it marched to Albany and joined 
        General James Clinton. From Albany by way of Otsego Lake, down the Susquehanna, 
        the 4th Regiment, no longer under Coronal Livingston, joined General Sullivan. 
        It was involved in the expedition against the Iroquois and the action 
        at Newtown. The 4th Regiment rejoined the main army in Morristown for 
        the winter of 1779-80. It returned to the Highlands of the Hudson in the 
        following summer, and then proceeded to Fort Schuyler, where it was incorporated 
        with the 2d New York Regiment on the 1st January, 1781. 
      <p>At some point prior to 1780, he began serving as a Commissary of Issues 
        for the New York Provincial Congress. According to Helen Carpenter Graham, 
        he was later promoted to a Lieutenancy in the New York Militia. On August 
        14, 1783, the following appeared in the The Vermont Gazette or Freemen's 
        Depository: 
      <p>Ran away from the subscriber…a negro man named Quom … speaks Low Dutch 
        and English. Also, an apprentice lad, named Hercules Lent, about seventeen 
        years old…. Whoever secures the Negro, and delivers him, or gives word 
        to Theodorus V.W. Graham, Esq; in Albany, shall there receive TEN DOLLARS 
        reward, & all reasonable charges, or if delivered to the subscriber, the 
        said reward and charges shall be paid by [him]. 
      <p> THOMAS STORM Hopewell, Dutchess County, State of New York, July 28, 
        1783 
      <p>Thomas Storm was Theodorus' brother-in-law and a future candidate for 
        Lieutenant Governor of New York. It appears from the reference to Theodorus 
        as an esquire, that prior to 1783 Theodorus served several years under 
        a practicing lawyer, perhaps his uncle Zephaniah Platt. I have in my possession 
        an original legal document showing Theodorus was acting as an attorney 
        by 1784. 
      <p>Theodorus appears for the first time in the records of the First Presbyterian 
        Church of Albany in 1784. Although he served as one of the original incorporators 
        and trustees of the First Presbyterian Church of Albany (organized October 
        5, 1785), he did not officially become a member for another 29 years (November 
        18, 1814). He served as a trustee in 1785-1797, 1800-1803, 1810-1812, and 
        1817-1820. He ordained an Elder of the church on January 3, 1819 and remained 
        in that capacity until his death on July 6, 1822. 
      <p> Perhaps the dress of Magdalena (Ten Broeck) Graham described in the 
        book Social New York under the Georges as a gown of gauze embroidered 
        in silver with an under dress of white satin was her wedding dress. At 
        the time of the wedding, her father, a wealthy merchant and noted Revolutionary 
        leader, was serving as the Sheriff of Albany County. Among her prominent 
        and wealthy family were her Uncles Leonard Gansevoort, Esq. and General 
        Peter Gansevoort. 
      <p>There were some earlier connections between Theodorus' family and Magdalena's 
        family. For example, Magdalena's father John Ten Broeck and uncle Leonard 
        Gansevoort served with Theodous's uncles Zephaniah Platt and his grandfather 
        Theodorus Van Wyck in the Third Provincial Congress held in New York between 
        May and June of 1776. They were also involved in the various committees 
        for detecting conspiracies etc that served as the Revolutionary Government 
        of New York. 
      <p>Theodorus, along with many prominent persons, is listed as a subscriber 
        to The Vision of Columbus a poem in nine books, by Joel Barlow, Esq. (Hartford 
        1787). 
      <p>Theodorus and Magdalena's first child, John Ten Broeck Graham was born 
        in Albany of July 24, 1787. Three months later, on September 25, 1787, 
        Theodorus was first elected to public office as an Assistant to the Albany 
        Common Counsel. Theodorus was 28 years old at the time, and his election 
        was undoubtedly help by his wife's influential family. He would remain 
        a resident of the Second Ward until sometime after the 1790 census. During 
        this period he began what appears to have been a life long practice of 
        buying and selling real estate. 
      <p>Within a year his life long association with Federalist politics was 
        reflected in the National Press, where it was reported: 
      <p>When news of the adoption of the constitution, by the State of Virginia, 
        arrived here, the federal party caused the bells to be rung; walked up 
        to the fort in procession; had ten guns fired with three huzzas between 
        each shot. That same evening the antifederal party had a meeting, and 
        concluded on walking to the fort in procession the next morning, to burn 
        the constitution, which they put into execution about eight o'clock. About 
        eleven both parties joined to celebrate independency; walked in procession 
        to the fort and had thirteen canon fired; after which the federal party, 
        with a few of the other, dined at Mr. Lews's; the principal part of the 
        anti-federal party went to Mr. Hilton's where they had a flag displayed, 
        and were firing guns and huzzaing all the forepart of the day. There were 
        a few light horse under the command of Dirck Ten Broeck, esquire, and 
        the artillery company under arms, who when they were dismissed at twelve, 
        had orders to be on parade at five, in order to spend the afternoon, in 
        celebrating independency, as they had the morning-before five o'clock, 
        the federal party agreed to spend the remainder of the day in rejoicing 
        on account of the adoption of the constitution by ten states; when the 
        troops paraded, they were informed of the intentions of the party, and 
        after Abraham G. Lansing, Esquire, had the artillery company dismissed 
        (for he could not consistent with his political sentiments rejoice with 
        them) Major Compton ordered all who were federal to parade, whenevery 
        man under arms paraded except three, who joined the anti-federalists at 
        Mr. Hilton's. 
      <p>The federalists began their maneuvers by walking through the city, carrying 
        a small field piece and firing it at different parts of town they turned 
        up the lane which leads from Court to Green Street, intending to go past 
        Mr. Hilton's; but as soon as they entered the street a violent engagement 
        ensued … clubs and bricks were used on both side - the light horse were 
        beat back, and went round the block to the other end of the street, where 
        they joined the action. It was expected some lives would have been lost, 
        for the artillery made use of bayonets; the federal party being most powerful, 
        forced into the house and made prisoners of those who had not escaped. 
        Those most hurt in the engagement are, Alderman T.V.W. Graham, and Dirk 
        Ten Broeck …. 
      <p>The Independent Gazeteer, 7-19-1788 (extract of a letter from Albany, 
        July 6). Although his injuries were serious, he appears to have recovered 
        quickly. On September 2, 1788, Theodorus was replaced on a committee of 
        the Common Counsel as he was leaving Albany. 
      <p>He was elected Alderman for the Second Ward on 1788. It was reported 
        that on July 16th, he applied to the Court of Oyer and Terminer, Justice 
        Hobart presiding, to be permitted to associate with them, in consequence 
        of his qualification in the office of alderman, certificates of which 
        he produced to the court. The mayor, [John Lansing Jr] pleaded difficulty 
        in that Mr. Marselis continued to exercise the same office, and that by 
        law Mr. Graham could not be admitted to the office until Mr. Marselis 
        was ousted. The court requested evidence of such law, and when none was 
        produced held that that Mr. Graham was the legal Alderman; and Mr. Marselis 
        had no right to a seat there, and that any acts of the court with Mr. 
        Marselis would be coram non judice. 
      <p>Theodorus was a member of the NY Law Book Patrons of 1792, 
      <p>Paper date: Albany, 9-6-1792, Theodorus, Col. Talbot and Maj. North appointed 
        the commissioners to contract for building bridges and improvement of 
        roads in the Western District. 
      <p>Letter dated April 18, 1792 (http://www.columbia.edu/cu/libararies/inside/working/jay) 
        provides in part: 
      <p>From The Albany Committee of Correspondence Albany, 18 April 1792 Sir, 
        Our adversaries in the election, finding that their cause grows desperate, 
        have descended to misrepresentations of various kinds to promote the re-election 
        of Governor Clinton … [including] that Mr. Jay and his friends at New 
        York have determined to give up their opposition to Mr. Clinton's reelection 
        …. We are Sir, Your obedient Servants, James Caldwell Cornelius Glen Daniel 
        hale Leonard Gansevoort, Jun. Philip S. Van Rensselaer Theodorus V.W. 
        Graham Abraham Ten Broeck Dirk Ten Broeck John D.P. Douw Joseph Newlands 
        Samuel Stringer William Van Ingen Barent Van Allen 
      <p>On June 6, 1792, The Diary or Loudon's Register reprinted the legal opinion 
        of Stephen Lush, T.V.W. Graham and Abraham Van Veighten issued May 24, 
        1792 to the legislature concluding that Richard R. Smith continued as 
        the Sheriff of Otsego County until a new Sheriff was sworn in and therefore, 
        the ballots and poll lists returned by him were valid. Had the votes been 
        counted, John Jay would have defeated George Clinton in the Governor's 
        race. The Anti-federalists controlled the State assembly and ruled to 
        the contrary, immediately burning the ballots to hide the evidence of 
        their malfeasance. 
      <p>In June, 1792, Theodorus, Thomas Hun, Johannes Deitz, Jacob Hochstrasser, 
        William North and Jellis A. Fonda were elected to represent the County 
        of Albany in the State Assembly. That fall, Chancellor Kent and his wife 
        where making a tour up the Hudson and stayed a while with Theodorus. Mrs. 
        Kent was Theodorus' cousin.

        <p>The Albany Centinel, 4-22-1803: At a meeting of Federal Republican 
          Citizens of Albany, more respectable and numerous than has appeared 
          in this city on any similar occasion convened at the City Tavern, on 
          Tuesday, the 22nd day of March, 1803… Resolved .. Stephen Luh, Esquire,

          this city… [long list of names] T.V.W. Graham … Samuel Stringer, Chairman,

        <p>The Albany Centinel, 4-6-1804: The following Gentlemen have been appointed 
          by the Common Council, Inspectors at the ensuing election, for this 
          city… T.V.W. Graham, Third Ward John Binkerhoff Peter Beeckman 
        <p>The Albany Centinel, 4-10-1804: At a meeting of the General Committee, 
          the following persons were appointed a Committee of Correspondence. 
          … Abm. V. Vechten … Abraham Hun …Hon. P. Schuler … T.V.W. Graham…. 
        <p>By April of 1804, the controversy between Burr and Hamilton had become 
          public with Dr. Cooper alleging that: 
        <p>Gen. Hamilton and Judge Kent have declared in substance, that they 
          look upon Mr. Burr to be a dangerous man, and one ought not to be trusted 
          with the reins of government. … With respect to Judge Kent's declaration 
          I have only to refer to Theodorus V. W. Graham Esq. and Mr. James Kane 
          … whose veracity I trust will not be impeached, but should the fact 
          escape their recollection, I am not in want of other evidence…. 
        <p>Interestingly, Burr never challenged Kent to a duel, but perhaps because 
          of long running disputes with Hamilton and the fact that Hamilton presented 
          an obstacle to Burr's ambitions, he pursued a duel with Hamilton despite 
          Hamilton providing him with face saving opportunities to avoid blood 
          shed. Burr's actions could be viewed as thinly veiled act of premeditated 
          murder to settle old scores and eliminate a rival. T

        <p>The New York Evening Post, 7-24-1818 Obituary of John T.B. Graham 
        <p>According to a notice of litigation over a certain lot in the second 
          ward of Albany published in the New-York Evening Post on December 8, 
          1818, the eastern boundary of the disputed lot was a "lot now or lately" 
          owned by Theodorus VW Graham, the southern boundary was Elk Street and 
          the northern boundary was Fox street, and the Western boundarywas a 
          lot owned by the City. This may be the location of TVW's residence when 
          he lived in the second ward (dates) or it may simply be an investment 
          property.
