<P>According to traditional sources, one-time Albany resident <a href="#sources">Samuel Hooker</a> was born in May 1745. He was the son of John and Mary Partridge Hooker of Medway, Massachusetts. We strive to not confuse him with a <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/hooker.html">number</a> of more prominent, same-named contemporaries.

<p>This individual generally was called a carpenter and also a builder. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on his training and his credits.

<p>In July 1766, Samuel married Rachel Hines in Rutland, Massachusetts. <a href="phhooker.html">Philip Hooker</a> was their eldest son. The marriage produced more than six children - most (if not all) of them christened in Massachusetts churches.

<p>Samuel Hooker is said to have brought his family to live in Albany in 1772. However, solid evidence has not placed him in the city until much later. Thirty years-old at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, we have not yet uncovered <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">info</a>rmation on his wartime <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">rec</a>ord. 

<p>Early in November 1787, transplanted <a href="../../yankinv.html">yankee</a> Samuel Hooker was among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA302&lpg=PA302&dq=%22samuel+hooker%22&source=bl&ots=0TlkwnRrEo&sig=XYjGaeEYFZrFh_pAnL0QxihlrDc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_zCQT_DtIIHG6AH-5NizBA&ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20hooker%22&f=false">instructed</a> to appraise the building at the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> by the Albany corporation. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on a possible earlier time in Albany.

<p>The Albany assessment of <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8524">1788</a> valued the house and property of Samuel Hooker on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">southside</a> of the booming post-war community. Two years later, the <a href="../../census1790.html#saho">census</a> counted nine people (including three men) in Samuel's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home.

<p><a href="../../res/guess.html#">S</a>ometime thereafter, he removed his family to the west leaving Philip Hooker behind in Albany. Samuel is <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/m-m-moses-mears-bagg/the-pioneers-of-utica--being-sketches-of-its-inhabitants-and-its-institutions--gga/page-8-the-pioneers-of-utica--being-sketches-of-its-inhabitants-and-its-institutions--gga.shtml">said</a> to have settled in Utica. 

<p>In 1797, he (with his son John) built a <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=donevanell&id=I36291">landmark</a> house in Utica on behalf of the Holland Land Company. Perhaps, about 1798, Dr. Alexander Coventry <a href="http://www.uticalandmarks.org/News/hooker%20journal.pdf">visited</a> him there at "York House" where he ate oysters supplied by "Mr. Sam Hooker."

<p>Samuel Hooker was counted among the <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/m-m-moses-mears-bagg/the-pioneers-of-utica--being-sketches-of-its-inhabitants-and-its-institutions--gga/page-8-the-pioneers-of-utica--being-sketches-of-its-inhabitants-and-its-institutions--gga.shtml">pioneers</a> of Utica.

<p>In 1803, he was among the first <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=7xszAQAAIAAJ&q=Samuel+Hooker&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6#v=snippet&q=Samuel%20Hooker&f=false"">subscribers</a> and then a vestryman and warden of Trinity church in Utica.

<p>In 1810, he was among the stockholders of the newly <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9INZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=%22samuel+hooker%22+utica&source=bl&ots=mCGKKRj9IT&sig=lWAzY6ooV3nFvbx65FOd12JdRBo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ejeQT-XNM4bN6QHvtMSdBA&ved=0CEwQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20hooker%22%20utica&f=false">incorporated</a> Utica glass manufacturing company."
 
<p>Samuel Hooker died in October 1832 and was buried in Utica.</p>
