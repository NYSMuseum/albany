<P>According to community-based resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Hunt</strong></a> was born in London. This (the Albany resident) individual has been encountered under <a href="../../res/sp.html">various</a> spellings (also Stout, Hont, Hout) of his name. Other William Hunts may have been living in North America at that time as well.

<p>In May 1698, the name of enlisted man "William Hunt" appeared on a payroll list for Captain <a href="../w/jaweems.html">Weems</a>'s <a href="../../garrison.html">company</a> stationed at the Albany <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>. He was due something over two pounds. 

<p>In October 1700, William "Stout" married American born <a href="../vs/geervschoon5886.html">Geertruy Van Schoonhoven</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The groom was said to have been a single man born in London, England. Their first child was  christened in January 1701. By 1713, five of their children had been baptized at the Albany church. Perhaps, the last one was christened in New York City. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#wmhu">1709</a>, his first ward property was located in the midst of the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside soldier enclave and was accorded a token assessment.

<p>In May 1711, William Hunt was made a <a href="../../sources.html#bf">freeman</a> of New York City and was identified as a victualler.

<p>Was this individual the same William Hunt who witnessed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wBsXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22william+hunt%22+sackett&source=bl&ots=ZGSXPtwcQY&sig=fS3698QJKsAZ4h1TIQv-YiAWXeU&hl=en&ei=P_NFTJmNKcL6lwffu_TrAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22william%20hunt%22%20sackett&f=false">will</a> in Dutchess County in 1744?

<p>A number of same-named individuals seem to be at risk in the colonies during his lifetime. At this point, the life of the Albany William Hunt includes too many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. We have identified this individual as "William Hunt" from the 1709 assessment roll although <a href="../../res/sp.html">varied forms</a> of his name have been encountered. Of course, origins and end of life <a href="../qqqq.html">information</a> would be of value.
