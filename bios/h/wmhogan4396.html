<P><a href="#sources"><b>William Hogan</b></a> was born in Ireland about 1670. He emigrated to America before 1700. He was the patriarch of the Hogan 
<a href="hogan.html">family</a> of early Albany.</p>


<p>In September 1692, he married innkeeper's daughter <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">Martina Becker</a> in the Albany Dutch church. Over the next decade, five children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1714, he contributed to the building of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> English church.</p>

<p>William Hogan probably came to Albany as a soldier and served in the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> at the Albany fort. Following his marriage, he became an  innkeeper - possibly in partnership with his <a href="../b/jjbecker6030.html">father-in-law</a>. He set down permanent roots in Albany. Over the next decades, he was a <a href="../../census1697.html#026">prominent</a> Albany <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4396">personage</a> - serving as juror, firemaster, assessor, constable, and high constable. He also found work as a surveyor. <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4396">Assessment</a> rolls for the early 1700s show him to be a quite wealthy resident who owned additional buildings in the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a>. He belonged to the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and several times joined with his neighbors in pledging <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4396">allegiance</a> to the Protestant King of England.</p>

<p>However, in 1699 and again in 1701, he was identified as one of those cited <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> without possessing the <a href="../../nat.html">freedom</a> of the city.</p> 

<p>William and Martina filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">joint will</a> in 1732. It named seven surviving children, six grandchildren, and a number of slaves who were bequeathed to their now adult children. Hogan lost his wife in 1736. He died sometime before April 4, 1739 when the will passed probate.</p>
