<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Harsen</b></a> was born in February 1738. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="beharsen8347.html">Bernardus</a> and <a href="../p/capruyn.html">Catharina Pruyn</a> Harsen.</p>

<p>In 1759, he was named constable in the second ward. The next year, he served as firemaster. As a young man, he was identified as a gunsmith who kept a home and shop at Niagara where he was a client of Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>. He was known on the frontier as a smith and trader whose principal clients were Indians.</p>

<p>In June 1764, he married Albany native <a href="../g/algroesbeck3258.html">Alida Groesbeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Two years later, he took charge of a pew in the church that formerly had belonged to his father. The marriage produced at least seven children. But only the first born was baptized in Albany.</p>

<p>In 1767, he was listed on the Albany assessment roll under his mother's second ward home. Sometime afterward, he moved his large family to the far West where he became a silversmith and one of the pioneer settlers of what became Michigan. By 1778, he had <a href="http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=L0511.htm">settled</a> on an island in the St. Clair River in Michigan. At different times, he also lived in Detroit.</p>

<p>Jacob Harsen <a href="http://www.harsensislandbridge.info/toallagencies.php">died</a> on Harsen's Island in the spring of 1802. He was one of a number of early Albany tradesmen who settled near Lake Michigan before the American Revolution. His children became prominent residents of the region. </p>
