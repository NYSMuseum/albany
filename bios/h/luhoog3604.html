<strong>Lucas Hooghkerk</strong></a> was born in April 1712. He was the son of <a href="luhooghkerk3603.html">Lucas Hoogkerk</a> and his second wife, the widow <a href="../m/jumarselis741.html">Judik Marselis</a> Hooghkerk. He grew up as the youngest child in a large combined family on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. He was known as "Lucas Hooghkerk, Jr."

<p>In August 1734, he married Albany native  <a href="../f/refonda3840.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1750, nine children had been christened in Albany. However, Lucas was left a widower with the death of Rebecca in November 1750.

<p>Beginning in 1743, his "lime kiln" was referenced in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a>. His father had died in 1741 - leaving him in charge of the enterprise.

<p>Lucas Jr. followed his father as a brickmaker. In <a href="../b/jobrooks346.html">1733</a>, his brickyard on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallow's Hill</a> was referenced in a real estate transaction. Perhaps his identification on the census of Albany householders in <a href="../../census1756.html#168">1756</a> was meant to be interpreted as "brickmaker" rather than what appears as "britchesmaker." (But perhaps not!)

 In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3604">1742</a> and again in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3604">1763</a>, his name appeared on lists of Albany freeholders. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his first ward holdings were accorded moderate assessments. His almost grown son, <a href="johooghkerk3600.html">John</a>, was named on the tax list along with the father.  But, in 1779, the Albany assessment rolls no longer valued Lucas Hooghkerk's properties. 

<p>On a number of occasions into the 1770s, his accounts were paid from the city treasury. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1759">1759</a> and again in 1765, he was appointed  <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the first ward.  In March 1769, he was among a number of people who were deeded an unlocated lot in the city. 


<p>Expected to turn seventy-one in 1783, Lucas Hooghkerk, Jr. probably did not survive the end of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>.</p>
