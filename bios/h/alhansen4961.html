<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Albert Hansen</strong></a> was born in July 1751. He was a younger son of Albany natives <a href="ishansen4952.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../b/mabradt4266.html">Maria Bradt</a> Hansen. His father died in 1758 and his mother raised a large family their modest third ward home. <a href="behansen4963.html">T</a>wo brothers also became Albany residents. Widow Hansen died in 1790.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1773">1773</a>, he was named constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. The following May, he was paid for attending the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> for three days.

<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../econ/comec.html">work</a> record.

<p>In December 1778, Albert married <a href="../../res/guess.html">a</a> somewhat older <a href="enghansen.html">Engeltie Hansen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1783, two daughters were christened at the church where he was a contributor.

<p>Even though his name did not appear in the minutes of Albany's wartime organizations, we expect to find Revolutionary war-related information for this individual. Afterward, he was alotted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4961">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p> In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1787">1787</a>, he served as chimney viewer for the second ward.

<p>These Hansens lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> either <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4266">with</a> or near Albert's mother and brothers. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4961">1788</a>, Albert's second ward home was valued moderately on the assessment roll.  In <a href="../../census1790.html#4961">1790</a>, his household included five people. A decade later, three men and a young woman were <a href="../../census1800.html#4961">living</a> in his home.

<p>In <a href="http://fultonhistory.com/newspapers%20Disk3/Albany%20NY%20Evening%20Journal/Albany%20NY%20Centinel%201804.pdf/Albany%20NY%20Centinel%201804%20-%200178.pdf">1804</a>, he joined in a nominating petition supporting a Republican candidate for lieutenant governor. In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#4961">1808</a>, he was among those invited to the funeral of a neighbor.

<p>Albert Hansen <a href="../qqqq.html">probably</a> died shortly thereafter. </p>
