<strong>William Hogan, Jr.</strong></a> was born just before or after 1700. He was the son of Irish-born <a href="wmhogan4396.html">William Hogan</a> (the patriarch) and his wife, Albany native <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">Martina Becker</a>. His christening was not recorded in the records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He grew up at his father's Albany inn and has been known as "William Hogan, Jr." to differentiate him from his father and <a href="wmhogan4398.html">nephew</a>.  

<p>In February 1732, he married <a href="../d/pidouw2166.html">Pietertje Douw</a> at the Dutch church in Catskill. By 1748, the marriage had produced four children. Later that year, he was <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">named</a> as an heir and co-executor of his parents' estate. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1738">1738</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4397">1742</a> and again in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4397">1763</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders. 

<p>In May 1762, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willcobeekman.html">will</a> of his neighbor, Neeltie Van Vechten. William Hogan, Jr. probably was dead by 1766, when his <a href="../d/pidouw2166.html">widow</a> was named as the owner of their first ward property.</p>
