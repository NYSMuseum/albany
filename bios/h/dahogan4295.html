<P><a href="#sources"><b>Daniel Hogan</b></a> was born in March 1695. He was the son of Irish -born Albany innkeeper <a href="wmhogan4396.html">William Hogan</a> and his wife, <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">Martina Becker</a> Hogan.</p>


<p>Like his father, he became a resident of Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>, served as constable and then high constable. In 1724, he was elected assistant alderman for the first ward.</p>

<p>Daniel Hogan probably did not marry. However, he may have fathered Rachel Beekman's illegitimate daughter who was baptized on October 3, 1730. Daniel Hogan's child was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in January 1732. In September of that year, he was named heir and co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">joint will</a> filed by his parents.</p>
