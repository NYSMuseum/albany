<P>According to a family <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">bible</a>, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Engeltie Hansen</strong></a> was born in New York in July 1743. She would have been the last of two daughters of <a href="johansen4955.html">Hans Jr.</a> and Manhattan resident Margarita Kip Hansen. Her mother died in August 1745 when Engeltie was just two.

<p>Perhaps, her father became more of a New York City <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=%22burghers+and+freemen%22&source=web&ots=W4zL6h-NDG&sig=jgYAaGL-vhXYjpAzBa2ydE2OjSg#v=onepage&q&f=false">resident</a> following the passing of Engeltie's mother.

<p>At this point, we are <a href="../../res/guess.html">considering</a> that she married Albany native <a href="alhansen4961.html">Albert Hansen</a> in December 1778 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A month earlier and in 1783, two daughters were christened there with the names of their grandmothers.

<p>These Hansens made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4961">1790</a>, Engeltie seems to have accounted for in the Pearl Street household. But according to the household enumeration, fifty-seven-year-old Engeltie would have been dead in <a href="../../census1800.html#4961">1800</a>. Their home was not listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> which began in 1813. 

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> defining information on the <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and later life of this Engeltie Hansen </p>
