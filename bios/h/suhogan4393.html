<strong>Susanna Hogan</strong></a> was born in February 1740. She was the daughter of <a href="juhogan4372.html">Jurrian</a> and <a href="../b/mabeekman3874.html">Maria Beekman</a> Hogan. She grew up as part of a large family in a merchant's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In December 1763, she married <a href="../d/jodgarmo934.html">John De Garmo</a>. She was identified as his wife in the <a href="../../wills/willjuhogan.html">will</a> filed by her parents in May 1764. However, De Garmo may have died before the arrival of any children.  In November 1774, she married widower <a href="../vv/epvvechten2454.html">Ephraim Van Vechten</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their only child was born in 1779.

<p>These Van Vechtens <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">lived</a> on Court Street where Ephraim was a well-known Albany personage through the end of the century. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2454">1790</a>, their home included three females and a slave. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1800</a>, Susanna and her husband were listed on the census with only a slave in their household.

<p>Ephraim Van Vechten died in November 1802. 

<p>Death information for Susanna Hogan De Garmo Van Vechten is less certain.</p>
