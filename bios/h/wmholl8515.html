<P>Spelled and referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Holling</strong></a> (aka Hellen/Hellingh) was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> as "William Halyaigh" on June 9, 1723. Parents listed were Willem and Jenne - although probably a generation or more away from antecedents <a href="wmhollie6048.html">William</a> and <a href="../s/jseeley.html">Jenny Seely</a> Hollie. Named sponsors were <a href="edholland.html">Edward Holland</a> and <a href="#andp">Anna De Peyster</a> - young representatives of Albany's newcomer upper class.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#8515">1742</a>, the name "Willing Helling" appeared on a list of freeholders in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> next to that of Hendrick Hallenbeck - perhaps his future father or brother-in-law.

<p>His wife was <a href="elhallenbeck.html">Elizabeth Halenbeek</a>. At least four children were christened by them (Hellen) between 1749 and 1757.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#186">1756</a>, his name appeared on a census of Albany householders made by the British army. At that time, his family occupied one room in that house.

<p>After that, references have not been encountered in the community-based record. Perhaps, he was the "Willem Hellen" whose property was valued on the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">H</a>alfmoon assessment rolls during the mid-<a href="../../sources.html#uny">1760s</a>.
 
<p>With unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">qu</a>estions on the life of this <a href="../../res/sp.html">William Holling</a>, we move on for now.</p>
