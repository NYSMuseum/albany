<strong>Daniel Hewson</strong></a> was born during the early 1700s. This Albany patriarch was known as Daniel Hewson/Huson/Hughsen, Sr. We seek information on his background and early life.</P>

<p>In November 1724, Daniel "Hoioson" married "Jane Pauwel" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Between 1733 to 1736, three children were christened in the church with the mother's name given as Mary. In 1736 and 1741, two children were buried in the churchyard. However, from the 1730s on, he was more closely associated with <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church where Daniel Sr. was a <a href="../../coerec1771.html#8622">member</a>, baptism sponsor, and later a church warden.

 <P>Daniel Hewson was a <a href="../../census1756.html#169">shoemaker</a> whose named began appearing on Albany rolls during the 1730s when references were made ot his property on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>. However, his name did not appear on freeholder's lists until <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#8622">1763</a>. Perhaps, his holdings were of marginal value until then.  In 1766, he was listed on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> along with his <a href="dahewson8623.html">son</a> and namesake. The following year, his house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was accorded a modest assessment.</p>

<p>As late as 1771, his account was paid by the Albany government. In 1774, he was appointed to the city watch. Into his seventies, during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>, he should have been too old for active service.  However, in 1779, "Daniel Huston, Sr." and "Daniel Jr." as well were <a href="../../sources.html#cp">identified</a> as soldiers in Captain John Price's <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.  Afterwards, perhaps he was the Daniel Hewson who was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8622">bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany city militia regiment.

<p>He may have been one of the Daniel Hewsons who property was valued on the first ward assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8622">1788</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the households of two "Daniel Hewsons" were configured on the Albany census for the first ward. We seek more definitive information on his passing.</p>
