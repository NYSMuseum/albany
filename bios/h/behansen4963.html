<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Benjamin Hansen</strong></a> was born in September 1747. He was the son of <a href="ishansen4952.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../b/mabradt4266.html">Maria Bradt</a> Hansen. He was named for his mother's father, <a href="../b/bebradt4213.html">Benjamin Bradt</a> and grew up a middle child of a large family in a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home while his grandfather's <a href="../../census1756.html#37">home</a> was next door. His father died in 1758. 

<p>In September <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, this shoemaker's son was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In December 1778, his account was paid by the city government.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war years</a>, he was in his twenties and his name was found on a roster of the first regiment of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. However, he was not among those accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> under the Albany regiment. We <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">ex</a>pect to find more information on his wartime activities.

<p>This individual probably did not marry but was included as the householder of record in the second ward on community surveys beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4963">1788</a>.  His mother died in 1790. By <a href="../../census1800.html#4963">1800</a>, he was listed on the census with three other age cohorts and an adolescent boy. 

<p>In March 1794, he probably was the Benjamin Hansen who was identified as the surviving <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=RuATAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA535&lpg=PA535&dq=%22benjamin+hansen%22+albany&source=bl&ots=3Wihf1w-5Q&sig=ZKlEbpD9HiyjWXUzypm2W0ynQvQ&hl=en&ei=x5e4S4vdH8SBlAepg9WVCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22benjamin%20hansen%22%20albany&f=false">executor</a> of the estate of the late Teunis Slingerland in a payment-related law enacted by the State legislature. Perhaps the deceased was the father-in-law of his brother <a href="johansen4980.html">John</a>. 

<p>In January 1808, he was among those invited to the <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#4963">funeral</a> of a third ward neighbor.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22hansen&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hansen&f=false">1813</a> and thru 1817, city directories listed his home at 20 <a href="../../streets.html#steuben">Steuben Street</a> and his occupation as <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a>.


<p>A Benjamin Hansen, Jr. (<font size=-1>probably not this individual</font size>) married in 1805 and lived for many years. However, this Albany shoemaker has not yet been found in the community-based record examined so far after 1817.</p>
