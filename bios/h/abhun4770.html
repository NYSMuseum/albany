<strong>Abraham Hun</strong></a> was born February 1768. He was the son of <a href="thjhun4781.html">Thomas J.</a> and <a href="../w/elwendell2860.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> Hun. He grew up in a small family in the <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">landmark</a> homes of a prominent Albany businessman and landholder. His only <a href="anhun4771.html">sibling</a> married Rev. John Bassett.

<p>Abraham Hun <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=e6egAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA722&lpg=RA1-PA722&dq=%22abraham+hun%22+columbia&source=bl&ots=fgCFD5xcVy&sig=gDGazqiec9T95rFOJpN56jsvS9Y&hl=en&ei=wl0NS9f7L8yjlAff_ZTTCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA0Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20hun%22%20columbia&f=false">graduated</a> from Columbia College in 1786 and received an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=c_kRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22abraham+hun%22+columbia&source=bl&ots=hA8cVt6gd8&sig=N0J7V0-qyGcgnMe953BthSt5lN4&hl=en&ei=0FsNS4j3IIeplAfQw9SRBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CCAQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=hun&f=false">A.M.</a> in 1789. He was the college <a href="http://tera-3.ul.cs.cmu.edu/NASD/4a7f1db4-5792-415c-be79-266f41eef20a/upgrade-archive-06-14-2007/data/tmp/9.sgml">chum</a> of De Witt Clinton.

Hun became an <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a> (admittted 1791) - practicing law in Albany in partnership with <a href="../w/rewesterlo6868.html">Rensselaer Westerlo</a>.  The <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Patroon</a> was among their <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA98&lpg=PA98&dq=%22abraham+hun%22+columbia&source=bl&ots=aLJIHkNauH&sig=xieKU1cFxqfIJt_Kf70AKP5ED44&hl=en&ei=UtUKS63aFsizlAediaCFBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20hun%22%20columbia&f=false">clients</a>.

<p>In September 1796, Abraham was twenty-eight when he married his younger Market Street neighbor <a href="../g/magansevoort4695.html">Maria Gansevoort</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage may have produced five children.

 
<p>These Huns seemed to have <a href="../../census1800.html#4781">lived</a> in his father's large third ward home. By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, however, his father was dead and Abraham had become the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA24&lpg=PA24&dq=%22abraham+hun%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0SnpppRlzr&sig=CjInQwKSbk4dqsjZMzndJxrvnq0&hl=en&ei=eGUNS7bYJsfDlAeGrJ2kBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20hun%22%20albany&f=false">head</a> of that Market Street household. 

<p>In 1792, he was among the petitioners to incorporate the <a href="../../org/albanylib.html">Albany Library</a>. He was for a time an officer in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. He was involved in a number of community-based businesses and <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/hun.html">owned</a> a large farm and summer home on the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">No</a>rmanskill later called "Buena Vista."

<p>By the early 1800s, <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/hun.html">he</a> had erected a <a href="../../dead.html">burial</a> vault above the city on Chestnut Street between Hawk and Dove. Family members interred there were removed to the farm and then to Albany Rural Cemetery.

<p>Abraham Hun filed a <a href="../../wills/willabhun4770.html">will</a> in September 1811. It named his wife and two children as his heirs. He died of tuberculosis in January 1812 just shy of his forty-fourth birthday. His widow died from the same disease in October 1813.
