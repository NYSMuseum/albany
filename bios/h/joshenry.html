<strong>Joseph Henry</strong></a> was born in Albany in December 1797. He was the son of Scottish emigres-turned-Albany residents <a href="wmhenry8429.html">William</a> and <a href="../a/analex8409.html">Ann Alexander</a> Henry. This younger son of a marginal <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#bottom">southside</a> family was sent to live with his grandparents in rural Saratoga County even before his father died in 1811.
   
<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=97UaAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22joseph+henry%22#PPA4,M1">Galway</a>, he received a basic education and was placed in a local store at age ten to learn business. He also was <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been apprenticed to learn the trades of the watchmaker and jeweler.

<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/joshenry1829.jpg" align=left border=0 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200 alt="Joseph Henry in 1829"></a>He returned to Albany when he was fifteen already having displayed the intellect and curiosity of a scholar. He moved into the South Pearl Street <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#bottom">home</a> of his widowed mother.

<p>He also found work as a tutor and surveyor. Interested in drama, he was an amateur actor. 

<p>In 1826, he was appointed to the faculty at his alma mater, the Albany Academy.

<p>[ More to <a href="../../inprog.html">follow</a> but please understand that the extraordinary career of this Albany boy is <a href="../../criteria.html">mostly beyond</a> the scope of our study! ]

<p>In May 1830, he married Harriet Alexander in Schenectady. She was  the niece of his mother. They had four children. 

<p>In 1830, he was listed as a professor at the Academy on Fayette Street in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>. His widowed mother also lived at that address. 

<p>In 1832, he left Albany for Princeton University. In 1846, he was appointed secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.
 
<p>Joseph Henry died in Washington, DC in May 1878.

<p>Although among the most notable of native sons who became reknowned after they left Albany, his story is most significant in an early Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">context</a> as a case of extreme upward mobility - laborer's son to world-class scientist!</p>
