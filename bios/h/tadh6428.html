<strong>Takel Dirckse</strong></a> probably was born about 1650. In 1670, <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> records identified him as the "head farmer" of the Van Rensselaers who had been accused of beating a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> tenant. He also ws known by the surname "Heemstraat" or also as "Hemstradt".

<p>He was married to a woman named Maria and was the father of several children.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#6428">1679</a>, he was listed among the Albany householders. Two years later, he was called an Albany burgher and was involved in the calling of a new minister. He was a <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> member and regular baptism sponsor. 

<p>In 1683, church records said he was living outside the North gate. In <a href="../../census1697.html#071">1697</a>, his household was configured on the Albany census. Two years later he signed an <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6428">oath</a> pledging allegiance to the king of England. City <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6428">assessment</a> rolls placed a modest value on his third ward property.

<p>During the 1680s, he appeared before the Albany court on a number of matters. He was a juror and constable who also leased land at <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canastigione</a> in 1685.


<p>Takel Dirckse Heemstraat was a rank and file resident of Albany who was last heard from in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6428">1720</a> when his name appeared on a list of <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> freeholders. At least one son became an Albany resident.</p>
