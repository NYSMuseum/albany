<strong>William B. Hilton</strong></a> was born in October 1751. He was the son of <a href="bhilton.html">Benjamin</a> and <a href="../p/maprice8458.html">Mary Price</a> Hilton.  He grew up in the small family of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> innkeeper. As a number of "William Hiltons" (including <a href="wmrhilton.html">William R. Hilton</a>, an Albany cartman) were living in the Albany area during the last half of the eighteenth century, this sketch is confined to information specifically referencing "William B. Hilton."

<p>His wife was Margarita <a href="../../res/sp.html">Gl</a>addon. Their daughter was christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany in February 1778.

<p>His name appears to be missing from wartime records.  In his twenties during the American Revolution, we seek information on his wartime activities. His older <a href="bhilton1876.html">brother</a> was a notorious Tory who was forced into exile in Canada. William B., however, appears to have remained in Albany along with his widowed mother.

<p>In March 1779, the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll showed his real and personal <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#48">property</a> and also an additional <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#172">lot</a>. In September he petitioned for and was granted a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA299&lpg=PA299&dq=%22william+b.+hilton%22+albany&source=web&ots=wwgEeSvdhv&sig=6bXUuYBnx1ayouV-Wr7ZeNVARTw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result">one-acre lot</a> also in the first ward. A decade later, his personal property and house were accorded moderate <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wbh">assessments</a>. 
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#wbh">1790</a>, the household of William B. Hilton included three females and three slaves. A few years later, community-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">documents</a> called him a carpenter and also a gentleman.


<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#wh">1800</a>, the census of the first ward included the household of a "William Hilton" (the only WH on the census in that year)  with only an older couple in residence in a location near that of the household of Wiliam B. Hilton described on the census a deacade earlier.

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of William B. Hilton.</p>
