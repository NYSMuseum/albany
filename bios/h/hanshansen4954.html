          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Johannes Hansen</B></A> was born in Albany 
            in 1695 the eldest son of future Mayor <a href="hehansen4939.html">Hendrick</a> 
            and <a href="../vd/dvdam6351.html">Debora Van Dam</a> Hansen. He was 
            known as "Hans Hansen" and was the most prominent of <a href="johansen4955.html">severa</a>l like-named contemporaries.</P>

<p>Following his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> that had moved beyond the Albany stockade, during his twenties Hans spent considerable time in the Indian country and was known as one who traded with the French. 

          <p>At age twenty-eight, he married <a href="../c/sacuyler610.html">Sara Cuyler</a> 
            in 1723. The first of their seven children was born later that year.</p>

<p>Following the death of his father in 1724, Hans became more of an Albany-based merchant and was bolstered by property derived from his father's estate.</p>

<p>To the surprise of many, he was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany in 1731. Although he had served as a constable in 1721, this newly established frontier trader would serve his political apprenticeship later when he was elected second ward alderman first in 1736. His name appeared on a list of second ward freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4954">1742</a>. He was appointed mayor again in 1754, re-appointed, and was in office at the time of his death.</p>
   
<P>Hans Hansen made his <a href="../../wills/willhanshansen.html">will</a> in March 1756 - noting that he was "sound in body." It mentioned his two surviving sons and daughter but made his wife sole heir to his estate.  He died a month later and was buried from the Albany church.</P>
