  <P><b>T</b>he <a href="#sources"><b>Hilton family</b></a> of early Albany traces its roots to the marriage of widower and soldier-turned-innkeeper 
        <a href="wmhilton.html">William Hilton</a> and <a href="../vb/anvberk.html">Anna 
        Van Berkhoven</a> in 1693. Thru the end of the next century, the Hilton 
        family flourished in the city of Albany. Throughout that time, this numerically significant family inhabited the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.</p>

<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#7522">1720</a>, William "the elder's" <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside inn was a pillar of the Anglo-Albanian community.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, five Hilton-named households were listed on the census including the establishment of innkeeper <a href="bhilton.html">Benjamin Hilton</a> and the "<a href="../../census1756.html#177">good house</a>" shared by Jacobus and Richard Hilton.

<p>The Albany Hiltons were found in service and transportation-related activities. They participated in civic activities but were not able to ascend to the rank of <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> - probably not helped by their almost exclusive residence in Albany's most affluent ward where many others stood ahead of them.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, eight Hilton-named households were living in the the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> of the city of Albany. They were the most numerous among the twenty "Hiltons" listed in New York State and also included the household of Albany native but then New Scotland resident <a href="rohilton.html">Robert Hilton</a> - whose growing famiy was enumerated under the census for surrounding <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. 

<p>A decade later, ten Hilton-named households were configured on the first ward city <a href="../../census1800.html">census</a>. Six more Hilton households were listed in Watervliet. The large family of Robert Hilton was enumerated under more recently formed <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA70,M1">1813</a>, eight Hilton addresses remained in the city. In 1816, ten, Hilton-named households (mostly in the first ward) were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.</p>

<p><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously (Helton for example), other (and apparently not closely related) Hilton-named <a href="http://hiltonfamilytree.com/">families</a> established themselves elsewhere in early America.
