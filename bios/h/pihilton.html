<strong>Pieter Hilton</strong></a> was born in February 1739. He was the son of <a href="jahilton7523.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="../m/jumartin7524.html">Judith Martin</a> Hilton. He grew up in the very large <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> family of the second generation of English-speaking Albanians. 

<p>By the late 1760s, he had married his childhood neighbor, the former orphan <a href="../b/jubarret7225.html">Judith Barret</a>. Beginning in late 1768, their children were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. By 1768, he was counted among the membership at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. He also was one of the "Peter Hiltons" who served in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company in 1767 and later in the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">army</a>.

<p>Beyond simple demographics, further articulating his story is complicated by the existence of a number of similarly named Peter Hiltons over the second half of the eighteenth century. This individual sometimes was referred to as "Pieter I." or "Pieter J. Hilton."

<p>However, the general name is referenced in a number of <a href="../../cbr.html">community based resources</a> for the second half of the eighteenth century.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#pih">1788</a>, his (Peter J. Hilton) personal property only was valued on the first ward tax list. In <a href="../../census1790.html#pih">1790</a>, his household was enumerated on the census in Albany's first ward. At that time, his "family" contained eight members. 

<p>Pieter Hilton was still alive in 1818 when he was noted in the probate of the <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> of his wife's brother. He would have been approaching eighty. We seek information on his passing.
