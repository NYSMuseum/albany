<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jane Holland</b></a> was the daughter of frontier officer 
        <a href="hiholland.html">Hitchen Holland</a> and his wife <a href="../c/mgtcollins7678.html">Margaret 
        Collins</a>. She probably was born during the 1730s while her father was 
        on duty at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a> and other places 
        and before Holland <a href="../../im/im1757.html">settled</a> on a farm 
        south of Albany.</p>


<p>She married <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a>-turned-postmaster <a href="../vs/hvschaack.html">Henry Van Schaack</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Church in 1760. Their only child born in 1761 did not survive.</p>

<p>She <a href="../../wills/willhiholland.html">inherited</a> a share of her father's estate. Part of that bequest became their home - a farm located just south of Albany. After a sometimes stormy decade, by 1770s they had removed to Van Schaack's birthplace - the village of Kinderhook.</p>

      <p>Henry Van Schaack was a loyalist. He was forced into exile in New England during 
        the War for Independence. Jane's fate at the time is unknown! <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a></p>

<p>After the war, Van Schaack became a <a href="../vs/hvschaack.html#pittsfield">resident</a> of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. About 1808, he re-established himself in Kinderhook where he and Jane lived out their last days. Jane Holland Van Schaack died in Kinderhook about 1815. Henry Van Schaack died in 1823.</p>
