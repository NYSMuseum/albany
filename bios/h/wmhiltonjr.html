      <P><a href="#sources"><b>William Hilton, Jr.</b></a> was born in May 1708. 
        He was the son of soldier-turned-innkeeper <a href="wmhilton.html">William 
        Hilton</a> and his first wife, <a href="../vb/anvberk.html">Anna Van Berkhoven</a>. 
        His father passed on in 1749 but this adult son was known as "William 
        Jr." for the rest of his life. </p>
      <p>He married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">o</a>ne <a href="../j/mgtjones.html">Margaret 
        Jones</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in October 
        1736. By 1747, five children were baptized there and he sometimes served 
        as a baptism sponsor. In March 1758, another <a href="jawhilton.html">son</a> 
        was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican 
        church. In 1768, the name of William Hilton, Jr. appeared on a list of 
        subscribers at St. Peter's. </p>
      <p> He was a <a href="../../census1756.html#167">carpenter</a> who set up 
        his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He served 
        as constable in 1733; high constable in 1734; and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
        in 1740. He worked for local people and was reimbursed on several occasions 
        by the city government. Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, 
        his name appeared on <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#whjr">lists</a> 
        of qualified freeholders. First ward assessments showed that his holdings 
        were modest.</p>
      <p>After the 1760s, the name of William Hilton, Jr. dropped from Albany 
        rolls.</p>
