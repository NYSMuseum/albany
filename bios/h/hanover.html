<P>The name <a href="#sources"> <strong>Edward Hanover</strong></a> appears on the Albany city assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#edha">1788</a>. At that time, his house and personal property in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> were valued modestly. At this point, that source stands alone following our most recent sweep of our <a href="../../cbr.html">comm</a>unity-based resources. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the Manhattan household of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Edward Hanover was enumerated on the census in the Montgomery Ward." A number of contemporary "Hanovers" were living living in North America. The name appears to be of <a href="../ger.html">Germanic</a> origins and is connected to English nobility. However, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>We may seek to establish a possible connection to <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Flora Hanover, whose household in the second ward was configured on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1800.html#flha">1800</a>.

<p>However, his name has not been encountered in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 

<p>We recognize that presently we have not offered much of value on the life of this one-time Albany resident. Past diminishing returns and following our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based</a> resources, we must move on for now from the life of the one-time Albany resident <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as Edward Hanover. </p>
