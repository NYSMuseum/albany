<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anthony Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born in December 1738. He was the son of <a href="hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/subradt4279.html">Susanna Bradt</a> Hallenbeck. He grew up as a younger son in the very large family of a prominent <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> landholder.

<p>In 1764, Anthony was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> of his father who died two years later. He was among the eight living children who ultimately would share in the substantial estate that encompassed a large part of the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of Albany. 

<p>In 1766 and '67, his first ward house and property was accorded modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>.

<p>In December 1767, he married Albany native <a href="../c/cocooper470.html">Cornelia Cooper</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1788, eleven children had been christened where both parents were members.

<p>In 1773, he sold a lot near the pastures to <a href="../d/jedgarmo809.html">Jellis De Garmo</a>.

<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. Afterwards, he was granted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5247">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>Anthony seems to have raised his family in the landmark <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">Pearl Street</a> house of his father. Assessment rolls for the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5247">remainder</a> of the century <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5247">document</a> his first ward holdings. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the first ward assessment showed two residences under the name of Anthony Hallenbeck.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5247">1790</a>, his household included ten family members. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#5247">later</a>, only two small children were living there with the aging parents.

<p>In 1788 and again in 1791, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">id</a>entified as a fireman in the first ward.

<p>In August <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</A>, he was identified as a freeholder and a shoemaker in the first ward.
 
<p>Anthony Hallenbeck died sometime after 1800. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in January 1809. His widow survived until 1846.</p>
