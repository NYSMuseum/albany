      <P> <a href="#sources"><strong>Dirck Hun</strong></a> was born in December 
        1760. He was the only son in the small family of <a href="wmhun4784.html">William</a> 
        and <a href="../d/sadf4743.html">Sara De Foreest</a> Hun. He grew up in 
        a carpenter's home located on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
        Street</a>. 
      <p>He seems to have been the "Dirck Hunn" who was purchasing supplies from 
        an Albany merchant on behalf of the Assistant Quartermaster in April <a href="../../doc/bus/04081783.html">1783</a>. 
      <p>In December 1782, he married Albany native <a href="../l/anlansing3166.html">Anna 
        Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1793, the marriage had produced seven children - some of whom were christened 
        in Englewood, New Jersey and in Oyster Bay, Long Island. 
      <p>Perhaps he was living in his father's house in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4796">1788</a>. 
        Otherwise, his name is thus-far absent from Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">annals</a>. 
      <p>Dirck Hun died in March 1795. He had lived but thirty-four years. Letters 
        of Administration on his estate were issued in Albany County in February 
        1798.</p>
