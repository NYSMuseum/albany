      <P><a href="#fb">Fam</a>ily-based materials tell us that <a href="#sources">Martin 
        Hebeysen</a> or <a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>ebwiser was born in Germany 
        in March 1738. Thus, his parents were Christian and Eva Christina Steussler 
        "Hebeisin," citizens of the parish of Zeuttlingen. Perhaps he was the 
        "Martin Hebeisen" who was among the passengers on the ship <i>Sally</i> 
        that had sailed from Rotterdam and had taken the <a href="../../nat.html">oath</a> 
        of allegience in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iEAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA493&dq=%22martin+hebeisen%22&lr=#PRA1-PA493,M1">Pennsylvania</a> 
        on October 29, 1770. 
      <p>In America and in his mid-thirties at the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">outbreak</a> 
        of hostilities in 1775, we <a href="../../inprog.html">expect</a> to be 
        able to connect him to wartime activities. 
      <p>After the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8387">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. His 
        inclusion on that list may have meant that he was in Albany during the 
        war years. However, his name has not been found prior to the mid-1780s 
        in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based records</a> thus far encountered. 
      <p><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/marhebsig.jpg" align=right alt="signature of Martin Hebeysen from church records" width=300 height=53 vspace=0 hspace=1>He 
        was married but presently we lack information on his spouse but that he 
        had a childless marriage. From the postwar period on, he was a member, 
        pewholder, and sometime trustee and treasurer (resigned in 1811) of the 
        Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. Church records 
        <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=z8ISAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq">reveal</a> 
        that he joined the church about that time and that he was a blacksmith 
        by "profession" or trade. He was an active churchman for many years and 
        was "strenuously opposed" to the abandonment of the German language in 
        services - after which he stopped attending church. 
      <p>Beginning in December 1786, his account was paid from <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> 
        funds. In 1801, he paid seven dollars for a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#grocer">grocer's</a> 
        license. He does not seem to have held any civic positions. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8387">1788</a>, his house and 
        lot were included on the Albany assessment roll in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. His real property was valued as neglible and his personal holdings 
        at somewhat more. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8387">1790</a>, the 
        first ward census showed that his household included two men and a woman. 
        A decade later, the <a href="../../census1800.html#8387">census</a> showed 
        only the older couple and a slave in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> 
        household. 
      <p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA69,M1">1813</a>, 
        the first city directory identified him as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#grocer">grocer</a> 
        living at 67 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a> - a 
        few buildings east of <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl</a> 
        Street . He was a fixture at that address in directories at least until 
        1822. 
      <p>According to his tombstone, "Martin Hebeysen, a native of Zuettlingen 
        in Germany," died June 19, 1827 at age eighty-eight years, seven months, 
        and eight days. He was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Dutch 
        church <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=%22martin+hebeysen%22+albany&source=web&ots=SoevXJrhCi&sig=dO5deQud78xyfGPZu2HF50J80To#PPA154,M1">plot</a> 
        of the Albany cemetery. At that time, he still was living at 67 Hudson. 
        His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate 
        in August. The "widow of Martin Hebeysen" (still unmaned) was listed in 
        the directory in 1830. The couple left no direct heirs.</p>
