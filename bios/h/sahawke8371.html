      <P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously (perhaps "Hauck"), 
        <a href="#sources"><strong>Sarah Hawke</strong></a> probably was born 
        within a few years of 1740. Perhaps she was the sister of Albany contemporary 
        <a href="chhawk.html">Christopher Hawk</a>. However, we seek defining 
        information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path 
        to Albany. 
      <p>In July 1761, she married <a href="../r/coruby1056.html">Conrad Ruby</a> 
        at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. The 
        marriage produced several children. Although she witnessed a number of 
        baptisms in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>, like 
        her husband, she was a member of the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran 
        church</a>. 
      <p>These Rubys made their home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a> near the northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">border</a> 
        of the city of Albany. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">Assessment 
        rolls</a> noted their real and personal property on Pearl on several occasions. 
        In 1802, the "widow of Ruby" was identified as the property owner. 
      <p>Following a marriage of almost forty years, Conrad Ruby died about 1800. 
        In that year, Sarah was <a href="../../census1800.html#8371">named</a> 
        as head of their <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household 
        that included one boy, two girls, and two women. Ten years later, those 
        occupants were joined on the census by seven <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free 
        people of color</a>. Perhaps she was running a rooming house. In 1814, 
        the city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">Directory</a> identified her 
        home at 24 <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick</a> Street. 
      <p>Sarah Hawke Ruby died sometime after 1814. In 1815, two Ruby-named households 
        (probably her adult sons) were listed in the directory in the vicinity 
        of Sarah's home. In 1820, the Albany Directory identified the home of 
        "Christy Ruby" (probably her son <a href="../r/chruby.html">Christopher</a>) 
        at 24 Van Schaick.</p>
