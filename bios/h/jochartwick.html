<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John C. Hartwick</strong></a> (often John Christopher Hartwick <a href="../../res/sp.html">and</a> sometimes Hartwig) was an evangelical <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> minister in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> during the second half of the eighteenth century. Although <a href="../../na/na.html">mostly not</a> an actual city <a href="../../criteria.html">resident</a>, his activities impacted the lives of a substantial number of early Albany people. This sketch focuses on his Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a> and leaves his larger life to his more and less comprehensive <a href="#sources">bio</a>graphers.

<p>Hartwick was born in Germany during the first half of 1714. According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional resources, he is said to have been well educated at the University of Halle and to have been an advocate of Lutheran Pietism. The course of his ministry in Europe following ordination is unclear.

<p>Hartwick would have been in his thirties when he was called to North America in 1746 to serve as a missionary to the <a href="../ger.html">German</a> settlers in the area around Rhinebeck. However, his moralistic bent, rigidity, and eccentricity led to his removal from his <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ny4/djw/GermantownLutheranHistory.html">first calling</a> and would be render him an itinerant preacher without sustained employment and dependent on charity for most of his life.
 
<p>Beginning in 1754, he led an <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pCQ2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA280&lpg=PA280&dq=%22john+christr.+hartwick%22&source=bl&ots=I7VlMtHoxh&sig=-xAHcJRwQv1tvOO_MBxUuJn1in4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BIHXVM36GuOxsATft4HYDw&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20christr.%20hartwick%22&f=false">initiative</a> that in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pCQ2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA302&lpg=PA=302&dq=%22john+christr.+hartwick%22&source=bl&ots=I7VlMtHoxh&sig=-xAHcJRwQv1tvOO_MBxUuJn1in4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BIHXVM36GuOxsATft4HYDw&ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20christr.%20hartwick%22&f=false">1761</a> left him and ten partners with  more than <a href="../../res/realestate.html">21,000 acres</a> south of the Mohawk and west of the Susquehanna in the area that became Cooperstown. On that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartwick,_New_York">land</a>, he envisioned a pietistic <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=JKVci-hFzAEC&pg=PA175&lpg=PA175&dq=%22john+christopher+hartwick%22+new+york&source=bl&ots=6m9tMDKKYJ&sig=OyULwgldSy37tMO0oOJ41vs8STw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dxBbVYvsJbPIsASusoGQDA&ved=0CFgQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20christopher%20hartwick%22%20new%20york&f=false">utopian community</a> he planned to call "<a href="http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/Quaderno/Quaderno5/Q5.C7.Taylor.pdf">New Jerusalem</a>."

<p>This difficult eccentric was reputedly "repulsed" by women and probably never married. 

      <p>In November 1771, he successfully <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA232&lpg=PA232&dq=%22hartwick%22&source=bl&ots=wxhEbWubgv&sig=V7qpq05Rgxc_B9TD3xs58igXxUs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dFkEUJy2MuS46gGkwqHwBg#v=onepage&q=%22hartwick%22&f=false">petitioned</a> 
        the city Council for a room in the <a href="../../loc/hospital.html">hospital</a> 
        "till next spring" <a href="../../res/ts.html">pres</a>umably for use 
        in holding revival meetings. In March 1772, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany 
        Gazette</i></a> advertised that "During Lent, [Hartwick] will give weekly 
        Lectures on Our Savior's Passion to be held in Room (No. 9) of he Hospital. 
        The first is to be on Sunday, the 15th inst. at 5 o'clock in the evening. 
        N.B. The lecture will be delivered in the English language." 
      <p>At this point, we recognize that we have only an incomplete record of John C. Hartwick's life. For example, we have not been able to account for his time during the era of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a> as he thus far has escaped notice in the extant records of wartime <a href="../../coc.html">governments.</a> Perhaps, he was among those taking refuge on Livingston Manor. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#joha">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. Living in that house at what probably was a more rural part of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> (and probably south of Albany) were two unspecified females. During that time, he also boarded at the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA669&lpg=PA669&dq=%22was+the+residence+of+John+Andrews%22&source=bl&ots=m2cWXBcMoW&sig=7pX_sssyCBBGvz-hagVTyfnm2JE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=B-pZVaj0I8HLsAST54GwCw&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22was%20the%20residence%20of%20John%20Andrews%22&f=false">Pearl Street</a> home of merchant <a href="../a/joandrews7139.html">John Andrews</a> and at <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DKXyRolJr68C&pg=PA19&lpg=PA18&ots=A8COPZlJZk&focus=viewport&dq=%22john+andrews%22#v=onepage&q=john%20andrews&f=false">other places</a> as he soon wore out his welcome in each locale. Even through his late seventies (and possibly beyond), Hartwick appears to have been constantly on the move and does not seem to lived a "settled life." 

<p>Stricken while enroute from New York to Albany, John C. Hartwick died "unexpectedly" at the Livingston family seat at Clermont in July 1796. Lieutenant Governor <a href="../vr/jevr5085.html">Jeremiah Van Rensselaer</a> was among those named executors of his estate. Following his death, there was some <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_opPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=%22van+rensselaer%22+hartwick&source=bl&ots=D4mUfH6p7D&sig=h82xiS3HKbxgTNSdrMQ8gCpBFRI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ukfXVPadFtSHsQTp2IKYCA&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22van%20rensselaer%22%20hartwick&f=false">lobbying</a> to use the estate resources intended to establish a Lutheran seminary to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_opPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=%22hartwick&source=bl&ots=D4mUfH6p7D&sig=h82xiS3HKbxgTNSdrMQ8gCpBFRI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ukfXVPadFtSHsQTp2IKYCA&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%20hartwick&f=false">locate it in Albany</a>. Instead, however, that initiative succeeded as Hartwick Seminary and today as Hartwick College in Oneonta, Otsego County. 

      <p>The image shown here has been adapted from a tablet sunk into the floor of 
        the Lutheran Ebenezer church in Albany (today First Lutheran Church) - 
        where his remains were recommitted in February 1798. Hartwick had been 
        receiving services at First Lutheran and was a member there for a number 
        of years. 
      <p>His will passed (detailing specific estate instructions) probate in Albany County in August 1799.</p>
