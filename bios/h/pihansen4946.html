<strong>Pieter Hansen</strong></a> was born in October 1737. He was the son of Albany leader <a href="hanshansen4954.html">Hans Hansen</a> and his wife, <a href="../c/sacuyler610.html">Sara Cuyler</a> Hansen. He grew up in the second ward home of a prominent merchant. His father died in 1756 and he continued to <a href="../../census1756.html#140">live</a> with his mother until her passing a decade or more later. With her death, Pieter took title to their home by the terms of his father's <a href="../../wills/willhanshansen.html">will</a>.

<p>He was in his mid-forties when he married young <a href="../f/rafonda3857.html">Rachel Fonda</a> in 1781. Their only child was born the following year. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.


<p>Pieter Hansen was a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4946">merchant</a> and started out in service positions in the Albany government. He served as constable and firemaster in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>Although he owned <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> in Albany and beyond, he was rarely mentioned as the head of an Albany household. 

<p>In 1766, he was among the men who signed a <a href="../../solconst.html#4946">constitution</a> for the Albany Sons of Liberty. Although in his prime during the war years, his absence from Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">records</a> is striking.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4946">1788</a>, he was identified as a boarder in a second ward home. His name did not appear on the Albany <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> in 1790. But in 1794-96, he was named superintendant and city watchman.

<p>Perhaps he was the Peter Hansen mentioned in the Dutch church burial records in September 1801.

The life of Pieter <a href="hansen.html">Hansen</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 4946. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We seek more information on his marriage and passing. Could he have been the same Pieter Hansen of Tribe's Hill who lived in the Mohawk Valley at that time?
