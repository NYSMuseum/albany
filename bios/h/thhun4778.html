<P>According to family-based <a href="../../res/ts.html">res</a>ources, <a href="#sources"><b>Thomas Harmanse</b></a> was born in 1668. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="hthun4772.html">Harmen Thomase</a> and the widow <a href="../b/cabercx7334.html">Catharina Bercx Bensing</a> Hun. He was raised in the large combined family of early Albany mainliners. Skipper <a href="../b/dibensing7320.html">Dirck Bensing</a> was his older step brother.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=%22hun+(van+hun)%22&source=bl&ots=I6vt8SH9JA&sig=KxixeXvISAlKWi_sB99_gzz330I&hl=en&ei=fO01TebyCML-8AacsZiICQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22hun%20(van%20hun)%22&f=false">1681</a>, his father is said to have conveyed 20 morgans of land on the "Murderers Creek" (east bank) to his children Thomas and Wyntie.

<p>In November 1692, Thomas married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> native <a href="../o/mayoo686.html">Mayke Jans Oothout</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1709, nine of their children were baptized in the church where he was a member and frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>These Huns raised their family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Thomas Harmanse served as firemaster, assessor, surveyor, juror, and was elected assistant alderman in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1709">1709</a>.
 
He was a <a href="../../census1697.html#085">prominent</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4778">successful</a> Albany <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who also owned <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> beyond the city. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4778">1699</a>, he joined with his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. In 1715, he was listed on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas Harmanse Hun died in November 1716 at the age of forty-eight. His widow survived for many years after!</p>
