<strong>Nicholas Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born in December 1747. He was the son of <a href="ishallenbeck5282.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../vw/gervwoert2516.html">Gerritje Van Woert</a> Hallenbeck. In 1764, he was scheduled to receive a conditional bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> of his grandfather. Apparently, his father had left Albany by that time and did not return.

<p>In 1771, he married Jane Willis at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. At that time, he was identified as a carpenter. By 1775, the marriage had produced two children. In June 1787, he married Maria Shutt at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1772">1772</a>, he was chosen constable for the second ward. In October 1773, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">examined</a> regarding a disputed election for city alderman. He stated that he was born in Albany and had lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> for approximately eleven months.

<p>Not thirty at the start of the <a href="../../or/or-be.html">war</a>, we seek information on his wartime activities. In June 1780, he was <a href="../../cddc.html">identified</a> as a carpenter and a bailsman for John Blackley. A month late, he was discharged (released) from that duty. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, his real property holdings were valued on city assessment rolls. On both surveys, returns showed two pieces of property - one as part of the larger Hallenbeck holdings on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. The other lot may have been in the third ward. A decade later, his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">holdings</a> no longer appeared on Albany rolls. 

<p>We seek information on his later life and passing.</p>
