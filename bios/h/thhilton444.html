<strong>Thomas Hilton</strong></a> was born in May 1742. He was the son of <a href="wmhiltonjr.html">William Hilton, Jr.</a> and his wife Margarita or Maria Jones. He grew up as a middle child in the smallish family in the home of a <a href="../../census1756.html#167">car</a>penter who lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In 1767, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In 1768, he was identified as a single subscriber and in <a href="../../coerec1771.html#444">1771</a> as a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. In January 1770, he was made a member of the Albany night watch. 

<p>His wife was <a href="../c/nacadogen.html">Nancy (Ann) Cadogen</a>. A daughter was christened in September 1779 and a son in <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/aluth001.htm">1784</a> - in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch</a> and <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> churches.

<p>Like his father, Thomas Hilton was a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a>. On a number of occasions over several decades, he was paid from the city treasury for work done.

<p>From the mid-1760s on, his first ward property was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">ass</a>essment <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#444">rolls</a>.  In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#444">1788</a>, the real and personal property of "Thomas W. Hilton" were accorded the most modest of assessments. In <a href="../../census1790.html#444">1790</a>, his household included six members. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#444">later</a>,  only the parents and two small children remained in the home.

<p>His house was located above <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a> and may have fronted on <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">H</a>udson. During the 1760s, he acquired additional acreage in that area but could not maintain payments on it and his property agreement with the city was cancelled.

<p>Thomas Hilton died in September 1802 and was buried from the Dutch church. His widow survived at least until 1821 in her home on the corner of Union and Division Streets.</p>
