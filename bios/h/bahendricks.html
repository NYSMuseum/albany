<P>The one-time Albany resident known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously as Widow <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barentie Hendricks</strong></a> was the second wife of Domine <a href="../s/gidschaets.html">Gideon Schaets</a>. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that she was 
born in Europe during the early 1600s.. We seek documentation regarding her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>, first marriage, and path to Albany.

      <p>Her first husband is said to have been Manhattan tavernkeeper <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/1999-06/0929118900">Ge</a>rrit 
        <a href="../../res/sp.html">W</a>ollewever. In any event, Barentje was a widow when she <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/nn/church/rdcmarr1683.shtml">married</a> 
        the aged Gideon Schaets in New York in August 1683. As the groom then 
        was in his seventies, that union probably would not have produced children. We have not encountered children from a first marriage. 
		
<p>She appears to have lived with Schaets in Albany. Her name was included on the original list of members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> dating from 1683. At that time she was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u_5SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=Barentje+Wollewever,+alias+Schaats&source=bl&ots=xpw7SUFc5W&sig=uNo8E2MddnozIJipKj9WPkgclcI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=FuY_VPD3K478sASQroGwDw&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Barentje%20Wollewever%2C%20alias%20Schaats&f=false">referred to</a> as "Barentje Wollewever, alias Schaats." Subsequently, she served as a baptism sponsor in Albany.

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources have <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2005-01/1105730314">noted</a> her will dated October 27, 1688 which purported to have left her house to Gideon Schaets.  On December 11, 1688 the minutes of the Albany Mayor's court <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7#v=snippet&q=barentie&f=false">noted</a> that <blockquote>"Dom Gideon Schaets doth by Bennony Van Corlaer produce into court ye last will and testament of his decased wife, Barentie Hendricks, dated ye 26th Oct. 1688, whereunto were wittnesses Paulus Martense and John Harris, who being called, declared upon oath that they see ye" said Barentie Hendrickse in good and perfect memory and in sound understanding when she signd and sealed sd will. Ordered that ye sd will be translated and recorded accordingly."</blockquote> However, we have not yet located that document.

<p>Thus, we can surmise that Barentie Hendricks Schaets died between October and December 1688 - ending her five-year second marriage. Schaets lived until 1694.</p>
