<strong>Petrus Hilton</strong></a> was born in November 1728. He was the son of <a href="rihilton7618.html">Ryckert</a> and <a href="../b/maben7316.html">Maria Bennewe</a> Hilton. He was the eldest son in the large family of a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> carpenter who lived for almost the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycoloni/burnewsp.html">entire</a> eighteenth century. Presently, we have confined this exposition to information on "Petrus" to prevent confusion with at least two additional "Pieter Hiltons" living in the Albany area at that time.

<p>He first married <a href="../w/macwyn6227.html">Machtelt Wyngaert</a>. After her death in September 1754, Petrus married the slightly older Albany native <a href="../b/anbrooks340.html">Anna Brooks</a>.  By 1771, as many as nine children had been christened in Albany churches from the two marriages. From 1754 thru 1770, Petrus Hilton was a regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In 1766 and '67, Petrus Hilton's first ward property was valued modestly on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#ph">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.


<p>After 1770, the name of Petrus Hilton has not been found on Albany rolls. However, the <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#ph">estate inventory</a> following the death of Dr. <a href="../vd/hvdyck832.html">Henry Van Dyck</a> in 1786 showed that Petrus Hilton had owed five pounds and nine shillings. As stated above, his father lived until 1795.</p>
