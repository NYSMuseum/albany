      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dirck Hansen</strong></a> was born in April 
        1743. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="ryhansen4960.html">Ryckert</a> 
        (Dirck) Hansen and his second wife <a href="../t/catbroeck14.html">Catharina 
        Ten Broeck</a> Hansen. 
      <p>His father was dead by the late 1760s. In his early twenties, Dirck stepped 
        in to hold the cross-river <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> on 
        his mother's behalf beginning in 1767. During this time, he lived with 
        his mother in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
      <p>This Dirck Hansen served in an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html">company</a> 
        of the provincial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. At the 
        outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> in 1775, he <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">came 
        forward</a> to accept lieutenant's commissions in the Revolutionary militia 
        and in the Continental line as well. In December 1776, he was commissioned 
        a captain in Colonel <a href="../l/jalivingston8605.html">James Livingston</a>'s 
        Canadian refugee regiment. He served in the Continental army until January 
        1781 when he retired and returned home. 
      <p>In July 1781, he would have been thirty-eight when he married Manhattan 
        refugee <a href="../l/helow8449.html">Helena Low</a> at the Albany Dutch 
        church. His wife's mother was a member of the Albany <a href="../c/cuyler.html">Cuyler</a> 
        family. By 1796, the marriage had produced at least five children. 
      <p>These Hansens lived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Greenbush</a> 
        and continued to operate the ferry in partnership with <a href="../l/thlottridge414.html">Thomas 
        Lottridge</a> well into the 1780s. Their home probably was near the east 
        bank ferry landing. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, "Derrick 
        Hansen's" Rensselaerswyck home included six females and was served by 
        eight slaves. 
      <p>Dirck Hansen filed a <a href="../../sources.html#cw">will</a> in June 
        1799. It named his wife and children to inherit his real and personal 
        property. He died a few months later. His widow remarried and lived at 
        least until 1837 when she was able to apply for his Revolutionary War 
        pension.</p>
