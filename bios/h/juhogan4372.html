      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Jurrian Hogan</b></a> was born in 1693. He was 
        the first child of soldier-turned-innkeeper <a href="wmhogan4396.html">William 
        Hogan</a> and his wife, Albany native <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">Martina 
        Becker</a> Hogan. He grew up on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> 
        surrounded by the Albany families of a number of former <a href="../../garrison.html">garr</a>ison 
        soldiers.</p>
      <p>He married <a href="../b/mabeekman3874.html">Maria Beekman</a> in 1714. 
        Between 1718 and 1740, nine of their children were baptized in the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1732, six of those children 
        were identified in the <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">will</a> 
        of his parents. Later, Jurrian was identified as a communicant at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Anglican church.</p>
      <p>Following his marriage, Jurrian, or John as he sometimes was called, 
        set up a home on Pearl Street in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>. He also held land along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes 
        Creek</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#4372">1715</a>, he 
        was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. In 1718, he served for a year as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. 
        His name also appeared on Albany voter lists in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4372">1720</a> 
        and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4372">1742</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#96">1756</a>, 
        he was listed on the city census as Mr. Hogan and identified as a merchant. 
      <p>In 1737, he was among those who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoroseboom1671.html">will</a> 
        of a neighbor. 
      <p>An Albany mainstay for more than fifty years, Jurrian and Maria Hogan 
        filed a <a href="../../wills/willjuhogan.html">joint will</a> in May 1764. 
        It named their seven children - six of whom were then living. The will 
        passed probate two years later.</p>
