<P>Based on family <a href="">res</a>ources, future Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ephraim Hunt</strong></a> was born in November 1758. He was the last child born into the very large family of John Hunt <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~huntpage/enoch0001.htm#i442">and</a> Ruth <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/f/e/s/James-Richard-Fessenden/GENE1-0009.html">Fess</a>enden of Watertown, Massachusetts. He may have been the brother of future Albany neighbor <a href="wmhunt8601.html">William Hunt</a>. His father appears to have been a graduate of Harvard and to have died in 1777. We seek further documentation on Ephraim's <a href="../../res/origins.html">formative years</a> and path to post-war Albany.

<p>With several same-named contemporaries at-risk, we expect to find <a href="http://wardepartmentpapers.org/searchresults.php?searchClass=fulltextSearch&fulltextQuery=Ephraim+Hunt">information</a> relating to his Revolutionary War <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a> military and other activities. However, this individual <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=hunt+ephraim&printsec=frontcover&source#v=onepage&q=hunt&f=false">may have been</a> an officer in a Massachusetts regiment.

<p>He seems to be the Ephraim Hunt who was married to one Catherine Bush <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~schwachahistory/hunt/generation5.html">and/or</a> Eliza Palmer. Perhaps their children were christened prior to his arrival in Albany.

<p>In 1794, one Ephraim Hunt was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=L0XxrMd4nEsC&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=%22ephraim+hunt%22+albany&source=bl&ots=cNlnd8_L_e&sig=ik_QqoAObXgvYVRIUDH5Vu2mfnA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ZF0-Vc-3KoqeyASfuYDgAQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22ephraim%20hunt%22%20albany&f=false">named</a> postmaster at New Lebanon. In <a href="http://www.omdhs.syracusemasons.com/sites/default/files/history/Craft%20Masonry%20in%20Columbia%20County.pdf">1795</a>, one Ephraim Hunt signed in at a <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic Lodge</a> in Stephentown, New York. Probably afterwards, his name was included on the roster of an <a href="../../org/masonic.html#8598">Albany Lodge</a>.

<p>In 1798, at least three Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">jury lists</a> identified him as a <a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">yeo</a>man and as a "gentleman."

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll under the house of either <a href="../w/phwag.html">Philip Wagonner</a> or <a href="../r/coryckman.html">Widow Price</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#8598">1800</a>, his household was configured on the census for the first ward. However, by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, his house, lot, and personal property on Columbia Street were valued on the assessment roll for the second ward.

<p>From 1800 thru 1803, he was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=zXZIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA426&lpg=PA426&dq=%22ephraim+hunt%22+albany&source=bl&ots=S39NT2ZKZw&sig=lpC81o95Qn9oub3ixROwAhvj-50&hl=en&sa=X&ei=WeBEVY6mILb7sASm-4HQCQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22ephraim%20hunt%22%20albany&f=false">identified</a> as the sergeant-at-arms of the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html#nys">Assembly</a>.

<p>On October 22, 1805, the <i>Albany Centeniel</i> noted the passing of Ephraim Hunt at age 47. In February 1806, letters of administration were issued on his estate in Albany County.</p>
