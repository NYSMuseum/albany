<P>Often referred to as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abel D. Hawkins</strong></a>, this individual settled in Albany as a young adult. He appears to have been born during the 1770s. A number of same-named contemporaries (including three on the census in Connecticut in 1790) are at-risk in the <a href="../../yankinv.html">region</a>. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#8374">1800</a>, his household consisting only of a young couple was configured in the second ward. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, the maturing couple was joined by three children but also four additional men of Abel's general age. Assessment rolls for the early <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1800s</a> valued his second ward real and personal property modestly. However, his name does not seem to appear on the citywide assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>.

<p>His wife was <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Hannah Drew who joined the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church in 1804. Three children were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WpxrPm-x_iAC&pg=RA1-PA181&lpg=RA1-PA181&dq=%22hawkins%22+abel+albany&source=bl&ots=bXLhEPLM2D&sig=BoxjLlsHaKMPerbj5RexyMDqLZk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi94IWjzLjUAhUGeT4KHZjoBZY4ChDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&q=%22hawkins%22%20abel%20albany&f=false">christened</a> to them during the early 1800s.
 
<p>From the first edition in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22holkins%22&source=bl&ots=2hLxOZXx9A&sig=1u1u_V4JYutjq_trCGqkeuehJ04&hl=en&ei=JzFfSpOOH46itgfMkZzgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4#v=onepage&q=holkins&f=false">1813</a> on, he (<a href="../../res/sp.html">sometimes</a> Holkins) was listed as a builder at several addresses on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. In 1820, the Albany directory listed "Abel D. Holkins" as a carpenter at 32 Hudson Street.

<p>In <a href="https://archive.org/details/listoflandstobes00newy_0">1826</a>, two parcels on the east side of Liberty Street (p.4) under the name of "<a href="https://archive.org/stream/listoflandstobes00newy_0/listoflandstobes00newy_0_djvu.txt">Abel D. Holkins</a>" were to be sold for delinquent taxes.

<p>After that, none of the more common <a href="../../res/sp.html">variants</a> of the name of Abel D. Hawkins, have been encountered in our latest sweeps of community and <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a> based records. With unresolved basic <a href="../../res/bios.html">elements</a> of his life, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
