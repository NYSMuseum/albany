<strong>Jacob W. Hilton</strong></a> was born in 1758 and christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church on March 10. He was the son of <a href="wmhiltonjr.html">William</a> and Margaret Jones Hilton. He was known as "Jacob W. Hilton" to distinguish him from other, same-named contemporaries.

<p>In 1779, "Jacob Hilton" was <a href="../../sources.html#cp">id</a>entified as a rank-and-file member of Capt. <a href="../p/joprice6447.html">John Price</a>'s militia company. In 1781, he summoned and apprehended witnesses and suspects on behalf of the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>. Afterwards, Jacob W. was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#jwh">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1780">1780</a> and 1781, he was appointed and served as a constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 

<p>In August 1781, he is <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=rbond007&id=I10460&ti=5538">said</a> to have married Albany resident Mary <a href="#daughter">Pemberton</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their son was christened at St. Peter's in March 1788. Before and afterwards, a number of children were <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=rbond007&id=I10460&ti=5538">ch</a>ristened to those parents in Schoharie.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jwh">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>This individual was <a href="http://awt.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=rbond007&id=I10460&ti=5538">said</a> to have lived in southern Albany County in New Baltimore, Beaver ___, and then Coxsackie.

<p>Perhaps this Jacob W. Hilton was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/census_1810_coxsackie.htm">identified</a> as the head of a Coxsackie household on the census in 1810.

<p>In January 1833, Jacob W. Hilton was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/pensioners_1835.htm">granted</a> an annual  pension of $59.74 as a militia private retroactive to March 1831. He was identified as then 75 years old. 

<p>Jacob W. Hilton died in Coxsackie in March 1839. His widow survived into the 1840s.</p>
