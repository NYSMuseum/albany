<strong>Robert Hewson</strong></a> was born in January 1764. He was the son of <a href="dahewson8623.html">Daniel</a> and <a href="../b/mabarret7230.html">Mary Barret</a> Hewson. He grew up in a modest <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home surrounded by members of both the Hewson and Barret families.

<p>In June 1789, he married his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> neighbor <a href="../g/elgeyer8615.html">Elizabeth Geyer</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. Their daughter was christened at St. Peter's on January 1, 1790. Hopefully coincidentally, "another" Elizabeth Geyer married <a href="dahewson8624.html">Daniel J. Hewson</a> about that time.

<p>Their budding first ward household was configured on the city census in <a href="../../census1790.html#8349">1790</a>. Two years earlier, his personal possessions were <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8349">valued</a> on the assessment roll under the house of his father.

<p>In August 1795, the burial of "Robert Hewson and Wife" was charged from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In January 1795, letters of administration had been issued on his estate. He had lived less than thirty-five years.

<p>Diplomat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_H._Pruyn">Robert Hewson Pruyn</a> was his grandson.</p>
