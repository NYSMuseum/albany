<strong>Johannes Hansen</strong></a> was born in September 1743. He was the eldest son of <a href="ishansen4952.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../b/mabradt4266.html">Maria Bradt</a> Hansen. He grew up a member of the large family of a third ward shoemaker <a href="../../census1756.html#37">surrounded</a> by a larger extended family.

<p>His father died in 1758 leaving widow Maria to hold the family home until her two sons came of age during the 1760s and 70s.
  
<p>In October 1764, Johannes married <a href="../s/geersling5421.html">Geertruy Slingerland</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1784, six children had been christened at the Albany church. Some of those births and other family information was recorded in a Hansen <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">family bible</a> kept by Johannes and others before and afterwards.

<p>Like his father and <a href="behansen4963.html">brother</a>, this John Hansen was a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> and an Albany resident. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4980">1790</a>, his second ward household also included his bachelor brother and possibly his mother. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#4980">later</a>, his mother had passed on and Benjamin Hansen had established his own household nearby.

<p>At this point, we are <a href="../../inprog.html">less certain</a> about the body other <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">survey references</a> we have assembled for John or Johannes Hansen.  
<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22hansen&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hansen&f=false">1813</a>, his lower Steuben Street residence was listed on the third ward census.</p>
