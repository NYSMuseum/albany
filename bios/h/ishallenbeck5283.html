<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born in December 1770. He was the son of <a href="behallenbeck5249.html">Bernardus</a> and <a href="../c/coclark.html">Neeltie Clark</a> Hallenbeck. He grew up in a large family in a <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">Washington Street</a> home that was in the center of a large <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">family plot</a> on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside of Albany. His father passed on in 1792 but his mother remained in the family home for at least another decade. We tread lightly here due to the possible survival of more than one older, same-named <a href="ishallenbeck5282.html">individual</a>s.

<p>In May 1794, Isaac is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=W4o-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1341&lpg=PA1341&dq=%22isaac+hallenbeck%22+bethlehem&source=bl&ots=hLPQO7Xl06&sig=0u_ewdjrPax5LxsEhdQsOkzynAY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=GfsjUeWCMqKW0QGosoCwBg&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20hallenbeck%22%20bethlehem&f=false">said</a> to have married Catharina La Rue of New York City. In March 1807, he is said to have married Cornelia Vanderpoel (Provost?). The two marriages produced a number of children - those born before 1800 were christened in New York.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#5283">1800</a>, his household (counting a man in his age bracket and perhaps next to that of his widowed mother) was configured on the census for Albany's first ward. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">Ass</a>essment rolls valued his Albany holdings moderately.

<p>After <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, he seems to have relocated to <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> where his household was configured on the census in 1820.

<p>Isaac Hallenbeck is said to have died in 1844.

<p>With outstanding questions and concerns regarding the context of his later life, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
