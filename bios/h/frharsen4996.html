<strong>Frans Harsen</strong></a> (Francis Harsin) was born in February 1754. He was the son of frontier trader/smith <a href="beharsen8347.html">Bernardus</a> and <a href="../p/capruyn.html">Catharina Pruyn</a> Harsen. By the 1750s, these Harsens had settled permanently in Albany where they raised a large family.

<p>In July 1779, he married Rebecca Spoor. By 1795, six children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Beginning in that year, his name appeared on Albany survey <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">documents</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4996">1788</a>, his third ward personal property was evaluated on the citywide tax list. It appears that he was living in a house headed by a member of the Spoor family. His name is absent from the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> of heads of households taken two years later. Perhaps his family were boarders.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, he served in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> but was exempted from service because he was employed as a carpenter.
<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1778">1778</a>, he was appointed constable in the city. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1780">1780</a>, he was named firemaster in the third ward. During the mid-1790s, he served as the city watchman. During the 1780s, he was paid by the Albany government. 


<p>Frans Harsen was last heard from during the mid-1790s.</p>
