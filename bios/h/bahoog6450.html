<P><a href="#sources"><b>Bartholomeus Pieterse Hoogeboom</b></a> (Mees Pieterse) was born during the first half of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>In 1657, he appeared before the Court in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> to answer an assault charge. During the 1670s, he was known as the skipper and owner of a vessel that carried cargoes between Albany and New York. He was known in several ports along the Hudson River. Over several decades and on a range of matters, he was a litigant and witness at the Albany <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">court house</a>.

<p>By the 1680s, he had settled in Albany and owned a lot outside of the north gate. A decade later, his household was enumerated on the city <a href="../../census1697.html#172">census</a>.  


<p>His wife was named Catryn. The marriage produced several children. Perhaps his last son was baptized in December 1699 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Mees Hoogenboom was a member.</p>

<p>Bartholomeus Pieterse Hoogeboom died in February 1703. His Albany property remained on the assessment roll as late as <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">1709</a>.</p>
