<strong>Abraham Hooghkerk</strong></a> was born in October 1744. He was a younger son of <a href="luhoog3604.html">Lucas</a> and <a href="../f/refonda3840.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Hooghkerk. He grew up on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany below the family <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">brickyard</a>. 

<p>In October 1767, he married <a href="anhilton2925.html">Anna (Nancy) Hilton</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1786, seven children had been christened in the church where he was a member, pewholder, and occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>Like his father and <a href="luhooghkerk3603.html">grandfather</a>, Abraham Hooghkerk was a brickmaker who operated the family brickworks in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>.  He was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">known</a> as a brickmaker through the end of the century. Abraham and Nancy made their <a href="../../census1790.html#3583">home</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver</a> Street near those of <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3538">both</a> of their families. 

<p>Although his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company in 1767, unlike his <a href="johooghkerk3600.html">younger brother</a>, he does not appear to have served as a soldier during the War for Independence. However, during the early 1770s, his account was paid from the city treasury.

<p>In 1787, the city records noted that he still occupied and "uses the land as a brickyard." In <a href="../../census1800.html#3583">1800</a>, his first ward home included two young men, a young woman, and Abraham and his wife. 

<p>In March 1804, he was among those who sold a lot of land on <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>.

<p>Abraham Hooghkerk died in May 1807 at the age of sixty-three. He was buried in his church cemetery plot. His will passed probate in January 1814. His widow lived on in their home at 38 Beaver Street until sometime after 1822. </p>
