<P><a href="../../res/guess.html">Per</a>haps, this <a href="#sources"><b>Martina Hogan</b></a> was born in July 1740. Thus, she would have been the first daughter of <a href="wmhogan4398.html">William</a> and <a href="../l/sulansing3682.html">Susanna Lansing</a> Hogan. However, she does not appear to have been named in the <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan4398.html">will</a> filed by William Hogan in 1787. The name Martina honored the Hogan family <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">matriarch</a> who died in 1736.

<p>In August 1761, a British army chaplain married her and <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Rector <a href="../b/thbrown7460.html">Rev. Thomas Brown</a> at the Albany Anglican church. At that time, she was referred to as "Mertcha."  At least two of her children were baptized there during the decade that followed.</p>

<p>While at St. Peter's, Brown's family lived in both the old and new minister's houses. In 1768, the Browns left Albany. In 1772, he was appointed rector in Dorchester, Maryland. After Brown's death in 1784, Martina and the children returned home to Albany.

<p>Perhaps her first ward holdings listed under "Widow Brown & Son & House" were valued on the assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4379">1788</a>. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">later</a>. personal property in the second ward was valued modestly.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#4379">1790</a>, she was identified as the head of an Albany household in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> that included several children. A decade later the first ward <a href="../../census1800.html#4379">census</a> configured the household of "Matilda Brown" with two men, three adult women, and two girls.


<p>The widow Martina Hogan Brown died about 1807. Her <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in March.</p>
