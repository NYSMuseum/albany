<strong>Jacobus Hilton</strong></a> was born in August 1705. He was the son of <a href="wmhilton.html">William Hilton</a> and his second wife <a href="../vb/anvberk.html">Anna Van Berkhoven</a> Hilton. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">Southside</a> home of a former soldier and marginal trader.</P>

<p>In 1733, he married <a href="../m/jumartin7524.html">Judith Martin</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1755, the marriage had produced ten children who were christened in the church where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>Jacobus also settled in the first ward where he acquired <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a>. He  was a <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#7523">freeholder</a> and was appointed firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1735">1735</a>. The <a href="../../census1756.html#177">census of 1756</a> listed him in a "good house" which he shared with his <a href="rihilton7618.html">brother</a>. That document also identified him as a "wampum maker."  On several occasions, he was paid by the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> for going to New York on city business and for other services. In December 1754, he was <a href="../../wills/willisfryer.html">named</a> co-executor of the estate of his "friend" Isaac Fryer. 

 <P>Jacobus Hilton probably died in December 1763 when "widow Hilton's husband" was buried by the church. Subsequent community <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</A> detail the holdings of his widow and sons.</p>
