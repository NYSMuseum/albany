<strong>John Hewson</strong></a> probably was born about 1730. We do not know if he indeed was connected to the <a href="hewson.html">Hewson family</a> of early Albany. One <a href="http://longislandgenealogy.com/hawkins/gp765.htm">source</a> claims that he was "of Prussia."

<p>By the mid-1750s, he had married <a href="../c/anco8616.html">Anna Cook</a>. By 1767, at least four children had been christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. He was a member and supporter of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>This John Hewson was a <a href="../../census1756.html#163">shoemaker</a> who plied his <a href="../../trades/leather.html">trade</a> from a modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">home</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In October 1766, his lot above the English church burying ground was <a href="http://www.phoenixmasonry.org/the_builder_1920_june.htm">referenced</a> on a deed involving the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>.

<p>In 1767, he was identifed as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In August 1776, however, he was one of those confined and then released by the <a href="../../coc.html">Co</a>mmittee of Correspondence.

<p>John Hewson filed a <a href="../../wills/willjohewson.html">will</a> in December 1777. It named his wife and two sons as heirs of his real and personal property. His brother, Daniel, was named as co-executor. He was dead by March 1779 when his widow was listed as the head of their household. Widow Ann survived until at least 1802 when she sold off some of their Albany property.</p>
