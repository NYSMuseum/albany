<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously (but more often Henderer), Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Harmanus Hinderer</strong></a> was born during the late 1760s. He most <a href="../../res/guess.html">likely</a> was the son of newcomers <a href="jahinderer.html">Jacobus</a> and Margarita (Kuhn) Hinderer. Subsequent information <a href="#obit">noted</a> that he was born in Columbia County in about 1768. 

<p>He was a long-time member and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=%22hermanus+henderer%22&source=bl&ots=ksxf9L7IyR&sig=4_q_35KRT-NMGbKk2EpYGmmFxxY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8jzjUILCCaq-0QG1zYCgBw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22hermanus%20henderer%22&f=false">trustee</a> of the First <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. In 1795, church records noted that he was 27 years old. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sOA8AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=%22harmanus+henderer%22&source=bl&ots=qBta0VOhPQ&sig=Y_tPiwZTzeo3IOnVJGptquoErag&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oZPoUMnhCunH0QGFrYDQBQ&sqi=2&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22harmanus%20henderer%22&f=false">1814</a>, he was named church treasurer. He resigned the office in June <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sOA8AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA121&lpg=PA121&dq=%22harmanus+henderer%22&source=bl&ots=qBta0VOhPQ&sig=Y_tPiwZTzeo3IOnVJGptquoErag&hl=en&sa=X&ei=oZPoUMnhCunH0QGFrYDQBQ&sqi=2&ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22harmanus%20henderer%22&f=false">1819</a>.

<p>His wife was named Gertrude. He appears to have fathered a number of children who were christened during the 1790s. 

<p>These Hinderers made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#">second ward</a> where Harmanus pursued the <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a>'s trade. Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his Fox Street property and holdings were valued modestly.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#8416">1800</a>, his household was configured on the city census in the second ward. At that time, his family included five children and another man.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=%22henry+harmanus%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20harmanus%22&f=false">1813</a>, he ("Harmanus Henry") was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> as a shoemaker at 33 <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a>.


<p>Harmanus Hinderer <a href="../../res/death.html">died</a> during a cholera epidemic in July 1832. He had lived 71 years. In November, his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in Albany.</p>
