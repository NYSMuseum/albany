<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Willempie Hansen</strong></a> was born in September 1754. She was the daughter of <a href="ishansen4952.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../b/mabradt4266.html">Maria Bradt</a> Hansen. She grew up as a younger child in the large family of a third ward <a href="../../census1756.html#38">shoemaker</a> who died in 1758 at the age of forty-three. <a href="../../res/sp.html">W</a>illemptje's mother lived on for several decades in a house next to the widow's <a href="../b/bebradt4213.html">father</a> and raised a number of children who would become Albany residents.

<p>In January 1784, she married the much <a href="../../marriages.html#young">older</a> Albany native <a href="../vs/covschaick4019.html">Cornelis Van Schaick</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps their only child was born in 1786 and named for her <a href="../vs/nvschaick3978.html">father-in-law</a>. At that point, Cornelis Van Schaick would have been approaching his fiftieth birthday. However, they may have known eachother for much longer as Cornelis and "Willemje Hansen" were <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">listed</a> as sponsors together at a Hansen family christening in June 1771. 

<p>These Van Schaicks made their <a href="../../census1790.html#4019">home</a> on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in Albany's second ward. Cornelis was the <a href="../../corporation.html#retainers">bellringer</a> for Albany and the sexton at the Dutch church. In <a href="../../census1800.html#4019">1800</a>, only Cornelis and Willempie were counted in this Van Schaick household as their only child had died a year earlier. After that, Cornelis's name was not evident in the community-based record. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22willimpy&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22willimpy&f=false">1813</a>, Willempie Hansen Van Schaick was identified as the head of household in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>. The widow's address was given as 20 <a href="../../streets.html#steuben">Steuben</a>. After that, her name has not been encountered in the community-based record examined to date.  </p>
