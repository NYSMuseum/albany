<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Margarita Hansen</strong></a> was born in April 1757. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="ishansen4952.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../b/mabradt4266.html">Maria Bradt</a> Hansen. She grew up as the youngest child in the third ward home of a shoemaker.

<p>Margarita was less than a year old when her father died in March in 1758. However, her mother would live for several decades as an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4266">householder</a> and the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> neighbor of her <a href="../b/bradt.html">Bradt</a> kin. Two of her brothers would become <a href="behansen4963.html">residents</a> of Albany as well.

<p>In April 1779, she married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">M</a>anor native <a href="../s/tesling5444.html">Teunis Slingerland</a> at the   <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. By 1786, three children had been christened there. 

<p>This Slingerlands family made its home on a <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> farm.

<p>However, Margarita's marriage lasted only a decade as, by 1791, Teunis had re-married, was raising a second family in his hinterland home, and eventually would move inside the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city borders</a> and enter business.

<p>Albany native and mother Margarita Hansen Slingerland had lived less than thirty-five years.</p>
