<strong>Henry Hogan</strong></a> was born in October 1736. He was the son of <a href="wmhogan4397.html">William</a> and <a href="../d/pidouw2166.html">Pietertje Douw</a> Hogan.

<p>He does not appear to have married and probably lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house of his widowed mother thru the 1780s. However, in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4317">1788</a>, his personal property was assessed under his name but within his mother's household.

<p>But, in <a href="../../census1790.html#4317">1790</a>, his first ward household probably included his mother. The property remained in his name on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment</a> of 1799.

<p>Reaching his majority during the late 1750s, the name of this Henry Hogan was not included in Albany annals until <a href="../../org/cc.html#1775">1775</a> when he was appointed firemaster for the first ward. Perhaps he was living on the frontier or some place else beyond the scope of our enquiry. He voted in an Albany election in 1776 and was appointed firemaster again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1780">1780</a>. However, he was "hurt in the line of duty" and had to be replaced.

<p>In May 1775, he was listed as an ensign on the roster of a first ward <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. Later, he was identified as a lieutenant in the first regiment of the Albany militia. Another <a href="http://www.fortklock.com/docnyhistservicemilitiaalb1.htm">source</a> referred to him as a "captain" and stated that he declined to serve after 1780

<p>In March 1778, his slave, "Tom," was among those caught trying to escape to the British in New York.


<P>Henry Hogan died sometime after 1799.</p>
