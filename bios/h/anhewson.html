<strong>Anna Hewson</strong></a> is <a href="http://www.carlstroem.com/2475.htm">said</a> to have been born in January 1794. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="rohewson8349.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../g/elgeyer8615.html">Elizabeth Geyer</a> Hewson. Both her parents died in 1795. We seek information on this orphan's early years.

<p>In April 1814, she was not yet twenty when she married <a href="../p/cafpruyn.html">Casparus F. Pruyn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage would produce ten children.

<p>In March 1818, she was mentioned as a potential heir during the probate of a <a href="../../wills/willthbarret7235.html">will</a> that had been filed in 1788.

<p>These Pruyns lived first on <a href="../../streets.html#market">North Market Street</a> and then on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manor</a> where her husband and his uncle worked for the Van Rensselaers for many years.

<p>They are said to have moved their large family across the Hudson to Bath (today's Rensselaer) after the death of the patroon in 1839.

<p>Anna Hewson Pruyn died in March 1841 at the age of forty-seven. Her husband passed on five years later.
