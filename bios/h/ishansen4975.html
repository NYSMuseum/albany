<strong>Isaac Hansen</strong></a> was born in December 1776. He was the eldest surviving son of Albany residents <a href="johansen4980.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/geersling5421.html">Geertruy Slingerlands</a> Hansen.

<p>In July 1798, he married Albany native <a href="../c/jacooper487.html">Jane Cooper</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage may have produced six children between 1801 and 1811.

<p>These Hansens made their home in the third ward from where Isaac practiced <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a>. He was admitted to the bar in several places including Albany and <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nygreen2/beers_history_of_greene_county_outline_of_greene_county.htm">Greene</a>   (1800) counties. In 1810, he posted <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IfgaAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA382&lpg=PA382&dq=%22isaac+hansen%22+law&source=bl&ots=LiieoQwdtE&sig=Nlnee40ewldmhnaJ2wLDqlengaA&hl=en&ei=Lq0SS9mCCo_KlAfA_oibBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBQQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20hansen%22%20law&f=false">bail</a> on behalf of one of his fellow <a href="../y/jvnyates.html">attorneys</a>. Beginning in 1813, city directories <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22hansen+isaac%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hansen%20isaac%22&f=false">listed</a> him as an attorney at 23 Steuben Street. 

<p>After apparently <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">renting</a> quarters, in <a href="../../census1800.html#4975">1800</a>, Isaac Hansen's budding household was configured on the city census. Beginning in 1812, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> in the second ward. He was re-elected several times. He also served as a magistrate, justice of the peace, and as master of the chancery court. 

<p>In 1802, he was the secretary of the <a href="http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3738392">Albany Republican</a> committee. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a>. He was among the initial stakeholders in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA704&lpg=PA704&dq=%22isaac+hansen&source=bl&ots=m0e2Tx9FjU&sig=DoZfAmT763HYcnitKRepY3JAQQI&hl=en&ei=qKUSS6r1KcPOlAfThtmkBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CB8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20hansen%22%&f=false">Albany Theater</a> that opened in 1813.  In May 1815, he was <a http://books.google.com/books?id=nWkJAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA704&lpg=PA704&dq=%22isaac+hansen%22+albany&source=bl&ots=m0e2Tx9FjU&sig=DoZfAmT763HYcnitKRepY3JAQQI&hl=en&ei=qKUSS6r1KcPOlAfThtmkBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CB8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20hansen%22%20albany&f=false href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA483&lpg=PA483&dq=%22isaac+hansen%22+albany&source=bl&ots=4QKp0uiQWP&sig=wh3Oa8h1AXoMEoj7CISKpnQ4J84&hl=en&ei=h6ISS7yZF46XlAehhcSOBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20hansen%22&f=false">named</a> co-executor of the estate of his brother-in-law.  He also was a board member and trustee of civic associations.
<p>Isaac Hansen lost his wife when Jane died in January 1815 at the age of thirty three. He <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153&dq=%22isaac+hansen%22+albany&source=bl&ots=SpaxUHsjvj&sig=p8Y9f8MFVgN0a78WKZWfNwT0ePk&hl=en&ei=oKESS66ADonllQfL25CdBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false">died</a> three years later and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> alongside her in the Dutch church plot. He had lived only forty-years. Letters of Administration were issued on his estate in March 1818. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rkobAQAAIAAJ&pg=PT396&lpg=PT396&dq=%22isaac+hansen%22+slingerland&source=bl&ots=BsxnOwVN9Y&sig=APqNg5yULp5K96RrqLNgLixxuaQ&hl=en&ei=pJUSS5SpFcaMlAe4r4GPBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CB4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20hansen%22%20slingerland&f=false">1830</a>, his <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a> property was being offered for sale.
