      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Bernardus Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born 
        in April 1744. He was a younger son of <a href="hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick</a> 
        and <a href="../b/subradt4279.html">Susanna Bradt</a> Hallenbeck. He grew 
        up in a very large family on his father's property that stretched across 
        the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. In 1764, 
        he was <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">named</a> to share 
        in his father's substantial estate. 
      <p>In March 1766, he married Albany native Cornelia <a href="../c/coclark.html">(Neeltie) 
        Clark</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        the mid-1780s, eight children had been christened in Albany. 
      <p>At that time, he took his place in the Albany community. Early in <a href="../../solconst.html#5249">1766</a>, 
        he joined his neighbors in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons 
        of Liberty. His first ward property was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#5249">May 1767</a>, 
        his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. 
      <p>In his thirties during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for 
        Independence, we seek information on his activities beyond occasionally 
        serving as a courier for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a>. 
        Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5249">land 
        bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5249">1788</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> holdings were accorded a modest assessment. In <a href="../../census1790.html#5249">1790</a>, 
        his houshold included just four people. </p>
      Bernardus Hallenbeck died in October 1792 and was buried from his church. 
      His widow continued to live in their <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South 
      Pearl Street home</a> for a number of years.
