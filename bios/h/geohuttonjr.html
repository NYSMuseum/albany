<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>George Hutton, Jr.</strong></a> may have been <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/103029.htm">born</a> early in 1774 or perhaps in <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rclarke/page1/hutton2.htm">1782</a>. However, <a href="../../res/ts.html">traditional sources</a> agree that he was the son of <a href="geohutton.html">George</a> and Anna Marie Viele Hutton and probably was born in New York City prior to the war. By the late 1770s, his parents had re-located to Albany. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his adolescence and early adulthood.

<p>In January 1801, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">identified</a> as a member of an Albany <a href"../../firemasters.html">fire</a> company.

<p>His wife, Elizabeth (<a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rclarke/page1/hutton2.htm">perhaps</a> Eliza Smedes), joined the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a> in 1814. Their names have not been encountered in available documents of other early <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>.

<p>His father died in 1806 and George Jr. succeeded him in the Albany-based business George Sr. had built with George's older brother, silversmith <a href="ishutton.html">Isaac Hutton</a>. However, we cannot be certain that community-based information for "George Hutton" dated before 1806 refers to the father or his son.

<p>As early as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a>, George Jr. was known as a merchant in the city of Albany. The membership lists of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a> referred to him as a silversmith. In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#gh">1808</a>, he was among those invited to the funeral of an Albany neighbor. 

<p>The city census for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> configured his household with two boys, five girls, a slave, and George and his wife.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22hutton&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hutton&f=false">1813</a>, city directories listed his resident next to that of his brother on lower <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a> and their store on South Market Street.
 
<p>By 1820, the name of George Hutton, Jr. had dropped from Albany rolls. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information his later life and passing. </p>
