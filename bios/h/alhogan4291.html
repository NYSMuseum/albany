<strong>Alida Hogan</strong></a> was born in January 1734. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="juhogan4372.html">Jurrian</a> and <a href="../b/mabeekman3874.html">Maria Beekman</a> Hogan. She grew up as part of a large family in a merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>In August 1757, she married Andries Van Schaick at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. After two children, her husband died in February 1761. She was called his widow in the <a href="../../wills/willjuhogan.html">will</a> of her parents filed in 1763. In 1773, she became the third wife of <a href="../b/anebradt4204.html">Anthony E. Bradt</a>. Their child was christened in 1777. She was a member, pewholder, and frequent baptism sponsor at the Dutch church.

<p>From the 1760s thru the end of the century, she was identified as the owner of a number of properties (houses and lots in various locations). 

<p>Anthony E. Bradt was dead by 1785. The house and holdings of the "widow of Anthony Bradt" were valued on the third ward assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4291">1788</a>.

<p>Alida Hogan Van Schaick was last noted on assessment rolls in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> and 1802. We seek defining information on her passing.</p>
