<P><a href="#sources"><b>Thomas J. Hun</b></a> was born in February 1736. He was the eldest and only surviving son of Albany mainstays <a href="johun4776.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../w/anwinne2815.html"> Anna Winne</a> Hun. He grew up in a third ward home that he later <a href="../../wills/willjohun.html">inherited</a> from his father. By the terms of the will, he was to share the <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> property with his <a href="elhun4800.html">sister</a> for five years.</p>
		
<p>In August 1761, he married Albany native <a href="../w/elwendell2860.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps because the parents were somewhat older than the norm, only two children were baptized at the church where Thomas and Elizabeth were prominent members.</p>

<p>Thomas J. Hun was a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4781">merchant</a> whose Albany property extended from Market Street to the river. Eventually, he also owned acreage across the Hudson and into the Mohawk Valley. He served as firemaster and was elected asistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> in 1764. In 1773, he was elected alderman. He was active in committee work and performed a number of contract services for the city government. After the war, he was elected again to the city council and served for another  decade. His large, <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">new home</a> home was an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#4781">landmark</a>. By <a href="../../census1800.html#4781">1800</a>, his married <a href="abhun4770.html">son</a> and budding family had joined Thomas J. Hun's Market Street household. 




<p>Thomas J. Hun filed a will in December 1800. It identified him as "Thomas Hun, Esq." It named his wife and two children. The <a href="anhun4771.html">daughter</a> married Reverend John Basset - the last dominie of the nearby old Dutch church. He <a href="http://www.vandorland.nl/Engels/Genealogy/EEN/ae_00114.htm">died</a> in November 1802 at the age of 66. The will passed probate in August 1814!</p>
