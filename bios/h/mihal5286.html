<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Michael Hallenbeck</strong></a> lived in Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a> of the American Revolution. He does not seem to be closely related to the mainline early Albany <a href="hallenbeck.html">family</a> descended from New Netherland pioneer <a href="cahallenbeck5214.html">Casper Jacobse</a>. However, <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22michael+hallenbeck%22+genealogy+">plau</a>sible <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rclarke/page1/halenbec.htm">birth scenarios</a> for Michael Hallenbeck (as a member of the greater NY family) from south of Albany have been encountered. We seek defining information on Michael's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>We have not yet connected him to a spouse or to family-based information.

<p>In March 1765, the "City Records" <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=%22michael+hallenbeck%22+cromme&source=bl&ots=wygF8Vyglw&sig=Sj8sAr1m6DOfO9acK22L06THFzE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Cj1sVejCMojYggS6yIO4CQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22michael%20hallenbeck%22%20cromme&f=false">referenced</a> the "house and ground" formerly held by Michael Hallenbeck. Also mentioned were the six "enfenced" acres west of a small branch of the Cromme Kill now in his (Hallenbeck's") possession. That transaction refers to a lease to last for twenty-one years.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5286">March 1779</a>, the Albany assessment roll for the second ward valued the house and lot of "Michal Hallenbeck" moderately. A similar assessment was levied on the roll dated <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October 1779</a>.

<p>In April 1785, the Albany newspaper <a href="../../doc/nn1.html#hollen">reported</a> that two men had opened a school "in the house occupied by Michael Hollenbake" who had "left keeping tavern." This reference is <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzling</a> and we seek more information on his Albany life. However, his name has not been encountered after 1785.


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, three Michael Hallenbeck-headed households in different jurisdictions within Albany County were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dbDiRQ2YOHYC&pg=PA246&lpg=PA246&dq=%22hallenbeck%22y&source=bl&ots=PaN2U-RHmq&sig=VNtCJC-I-pflMsAFu2zGAlhLrl0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VEJsVYKmM4ihgwSswIDoCQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22hallenbeck&f=false">configured</a> on the first Federal census for New York State.

<p>Past diminishing returns and still without answers to basic demographic questions on the life of Albany resident Michael Hallenbeck, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>.

<p>In 1770, a "Michael Hallenbeck" was <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/livstn/st_johns_lutheran.htm">listed</a> among the earliest members of a Lutheran church in what later became Columbia County. That individual (most likely not this Albany subject) was a descendant of the "<a href="http://tera-3.ul.cs.cmu.edu/NASD/d23d381a-642a-4cb1-bd42-5373f518ed1d/lemur/6529.sgml">Albany Dutch family</a>" and a prominent (notorious as a tenant rioter during the 1750s and 60s) resident of that locale. Perhaps, he died in 1766.</div>
