<strong>Daniel J. Hewson</strong></a> was born in November 1755. He was the son of <a href="johewson2329.html">John</a> and <a href="../c/anco8616.html">Hannah Cook</a> Hewson. He grew up in a small family in a shoemaker's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In 1777, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjohewson.html">will</a> filed by his father. He seems to have been known as "Daniel J. Hewson" - presumably to prevent confusion with <a href="dahewson8623.html">Daniel Hewson, Jr.</a> and other Daniel Hewsons living in Albany at that time.. 

<p>In March 1779, his personal property was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">valued</a> under the first ward household of his widowed mother. The first ward assessment for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8616">1788</a> is under the name of "Daniel Hewson and mother" with his brother <a href="cahewson8621.html">Casparus</a> living next door. The census in <a href="../../census1790.html#ah">1790</a> showed only the home of Ann Hewson with four men and four females in that part of the first ward.

<p>His wife was Elizabeth Geyer. Between 1787 and 1799, four children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. Also, a daughter was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> in July 1790. Church records identified him as a "carman." Hopefully coincidentally, "another" Elizabeth Geyer married <a href="../h/rohewson8349.html">Robert Hewson</a> about that time.

<p>One of at least three individuals named Daniel Hewson and living in Albany at that time, we resist assigning qualitative infomation for the time being!

<p>Daniel J. Hewson died in March 1826 at the age of seventy-one.
