<P><A href="#sources"><B>Lucas Luycasse Hooghkerk</B></A> probably was born about 1660. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on his origins and on when he first came to Albany. He seems to have been the first "<a href="hoog.html">Hooghkerk</a>" to become an Albany resident. </P>

<P>In February 1686, "Lucas Lucasz Van Hooghkerken" <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part1.html#marriage">married</a> Hendrickje Jans at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both were identified as of "New Albany." Hendrickje died after bearing two children. In November 1692, widower Lucas married <a href="../m/jumarselis741.html">Judik Marselis</a>. That marriage produced eight more children who were baptized in the Albany church between 1693 and 1712. He was a church member and  baptism sponsor. 

   <p>In 1697, his modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>  was listed 
        on a <a href="../../census1697.html#015">census</a> of Albany householders. 
        After <a href="#trade">unsuccessfully seeking</a> to trade for furs, in 1728 he leased land (two acres) on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> for use as a brick kiln. In 1730, that lease was set for fifty years. His descendants continued that business through the end of the century.</p>

      <p>In 1709, his first ward property was <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3603">valued</a> on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, he was identified as a private in Gerrit Roseboom's Albany company    of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">county militia</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3603">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.</p> 

<p>Patriarch of the Albany Hooghkerk family, Lucas Luycasse Hooghkerk died in February 1741. He was buried from the Albany Dutch church where he was a long-time member.</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of Lucas Luycasse <a href="hoog.html">Hooghkerk</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography

<p><a name=trade></a>In 1699, the city council reported that he did not possess <b>freedom of the city</b> (unique rights of residency including the ability to trade) - probably because he had been born outside the boundaries of Albany/Beverwyck. In 1701, he was ordered to stop <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> until he qualified (by virtue of freemanship or a license).</p>
