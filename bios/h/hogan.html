      <P>The <a href="#sources"><b>Hogan family </b></a> of early Albany traces its 
        roots to the marriage of <a href="../irish.html">Ir</a>ish-born soldier-turned-innkeeper 
        <a href="wmhogan4396.html">William Hogan</a> and his wife Albany native 
        <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">Martina Becker</a> Hogan. They came 
        to Albany before 1700 and established a family that persisted in the city 
        and its hinterland for many generations. Three roughly contemporary "William 
        Hogans" (the <a href="wmhogan4398.html">younger</a> and <a href="wmhogan4397.html">Jr.</a>) 
        complicate delineation of this family history.</p>

<p><a name=var></a>Name <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iations: Hogan, Hogen, Hogil, Hoghill, Hoge, Hoogun, and even Logan - the <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelling variations</a> in the multi-language historical record are numerous. Jurrian and Jurian are Germanic versions of George, which has been encountered more frequently eighteenth century community-based record after the 1760s. </p>

<p>During the first half of the eighteenth century, "<a href="anhogan4314.html">Hannah Hogan</a>" became the second <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=WdwNExWb7_QC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=2nd+albany+&source=bl&ots=aNJENtVapP&sig=8OYcIyRzfbHDEGaSs-dMqwE_doc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiuodrrtf7KAhXDFT4KHaskDHQ4HhDoAQggMAE#v=onepage&q=2nd&f=false">wife</a> of Albany resident <a href="../d/vodouw2231.html">Volkert Douw, Jr.</a>  

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#96">1756</a>, two Hogan households (merchant <a href="juhogan4372.html">Jurrian Hogan</a>  and his <a href="wmhogan4398.html">blacksmith son</a>) were listed on the city census.</p>

      <p>Following the death of her Anglican pastor husband in 1784, <a href="mahogan4379.html">Martina 
        Hogan Brown</a> brought her family home to Albany where her household 
        was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#4379">1790</a>. 
        At that <a href="../../census1790.html#1118">time</a>, her widowed sister 
        <a href="mahogan1118.html">Mary Hogan Charles</a> lived nearby.
		
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, <a href="hehogan4317.html">Henry Hogan</a>'s household was configured on the census in the first ward while the household of <a href="juhogan4374.html">George Hogan</a> was enumerated in the southern part of Watervliet that soon would be called Bethlehem. No Hogan named households were listed on the city census in 1800.</p>

      <p>The first Albany city directory published in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=%22hixon%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hixon%22&f=false">1813</a> 
        did not list any Hogan-named addresses in the city. By 1815, the Hogan 
        name had disappeared from the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.</p>
