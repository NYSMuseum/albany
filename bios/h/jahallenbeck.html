<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Hallenbeck</strong></a> was identified as a son (and co-executor) in the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> filed by <a href="hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick Hallenbeck</a> of Albany in March 1764. That reference is the sole connecting source encountered for "Jacob" so far in our sweep of the community-based record. However, family-based sources have fixed his birth/baptism date as October 1736 or 1746 <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/hallenbeck.html">for</a> his son <a href="../../res/sp.html">James</a> Halenbeck. We seek <a href="../../res/origins.html">def</a>ining demographic information on this individual who <a href="../../res/guess.html">may well be </a> be the stakeholder whose life and property are described below.

      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a>, James was named constable for 
        the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. On the same day, he was 
        chosen high constable. 
      <p>In 1767, Jacob Halenbeck was identified as a private on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company based in the first ward. 

<p>In September 1772, "James Halenbeek and <a href="../b/eybradt4361.html">Ytje Bratt</a>" were married at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, the partners 
        were identified as single people of "this county." By 1779, perhaps four children had been christened in Albany.
		
<p>During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jaha">1779</a>, and again in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jaha">1788</a> the <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> holdings of one "James <a href="../../res/sp.html">Hal</a>nback" (probably lots in the "Hallenbeck plot") were valued modestly along with the other heirs of Hendrick on <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment rolls. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jaha">1790</a>, the household of James Halenbeck was enumerated on the census for that part of the first ward and included one male over sixteen, three boys under sixteen, a woman, and one slave.   

<p>Subsequently, several, same-named individuals married and had adult lives in Albany and its hinterland during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

<p>Without defining demographic parameters, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the story of Jacob and/or James Hallenbeck a one-time resident of the city of Albany.</p>
