<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elsie Hun</b></a> was born in March 1733. She was the daughter of Albany residents Johannes and Anna Winne Hun.</p>


<p>By 1757, she had married skipper <a href="../l/phlansing3648.html">Philip Lansing</a>. Over the next twenty years, their eight children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>By the terms of her father's <a href="../../wills/willjohun.html">will</a>, probated in 1776, she was to live in Johannes Hun's house for five years (implying that her family was living there in 1764 when the will was written), and then receive a payment from her brother in addition to the half share of her estate originally bequeathed.</p>

<p>In 1790, she was accounted for on the <a href="../../census1790.html#3648">census</a> in their large third ward household.

<p>After 1790, the name of Elsie Hun Lansing dropped from community rolls!</p>
