<P>One time Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Robert Hurst</strong></a> was born prior to 1755. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to the city. A number of same-named regional contemporaries dictate caution.

<p>An adult during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war years</a>, we seek information on his <a href="http://archive.org/stream/3rdpennsylvaniaarch23harruoft/3rdpennsylvaniaarch23harruoft_djvu.txt">possible</a> Revolutionary War service and any subsequent pension.

<p>His name does not appear on the census for <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> in New York State. However, the Albany city assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> listed his "shop" in the first ward with a modest tax. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, the second ward assessment valued his two lots on Lion Street lightly with the notation "non resident".  In <a href="../../census1800.html#8614">1800</a>, his first ward household included three children or adolescents and a man an woman aged 26-45.

<p>He appears to have been married but his name does not appear in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In 1801, he was among the charter members of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. However, we have not been able to ascertain his occupation/craft/trade!

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22robert+hurst%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=hurst&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed him at 206 Lion Street. However, his name did not appear in subsequent directories. Perhaps the naming of <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/hurst.html">Hurst</a> Road in Guilderland and/or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilderland_Center,_New_York">Guilderland Center</a> (where a number of former city <a href="nihilton.html">residents</a> relocated during this period) is related to this individual.

<p>Robert Hurst had died by February 1820 when his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in Albany County.

<p>With unresolved issues and past diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
