<strong>Isaac Hogan</strong></a> was born in November 1742. He was the son of <a href="wmhogan4398.html">William</a>, Jr. and <a href="../l/sulansing3682.html">Susanna Lansing</a> Hogan. He grew up in a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> blacksmith's home as the eldest son in a large family.

<p>In November 1767, he married <a href="../g/magerr6026.html">Maria Gerritse</a>. By 1771, three children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, none of them were named in the will he filed in January 1773.

<p>Like his father, Isaac Hogan was a blacksmith who also had a shop in the first ward. His father lived for many years but moved out to the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> by the late 1780s. Perhaps, Isaac succeeded to William's smithy.

<p>In 1766, he joined his neighbors in <a href="../../solconst.html#4320">signing</a> a constitution for the Albany Sons of Liberty. That same year, his house and property near the waterfront were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">valued</a> on an Albany assessment roll.


<p>Isaac Hogan filed a <a href="../../wills/willishogan4320.html">will</a> in January 1773. He acknowledged that he was sickly. The will passed probate in November 1774. He had lived only thirty-two years. </p>
