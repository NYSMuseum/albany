<strong>Anna Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born  in March 1704. She was the daughter of <a href="ichallenbeck5215.html">Isaac Casperse</a> and <a href="../b/dobosch2037.html">Dorothy Bosch</a> Hallenbeck. She grew up in a large family on her father's large piece of  property that spread across the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">south side</a> of Albany.

<p>In November 1708, "<a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>annah" was among the heirs named in the <a href="../../wills/willichallenbeck.html">will</a>  filed by her father. However, the story of her childhood is in question as Isaac Casperse died shortly thereafter and her mother soon was living in New York City. 

<P>In February 1727, Anna married <a href="../b/bebogert6058.html">Benjamin Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1746, as many as ten children had been christened in Albany with the first one baptized just four months after the wedding.

<p>This Bogert family also lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Benjamin was a carpenter and Albany mainstay well into the 1760s.

<p>Anna Hallenbeck Bogert was deceased in September 1767 when her husband was granted letters of administration on her estate. But, <a href="http://www.klippelfamily.com/bogard/7201.htm">perhaps</a> she died in 1749.</p>
