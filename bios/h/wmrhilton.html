<strong>William R. Hilton</strong></a> was born in March 1732. He was the son of <a href="rihilton7618.html">Richard/Ryckert</a> and <a href="../b/maben7316.html">Maria Bennewe</a> Hilton. The existence of several William Hiltons during this individual's life span complicates the assignment of qualitative information.

<p>In April 1754, a marriage license was granted to William Hilton and <a href="../b/elbrooks343.html">Elizabeth Brooks</a>. Between October 1753 and March 1768, those parents witnessed seven children being christened with familiar first names in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In February 1778, William R. Hilton of Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gMDkwT1hAMYC&pg=PA824&lpg=PA824&dq=%22william+hilton%22+albany&source=bl&ots=xTilcCwROW&sig=oQgDPClXum5ayOCfKX5-fHVgokc&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA824,M1">petitioned</a> Governor for damages done to his property by the Army in 1777. He identified himself as a cartman and stated that he had kept and improved a house and garden on the <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">hill</a> in Albany and that the forraging soldiers appropriated and destroyed all of his holdings. His crops lost included 500 cabbages, carrots, parsnips, and beets. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wrh">1788</a>, the meager holdings of "William R. Hilton" were included on the assessment roll for the first ward. Also living in that house was Richard Hilton Jr.  
 
<p>These Hiltons probably settled in Albany near the homes of their families. In <a href="../../census1790.html#wh">1790</a>, the household of a "William Hilton" and his wife was enumerated on the census at the end of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#wh">1800</a>, an older couple, was living alone in a similarly located household on the first ward census. After that, specific community-based references to William Hilton cease.

<p>The "wife of William Hilton" died in at the end of 1812. Her age was given as seventy-nine - making her a good fit for the woman married to William Hilton in 1753. 


<p>William R. Hilton died in June 1823. His final age was given as ninety-four years, three months, and twenty-two days. </p>
