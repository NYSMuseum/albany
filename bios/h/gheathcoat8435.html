<P><a href="#sources"><strong>George Heathcoat</strong></a> was born in England during the first half of the seventeenth century. He was the son of Gilbert and Ann Heathcoat. He may have spent some time on the island of Jamaica.

<p>But, by <a href="../../census1679.html#8435">1679</a>, he was counted among Albany's householders. His property was at two locations on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>During these years, he was identified as a mariner on a number of occasions Later, he would be known as a merchant of New York City. He also was called a <a href="http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/pa/bucks/history/local/davis/davis05.txt">Quaker</a>.

<p>In March 1684, Albany court records stated that he owed taxes. Later that year, he sold his house to <a href="../s/rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a>. After that, his name dropped from Albany records. 

<p>George Heathcoat filed a will in November 1710. It stated that he was a resident of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a merchant, and "sick and weak." Bequests were made to his grandchildren. The balance of the estate was intended for his nephew, Caleb Heathcoat of New York. The will passed probate on November 24.</p>
