<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Hunt</strong></a> was an Albany resident in <a href="../../census1800.html#8601">1800</a>. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>Cautioned by existence of a number of same-named contemporaries, <a href="http://hobbits8.net/getperson.php?personID=I110&tree=PLH">perhaps</a> this individual was the William Hunt born in Albany County in December 1768. Then, in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his father might have been William Hunt, a resident of Cambridge in old <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany</a> County. From cemetery records, that individual married "Syncha (Rachel) Leigh" in newly formed Washington County in February 1795. By 1805, the marriage had produced five children. That William Hunt died and was buried in Washington County in 1848.

<p>However, a William Hunt was a resident of Albany during the above lifetime. In <a href="../../census1800.html#8601">1800</a>, the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> census showed that two men between 26 and 45, a girl, a young lady, and a women over 45 lived in William Hunt's household. His was among four Hunt-named households configured in the city. The assessment roll for 1799 shows a number of Hunt named properties (but not for William) on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. A decade later, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> configured the household of William J. Hunt similarly.



<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22hunt+william%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hunt%20william%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed the home of William Hunt, a shoemaker, at 41 Sand Street. Subsequent directories called William I./J. Hunt a jeweller and living at 61 Beaver Street. However, we cannot <a href="../../res/guess.html">say</a> that those individuals were the William Hunt listed on the census in 1800.

<p>During the 1830s and 40s, Albany printer Joel Munsell <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=K6wFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA564&lpg=PA564&dq=%22william+hunt%22+albany&source=bl&ots=Z88eGbpHQn&sig=Bz8nv_2W5F8aZFydqQ88-7MG4BY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0FQFUfTHNuPC0QHNmICgAQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22william%20hunt%22%20albany&f=false">published</a> a number of items authored or compiled by William Hunt. Two sme-named individuals may be at risk in those directories.

 
<p>We seek defining information on his later life and passing. With so many outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding the Albany William Hunt, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
