<P><a href="#sources"><b>Daniel Hale</b></a> probably was born during the 1740s. He first appeared on the late colonial period <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany         County</a> landscape as a storekeeper and sometime surveyor along the North Hudson. As several same-named individuals are at risk, we are cautious in approaching his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>.</p>

<p>By the outbreak of the Revolutionary war, he had associated himself with General <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> and went on to <a href="../../inprog.html">serve</a> the American army in the supply department. He was called "Major" - although record of his commission has been elusive! In 1782, he was identified as the manager of a distillery in Poughkeepsie. However, by war's end, he had settled in Albany.</p>

<p>About 1783, he married a young <a href="../d/cadyckman2128.html">Cathalina Dyckman</a>. The marriage produced several children but was anything but a happy one. Sickly and suffering from emotional problems, Caty Hale became a drug-dependant invalid who finally retreated to the care of her family in New York and Westchester. Although her children were baptized at the Dutch church, his preference was for <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church - where he was a church officer.</p>

<p>His first notable Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#8306">home</a> was on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a> - probably in or adjacent to the large building he shared with his partner, <a href="../r/jorobison422.html">John Robison</a>. He owned other Albany real estate parcels as well including the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> flats that later housed his distillery.</p>

<p>Postwar Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspapers</a> identified "Major Hale" as a merchant in partnership with John Robison. They advertized European and East Indian imported goods at their store on the northwest corner of Market and State Streets. But, his water-level holdings were damaged in the great <a href="../../fire.html">fires</a>         of the 1790s. Although he seems to have maintained his store at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%22hale+daniel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hale%20daniel%22&f=false">5</a> Market Street, by <a href="../../census1800.html#8306">1800</a>, he had relocated his residence to 70 North Pearl Street where he lived with his servants until his death.

<p>During the 1790s, Hale <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2hp7rJb9mqEC&pg=PA585&lpg=PA585&dq=%22daniel+hale%22+albany&source=bl&ots=XZ8U416OW8&sig=jKvvd4Teo7JvPw966dcxmB5xmOI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qKkRT6etLujy0gHDnbGIAw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTge#">en</a>joyed the patronage of Alexander Hamilton and was a substantial <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=2hp7rJb9mqEC&pg=PA522&lpg=PA522&dq=%22daniel+hale%22+albany&source=bl&ots=XZ8U416OW8&sig=jKvvd4Teo7JvPw966dcxmB5xmOI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qKkRT6etLujy0gHDnbGIAw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBTge#">supplier</a> of the US government and particular the Army.
		 
<p>Daniel Hale was a prominent participant in Albany's emergence as one of the first directors of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>, the Albany Water Works, the <a href="../../org/albanylib.html">Library</a>, and other community-based organizations.</p>

<p>Businessman and entrepreneur, Hale was a notable Albany <a href="../../doc/1788afc.html">Federalist</a>. 

<p>He also was appointed to a number of New York State commissions and offices. In 1798, he was named Secretary of State for New York State.</p>

<p>He served a term in the State Assembly in 1806-07. 

<p>Daniel Hale died in Albany in September 1821. Living with her downstate family for many years prior to Hale's passing, his erstwhile wife survived until 1829.</p>
