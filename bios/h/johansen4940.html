<strong>Johannes Hansen</strong></a> was born in August 1674. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="johansen4937.html">Hans Hendricks</a> and <a href="../d/evdemeyer.html">Eva de Meyer</a> Hansen. He grew up in a large family in a landmark home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. He was named in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&jtp=210">will</a> filed by his father just before he died in 1694. After the death of his father, he seems to have taken charge of the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">family bible</a>.

<p>In 1697, he was <a href="../../census1697.html#077">alone</a> in a house next to that of his widowed <a href="../../census1697.html#076">mother</a>.  Two years later, he joined his <a href="hehansen4939.html">brother</a>, the mayor, in signing a community-based <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4940">oath</a> of allegiance to the King of England.  During the early 1700s, he served on Albany juries. His <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> property was valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html"#4940>1720</a>, the name of "Johannes Hansen" appeared on a list of second ward freeholders. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#jh">1742</a>, he may have been the Johannes Hansen listed among the freeholders of the third ward.

<p>In March 1702, he married <a href="../d/sadf4714.html">Sara De Foreest</a> of New York City at her father's Albany house. According to the Hansen bible, <a href="../l/jlydius4614.html">Domine Lydius</a> performed the ceremony. By 1729, the marriage may have <a href="../../drc.html">produced</a> a large number of <a href="../../children.html">children</a>. 

<p>Johannes Hansen lost his wife in September 1746. Her died in May 1748 and was buried from the Albany church.
