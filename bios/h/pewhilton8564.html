      <P>Mostly <a href="../../res/sp.html">kn</a>own as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter 
        W. Hilton</strong></a>, this individual probably was born early in 1745 
        and christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        on February 17. He was the son of <a href="wmhiltonjr.html">William</a> 
        and Margaret Jones Hilton. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> home of a prominent, <a href="../anglo.html">Eng</a>lish-speaking 
        carpenter. 
      <p>In September 1772, he married <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> Elizabeth <a href="#echts">Echts</a>, an 
        Albany-born spinster. By 1790, the marriage had produced a number of children 
        who were christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican 
        church where he was a member. However, by <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">1815</a>, 
        he was being identified as a deacon at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>By the mid-1760s, Peter W. had reached adulthood and was mentioned along 
        with his father on first ward <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">tax 
        rolls</a>. At that time, he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company as <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#8564">well</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, 
        he was named constable for the first ward. During the 1790s, he served 
        in <a href="../../firemasters.html">fire</a> companies in the first ward. 
      <p>In his early thirties at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> 
        in 1775, Peter W. Hilton might have been expected to have played an active 
        part in the crusade for American liberties. However, so far, the record 
        has shown only that he contributed toward supplies for the relief of Ticonderoga 
        in 1775. In November 1780, he was <a href="../../cddc.html">identified</a> 
        as a cooper when he posted one hundred pounds bail for a disaffected neighbor. 
        His name <a href="../../inprog.html">seems</a> to have been absent from 
        the obvious military rosters or bounty <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">lists</a> 
        from that era. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8564">1779</a>, his personal 
        property was valued under the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#wihi">real 
        property</a> of his father in the first ward. William Hilton probably 
        died within a few years of that assessment leaving several sons as residents 
        of the first ward. 
<p>After the war, he continued to live in a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8564">modest</a> home at 40 Beaver Street where he plied the <a href="../../trades/wood.html">cooper</a>'s trade. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8564">1790</a>, his first ward 
        home included seven people. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, 
        a list of freeholders in the first ward identified him as a cooper. In 
        <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, two householders identified 
        simply as "Peter Hilton" were listed on the census in the first ward. 
        <a href="../../census1800.html#8564">One</a> of them counted only one 
        young man while the <a href="../../census1800.html#7235">other</a> housed 
        (next to the home of <a href="../b/thbarret7235.html">Thomas Barret</a> 
        a fellow cooper and long time neighbor) four people and the adult male 
        resident would have fit the age parameters of this subject. However, in 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, Peter W. Hilton's Albany 
        household was composed of seven people. Beginning in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22rensselaer+westerlo%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=hilton&f=false">1813</a>, city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> listed his Beaver Street address for many years.
		 
      <p>In March 1813, he witnessed the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PP1&lpg=PP1&q=peter+hilton#PPA455,M1">will</a> 
        of Albert Van Der Zee of Bethlehem. We seek information on the final three 
        decades of his life. 
<p>Later in life, he probably moved into a family residence located west of Albany. Peter W. Hilton <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA252&lpg">died</a> 
        in Guilderland on January 26, 1835. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> 
        in Albany County in October. According to the newspaper notice, this Albany 
        native had lived ninety-two years - the first eighty-four of them in the 
        city.</p>
