<P><a href="#sources"><b>Margarita Hogan</b></a> was born during the summer of 1700 and christened in the Dutch church on August 4. She was the daughter of soldier-turned-innkeeper <a href="wmhogan4396.html">William Hogan</a> and his wife, <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">Martina Becker</a> Hogan. She grew up in a mid-sized family among the former garrison soldiers who had settled in the first ward.  </p>

<p>By 1725, she had become the wife of a somewhat younger <a href="dihun4774.html">Dirck Hun</a>. By 1741, five of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Later, she joined her husband at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.</p>

<P>In September 1732, she was bequeathed a share of the testator's "slaves" in the <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">will</a> of her father. 

<p>These Huns raised their family on Court Street near the <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">city hall</a>. Dirck was known as a carpenter. They were Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#265">mainstays</a> for several decades. 

<p>Margarita probably had lost her husband by <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4374">1779</a> when the "Widow of Dirck Hun" was listed on a city assessment roll as the owner of a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property.  A decade <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4374">later</a>, she was living in the first ward and was identified as widow "Hunn and son John" with Dirck Hun and two others taxed as boarders there as well.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#4374">1790</a>, that household was configured on the first ward Albany census.</p>

<p>In May 1795, William Hun paid for the burial of his mother. Margarita Hogan Hun had lived in Albany for almost ninety-five years!</p>
