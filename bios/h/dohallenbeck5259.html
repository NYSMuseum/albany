<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Dorothea Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born in July 1723. She was the daughter of <a href="hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/subradt4279.html">Susanna Bradt</a> Hallenbeck. Probably named for her paternal <a href="../b/dobosch2037.html">grandmother</a>, she grew up an older daughter in the large family of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside property holder. 

<p>In March 1764, "Dorothy Halenbeek" was the second of eight living children identified as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>In 1759, she was identified as the daughter of Hendrick and as the owner of seat 3 in pew 65 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Between 1749 and 1762, she witnessed a number of christenings of family members at the church. In 1768, that seat was transferred to young <a href="../f/safryer8139.html">Sara Fryer</a>. 

<p>Dorothea Hallenbeck does not appear to have married or to have raised children of her own. She probably had passed on by 1768 when her pew was transferred. Perhaps she did not live to reach her fiftieth birthday.</p>
