<strong>Hendrick Hansen</strong></a> was born in Albany in 1665, the son of Beverwyck trader <a href="johansen4937.html">Hans Hendrickse</a> 
            and Eva Gillis de Meyer. He followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. That business often took the young man into the Indian country and thus postponed the start of his own family.</p>

          <p>In Albany to stay by 1691, Hendrick was appointed <a href="../../org/cc.html#1691">constable</a> and then high constable 
            - designations that signalled his entry into community life. In 1692, 
            he wed <a href="../vd/dvdam6351.html">Debora Van Dam</a> - the only 
            daughter of an Albany carpenter. Shortly thereafter, the couple moved 
            into the Hansen home on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
            Street</a> where they raised seven children. He may have been the "Hendrick Haes" whose household was configured on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1697.html#022">1697</a>.  Although a <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> member, unlike most Albany <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city fathers</a>, 
            this <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a>-background native son did not play a major role in its operations.</p>

          <p>On the death of his father, Hendrick inherited substantial properties 
            and was heir to numerous opportunities as well. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1693">1693</a>, he was elected 
            to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> as assistant 
            alderman for the third ward. Two years later, he was elected alderman. 
            Hansen served until <a href="../../org/cc.html#1698">1698</a> when he was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
            of Albany by the royal governor. After a year, he was succeeded by 
            <a href="../vb/pvbrugh.html">Pieter Van Brugh</a>. But Hansen maintained 
            a close connection to the Albany government as a contractor and advisor. 
            That connection was formalized in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1703">1703</a> when he again was elected third 
            ward alderman. Hendrick Hansen held that position for much of the 
            remainder of his life. Throughout his municipal career, he was among 
            the most active participants in city business. His major responsibilities 
            included dealing with the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> 
            - for which he was a supplier, community infrastructure issues, <a href="../../cia.html">Indian 
            diplomacy</a>, and Albany's <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">lands</a> 
            beyond the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a>.</P>

<p>Unlike most of his contemporaries, his officeholding transcended the local level. While continuing to hold municipal offices, in 1699 he was elected to represent Albany in the <a href="../../org/ass.html">provincial legislature</a>. At the time of his death, he was serving a fifth term in the New York General Assembly.

<p>Hendrick Hansen filed a <a href="../../wills/willhehansen4939.html">will</a> in September 1723. He called himself an "Albany yeoman" and stated that he was "weak in body." It parceled out his substantial real estate in Albany, Schenectady, Fort Hunter, and beyond to his wife and children. He died in February 1724 and was buried beneath the Albany Dutch church.</P>
