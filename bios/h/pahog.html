<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Paul Hogstrasser</strong></a> was the son of German emigre <a href="pahog8494.html">Paul Hogstrasser</a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Hoch</a>straser). Perhaps he was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in October 1765. A same-named contemporary <a href="http://www.albanyhilltowns.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=Hochstrasser,_Paul_I.">lived</a> in the western part of Albany County.

<p>His wife was Catharina Snyder. Between 1800 and 1808, three children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He is <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/genealogygillso00jillgoog/genealogygillso00jillgoog_djvu.txt">said</a> to have had a second marriage.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued very substantially under the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> residence of <a href="../s/wmsnyder.html">William Snyder</a> (perhaps his father-in-law). In <a href="../../census1800.html#8495">1800</a> and afterwards, his Market  Street home was configued on the Albany census.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=%22paul+hochstrasser%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22paul%20+hochstrasser%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was listed in the first city directory as a merchant at 106 Market Street. His house on the corner of North Market and Maiden Lane was an early Albany <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">landmark</a>.  However, by 1820, the only address given for him in the directory was "Capitol" as he was identified as librarian and marshall. In 1827, he was identified as the literary librarian at the Albany Athenaeum. 

<p>We have not actively pursued his nineteenth century life but in April 1830, he resigned as Albany city clerk.
 
<p>According to an Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=%22paul+hochstraaer%22&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22paul%20hochstrasser%20&f=false">newspaper</a>, Paul Hogstrasser died of apoplexy at his residence in Perry, Genessee County in October 1834. His <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nycleroy/GeneseeCoWillTestatorsIndex/Genesee_Co_NY_Will_Testators_Index_E-K.htm">will</a> identified him as a resident of Perry.  He had lived seventy-one years. </p>
