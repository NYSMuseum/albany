<p> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry B. Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born 
        in October 1766. He was the first child born to the marriage of Albany 
        natives <a href="behallenbeck5249.html">Bernardus</a> and <a href="../c/coclark.html">Neeltie 
        Clark</a> Hallenbeck. He grew up in a large first ward family in a modest 
        home perhaps on <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5249">or</a> near 
        Court Street. 
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5281">1790</a>, the first Federal census 
        showed him alone in a first ward house. That would change after he married 
        nineteen-year-old <a href="../w/rawinne3105.html">Rachel Winne</a> at 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in July 1790. By 
        1806, seven children had been christened in Albany. The census of <a href="../../census1800.html#5281">1800</a> 
        showed the couple and four young children in their household located near 
        his widowed mother and other family homesteads. 
		
<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1796">1796</a>, he was identified as a member of a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> 
        company. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, he was identified 
        as a member of the "council" and as "Inspector of Weights and measures 
        and of bread." 
      <p>These Hallenbecks lived on family <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">property</a> 
        at what became 61 <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl</a> 
        Street in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1814</a>. By 1815, his name 
        was gone from the directory. 
      <p>Henry B. Hallenbeck was dead by February 1815 when his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> 
        passed probate.</p>
