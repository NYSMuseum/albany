<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dorothea Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born about 1771. She was the daughter of <a href="behallenbeck5249.html">Bernardus</a> and <a href="../c/coclark.html">Nelltie Clark</a> Hallenbeck. She grew up in a <a href="../../census1790.html#5249">mainline</a> family that controlled extensive land in what became the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of Albany..

<p>In September 1790, she married <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> newcomer <a href="../s/spstaff.html">Spencer Stafford</a>. Over the next decade-and-a-half, the marriage produced five children. However, only their last son was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where her family had been long-time members. Stafford was an <a href="../../stpeters.html">Ep</a>iscopalian.

<p>Stafford was a businessman who was able to build a home on <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#bottom">property</a> (along what became Madison Avenue) made available by the Hallenbecks. 

<p>However, Dorothea was not able to enjoy the elegant townhouse Stafford would erect in 1807. Following a brief illness, Dorothea Hallenbeck Stafford died in July 1806. She had lived only thirty-five years. Stafford re-married a year later and fathered more children.</p>
