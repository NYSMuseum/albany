<P><a href="#stcap"><img src="../../images/jpg/bldg/statecapschrodt.jpg" width=140 height=136 align=left vspace=1 hspace=4 alt="detail showing the first State Capitol from a 20th century diorama"></a><a href="#sources"><strong>Philip Hooker</strong></a> was Albany's first great architect. He designed many of the more outstanding buildings erected in post-<a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> Albany and across upstate New York. This sketch will place him in his Albany context.

 He was born in October 1766 and was the first son of <a href="sahooker.html">Samuel</a> and Rachel Hinds of Rutland, Massachusetts. Joining in the westward migration of aspiring <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankees</a>, his parents re-located to Albany prior to the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence.

<p>Samuel Hooker is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&pg=RA1-PA539&lpg=RA1-PA539&dq=%22samuel+hooker%22+albany&source=bl&ots=qaffFBBKth&sig=pRjLYE067BddCO6rARa5ser8SwU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qCJ3T9zKLMLA0AHRxJnDDQ&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20hooker%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have been a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a> and builder who was among those <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA302pg=PA302&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false">instructed</a> to appraise the building located at the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> in November 1787. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#saho">1790</a>, the nine-member <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household of Samuel and Rachel Hooker probably included their five sons and two daughters.

<p>Perhaps our subject was the Philip Hooker who was listed as a "house carpenter" in the New York City directories for 1792 and '93. Hooker <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=saO7aeaoUy4C&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=%22philip+hooker%22&source=bl&ots=MlRKl71jmE&sig=xcVhbS6nHISax07EhgeSUKo17PA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7p99T_msMYaY8gTPg-3xDA&ved=0CFIQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20hooker%22&f=false">probably</a> spent that decade learning from European architects and engineers who already were making an impact on the cityscapes of the new American nation. Hooker began to assemble a useful library and stayed behind in Albany when his parents and the rest of his family moved to Utica in 1797.

<p>As early as 1796, his name was included on a list of Albany <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a>men. Later, he served the city government in a number of <a href="../../corporation.html">offices</a> including those of alderman assessor, city architect, city superintendant, and city <a href="../../trades/sur.html">surveyor</a>. In each of those offices, over several decades, he made a major impact on the development and  transformation of the city of Albany.  

<p>By that time, Philip Hooker had associated himself with the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In June 1797, "Messrs. Hooker and <a href="../p/elputnam.html">Putnam</a>" were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=%22messrs.putnam+and+hooker%22&source=bl&ots=x7BXVPbLrm&sig=Q6YQyYQBCHZHsttxPL8LIPBkTR0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lZkOULSmBYeJ6AGLuIGYAQ&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22messrs.putnam%20and%20hooker%22&f=false">identified</a> as the "undertakers and architects" of the new church. He designed the new building that would be known as the "<a href="../../im/imepearlchurch.html">North Church</a>" on North Pearl Street.

<p>His New England-born first wife was named Mary. She died in 1812 at the age of thirty-nine. In January 1814, he married <a href="../m/samonk.html">Sara Monk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#orange">Orange Street</a> was assessed moderately. The <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> census in <a href="../../census1800.html#8523">1800</a> configured his home with three young men, two girls and Philip and his wife as residents. Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22hooker+philip%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hooker%20philip%22&f=false">1813</a>, this architect's residences were listed in the city directories and, over the next three decades, his holdings in various Albany locations were features of all community <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ss">surveys</a>.

<p>He was a prominent member of a number of Albany-based organizations including the <a href="../../ams.html#members">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In 1808, he was among those <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html">invited</a> to the notable funeral of Henry J. Bleecker.

<p>As Albany's <a href="#work">pre-eminent</a> architect, Hooker's designs included the first <a href="../../loc/stcap.html">State Capitol</a>, a number of Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a> and banks, the <a href="sahill8464.html">residence</a> now known as the Fort Orange Club, the <a href="../../loc/publicsq.html">A</a>lbany Academy, the Albany <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">city hall</a> of 1832, and many others in Albany and beyond. He also was a cartographer/surveyor and artist/illustrator who produced an often reproduced watercolor of <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a> in 1818.
 
<p>Philip Hooker resigned as city surveyor in 1832. He died in January 1836 at the age of sixty-nine. He was buried "in full hope of a blessed eternity" in the Episcopal church plot. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in February 1837. His often-photographed (and visited) <a href="http://albanyruralcemetery.blogspot.com/2011/08/philip-hooker-architect.html">gravestone</a> now resides in the "old" section of Albany Rural Cemetery. </p>

<p>This brief presentation is essentially biographical and, as such, cannot do justice to the body of Hooker's overall work. A convenient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Hooker">summary listing</a> of his creations appears in his Wikipedia article.

This particular offering appears here because it strikes me as "odd and delightful."
