<P><a href="#sources"><b>Bernardus Harsen</b></a> was born in January 1714. He was baptized in the New York City Dutch church.</p>

<p>In November 1730, he was sixteen and serving as a blacksmith in the Seneca country. Later, he would perform "smith's work" for Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>. 

<p>In February 1737, he married <a href="../p/capruyn.html">Catharina Pruyn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1754, four children had been christened at the Albany church where he was an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>During the 1740s and 50s, Bernardus Harsen was an Albany mainstay. His name was found on Albany freeholders <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">lists</a>. In 1743, he was one of those engaged to manage the city's <a href="../../fire.html#engine">fire engine</a>. He was appointed firemaster in 1755. A year later, he was identified as a "gunsmith" and householder on a <a href="../../census1756.html#125">census</a> taken by the British army. The last reference to him was dated <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#8347">1763</a>. A few years later, his wife and son were identified as householders on the assessment roll of 1767.</p>
