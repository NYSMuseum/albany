          <P><a href="#sources"><B>Henry Holland</B></a> was born at Omskirk in 
            Lancashire, England in 1661. He was the son of Thomas Holland and 
            Margaret Hitchen. During the 1690s he was an English soldier stationed 
            in Ireland. There, he met and married young widow <a href="../s/jseeley.html">Jenny 
            Seeley</a> Edwards of Bandon, County Cork. By 1699, the couple had 
            crossed the Atlantic to New York where Henry had been commissioned 
            an officer of the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison company</a> 
            stationed at Albany.</P>


          <p>From a rented house on <a href="../../loc/court.html">Court Street</a>, Holland 
            became a leader of the Albany garrison - earning extra income supplying 
            the fort with candles, firewood, and other supplies. Settling in Albany, 
            the Hollands began to raise a family that included several sons and 
            daughters. By 1709, he was the owner of the Court Street property 
            and had become an Albany mainstay as well. His children were baptized 
            in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and he later 
            became a member and warden of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> 
            Anglican church.</p>

<p>Henry Holland's military career spanned more than three decades. He was a  lieutenant, captain, and then commander of the Albany fort. As early as 1701, he was attending Albany court sessions - serving as <a href="#liaison">liaison</a> between the fort and the people of colonial Albany. His sons also served under their father in the garrison companies.</p> 

<p>As garrison commander, Holland was a member and often attended the meetings of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. In 1706 he was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html"sheriff>sheriff</a> of Albany. He held that post until 1712 and served again as sheriff in 1720. Well-regarded by royal officials in New York, he also held the office of  "Searcher of the Customs" for the entire Hudson Valley.</p>

<p>Henry Holland's various appointments and offices provided a substantial income enabling him to participate in <a href="#land">land patents</a>, invest in slaves, and build an impressive new home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. His sons utilized their father's status to establish themselves in Albany, New York, and on the frontier. <a href="../../bios/h/edholland.html">Edward Holland</a> became a particularly prominent Albany personage.</p>

<P>While still in command at the Albany fort, in 1732 he was stricken, became incapacitated and was replaced as garrison commander. His health declined further and he died in Albany in May 1736. His widow later moved to New York to live with their son, Edward. Henry, another son,      was appointed sheriff of Albany in 1739. The landmark Albany home later was sold to <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a>.</P>
