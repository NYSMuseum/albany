<strong>Ryckert Hansen</strong></a> was born in August 1703. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="hehansen4939.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vd/dvdam6351.html">Deborah Van Dam</a> Hansen. Both his father and <a href="hanshansen4954.html">brother</a> had been mayors of Albany. Sometimes, Ryckert Hansen was referred to in the record as "Richard" or as "Dirck."  

<p>In 1723, he was left a "convenient apartment" in the house of Abraham Schuyler in the <a href="../../wills/willhehansen4939.html">will</a> of his father. Otherwise, he did not share in his father's substantial estate.

<p>In May 1727, he married Sara Thong in New York City. She died in 1733 after bearing three children. In July 1738, he wed Albany native <a href="../t/catbroeck14.html">Catharina Ten Broeck</a> - who was fifteen years younger. By 1754, nine more of his children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and pewholders.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1728">1728</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>, he was first elected alderman. He was re-elected for the next four years and then appears to have retired from civic service.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders living in the third ward. In 1756, the British army identified the house of <a href="../../census1756.html#71">Richard Hansen</a> on a census of Albany householders.

<p>In 1766 and 1767, the minimal holdings of Derrick and Ryckert Hansen were valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">tax lists</a>. We are uncertain if they were the holdings of this individual.  

<p>Ryckert Hansen may have been dead by 1766 when his church pew was transferred to his nephew, <a href="../b/jojabeekman3866.html">Johannes J. Beekman</a>. In 1770, his widow was given a share of the city license to operate the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> across the Hudson.</p>
