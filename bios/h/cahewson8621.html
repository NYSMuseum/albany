<strong>Casparus Hewson</strong></a> was born in July 1758. He was the son of <a href="johewson2329.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../c/anco8616.html">Anna</a> Hewson. He grew up in a small family in a cordwainer's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 

<p>In 1777, he was identified as one of two sons in the <a href="../../wills/willjohewson.html">will</a> filed by his father. John Hewson was dead by 1779 when Casparus was considered on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">tax list</a> under the household of his mother. By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8621">1788</a>, the first ward assessment showed his property valued separately. Two years later, however, he probably was <a href="../../census1790.html#ah">included</a> on the census under the household of his mother.

<p>Within a few years, he had moved his family into their own <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">home</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. Later he re-located farther west on <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a>. His holdings there may have been shown on a developer's <a href="../../im/im1794.html">map</a> of the city above where Lion intersected with Dove Street. Casparus was known as a house and job painter and was active in the formation and early years of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. In 1797, he was elected first vice-president and was a trustee of the organization.

<p>He was an officer in the State militia. In September 1788, he was one of the assistants in the Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA373&lpg=PA373&dq=%22casparus+hewson%22&source=web&ots=GvPcofpYah&sig=ihi-jdS5Muuuxxye-k2mLO1DKcQ">ratification parade</a>. 

<p>His wife's name was Susanna Nicolls. Two of their children were christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church in 1787 and 1789. Casparus or his namesake was confirmed in St. Peter's in September 1791. His family had been active in St. Peter's for many years.

<p>He also belonged to the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> Lodge. In February 1789, a Masonic <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/newleb/masonic.htm">meeting</a> was held at his Albany house.

 <P>Casparus Hewson lost his wife in February 1795. He died in January 1813 at the age of fifty-three.</p>
