<P>According <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rclarke/page1/hutton2.htm">to</a> family-based material, <a href="#sources"> <strong>George Hutton</strong></a> was born in February 1730. He was the son of John and Elizabeth Van Dyck Hutton of New York City.

<p>A George Hutton (the father of silversmith <a href="ishutton.html">Isaac</a>) lived in Albany over several decades and died locally in 1806. We are not at all <a href="../qqqq.html">certain</a> that all of the following information relates to the life of a single individual.

<p>In February 1761, a George Hutton was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=%22hutton%22&source=web&ots=W4zL6h-NDG&sig=jgYAaGL-vhXYjpAzBa2ydE2OjSg#v=onepage&q&f=false">registered</a> as a freeholder in New York City. At that time, he was identified as a laborer.

<p>In April 1764, he married Anna Marie Viele in New York. The marriage produced at least two sons who became Albany residents. His children (also a daughter) were christened in New York.

<p>In January 1777, George Hutton of New York <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA312&lpg=PA312&dq=%22hutton,+george%22+artillery&source=bl&ots=vkPEFncwA7&sig=hhTSKrge_hiKaRHmMuTqaObDwAU&hl=en&ei=66VSTofHCoju0gG_0qS1Bw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22hutton%2C%20george%22%20artillery&f=false">was</a> a second lieutenant in the Second Continental Artillery. He resigned his commission in the artillery in May 1779. By that time, he temporarily had re-located his family to Albany. In late 1776 and afterwards, George and Mary witnessed <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/CLUTE/2004-08/1092576023">baptisms</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In October <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, his houses were taxed on the Albany assessment roll. They were not accounted for on the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">March</a> tax list.

<p>Perhaps afterward, a George Hutton was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=3Et5AAAAMAAJ&q=George+Hutton&source=gbs_word_cloud_r&cad=6">paid</a> for caring for horses and stables at Albany.

<p>After the war, these Huttons returned to New York where they were counted on the census in 1790.

<p>By the 1790s, perhaps this George Hutton was the <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/103029.htm">businessman</a> in partnership with his son <a href="ishutton.html">Isaac</a>, who became a prominent silversmith. Or <a href="../qqqq.html">perhaps</a> that individual was his son George (born 1773) who was Isaac's partner at least by the 1800s.

<p>In 1796, the Huttons <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/103029.htm">advertized</a> in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> for "Three Silver Smiths, May have constant employ in a very convienent shop, and recieve prompt pay, by application immediately to I. & G. HUTTON, No 32, Market Street."


<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#gehu">1800</a>, his third ward home included five young males and two slaves besides the aging Huttons.

<p>George Hutton <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA10&lpg=PA10&dq=%22george+hutton+died,+aged+77%22&source=bl&ots=2iIuHYWw7B&sig=-r8fmz4QcUTLTxgOXbHlxIyXlhE&hl=en&ei=GK5STqrsAaL00gHDx8HkBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22george%20hutton%20died%2C%20aged%2077%22&f=false">died</a> in April 1806. He had lived seventy-seven years. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=%22hutton&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hutton&f=false">1813</a>, the home of his sons was/were listed in the directory on lower Columbia Street and their store on Court Street.</p>
