      <P><a href="#sources"><b>William Hogan</b></a> was born about 1716. He was 
        the son of Albany mainstays <a href="juhogan4372.html">Jurrian</a> and 
        <a href="../b/mabeekman3874.html">Maria Beekman</a> Hogan. He was often 
        referred to as William Hogan, "the younger" to prevent confusion with 
        his <a href="wmhogan4396.html">grandfather</a> and <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan.html">benefactor</a> 
        who died in 1739 and with his uncle, <a href="wmhogan4397.html">William 
        Hogan, Jr.</a> 
      <p>In January 1740, he married <a href="../l/sulansing3682.html">Susanna 
        Lansing</a> at the Albany Dutch church where their eight children were 
        baptized and where they were frequent baptism sponsors - the last one 
        coming in February 1778. 
      <p>In 1740, he was permitted to build a small shed opposite his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> home. Two years later, his name appeared on a <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">list</a> 
        of qualified voters. For several decades that followed, he was an Albany 
        <a href="../../census1756.html#231">blacksmith</a> who received compensation 
        from the city for work done. During the 1760s, he also paid taxes on a 
        lot in the West Manor. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4398">1763</a>, 
        his again name was included on a list of Albany freeholders. 
      <p>In 1764, he was identified as the eldest son and co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willjuhogan.html">will</a> 
        filed jointly by his parents. 
      <p>William Hogan signed a petition in Albany in 1779. Into his sixties during 
        the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> years, his name appears to be 
        absent from Revolutionary rolls!</p>
      <p>In May 1787, William Hogan filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan4398.html">will</a> 
        stating that he was a resident of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        and had three living sons and two daughters. A wife was not named. The 
        will passed probate in September 1791!</p>
