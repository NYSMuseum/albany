<strong>Ann Margarita Helms</strong></a> was said to have been born about 1749. In 1767, her marriage bond noted that she was a spinster and of New York City. Her intended partner was a newly admitted attorney. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on her family and background.

<p>She was the wife of Albany attorney and operative <a href="../y/pwyates.html">Peter W. Yates</a>. Between 1768 and 1786, eight children were christened in Albany - although only half of them were baptized at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1771, they were <a href="../../coerec1771.html#pwy">members</a> of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.

<p>In March 1768, she joined her husband in witnessing the <a href="../../wills/willwmwaldron.html">will</a> of his grandfather.

<p>These Yateses lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> - finally in the <a href="../../loc/yatesmansion.html">grand mansion</a> built by Yates during the 1780s. Peter W. Yates was a prominent attorney and community leader who later served in the Contintental Congress and in the New York State legislature.

<p>Ann Margarita Helms Yates died in November 1794 at the age of forty-five. She was buried in the Dutch church cemetery. Yates re-married in 1798. After a time, he moved west - dying in Montgomery County in 1826.</p>
