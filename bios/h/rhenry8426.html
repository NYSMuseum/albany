<strong>Robert Henry, Jr.</strong></a> was born about 1750. He was not the son of Albany mainstays <a href="rhenry8425.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../v/elvernor8411.html">Elizabeth Vernor</a> Henry - although he most likely was a kinsman. He was known fairly consistently as "Robert Henry, Jr."

<p>We are unsure of his origins but he was in New York by May 1773 when "Robert Henry, Jr." witnessed a petition for the issuance of administrative bonds. 

<p>His name appeared on a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8426">list</a> of those eligible for land bounty rights in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>This individual does not appear to have married.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8426">1779</a>, his name was found on Albany assessment rolls with personal property valued substantially but under the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house of Robert Henry. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8426">1788</a>, his first ward house and property next to the holdings of Robert Henry appeared on the Albany assessment. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8425">1790</a>, he appears to have been counted on the census under the household of Robert Henry.

<p>Robert Henry, Jr. had passed on by August 1, 1792 when letters of administration were issued on his estate to administrator <a href="rhenry8427.html">Robert R. Henry</a>. Robert Jr's. estate included no real property but the subsequent <a href="../../wills/willrhenry8426.html">inventory</a> made in January 1793 showed three trunks of clothing, a violin, and a large collection of books then in the hands of a number of relatives. Book debts totalled almost five thousand pounds.

<p>From the sketchy information encountered <a href="../../cbr.html">so far</a>, this business-oriented bachelor, was at least self-educated and perhaps some sort of teacher as well.</p>
