<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Hun</b></a> was born in October 1695. He was the eldest son of Albany residents <a href="thhun4778.html">Thomas</a> and <a href="../o/mayoo686.html">Maycke Oothout</a> Hun. His father died in 1716 when Johannes was just reaching adulthood.</p>


      <p>He was almost thirty in May 1725 when he married a slightly older <a href="../w/anwinne2815.html">Anna 
        Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1736, their six children had been baptized there.</p>

<p>These Huns set up their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Johannes already had qualified as a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4776">freeholder</a>. He served as a constable in 1722 and, with his <a href="dihun4774.html">brother</a>, was a contractor of the city governmemnt. He was a third ward <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">mainstay</a> for many years.

<p>In 1741, he was named a partner in the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga Patent</a>.
 
<p>Anna Winne Hun died in 1759. "Weak in body," Johannes Hun filed a <a href="../../wills/willjohun.html">will</a> in 1764. It left a substantial estate including external real property to his children. He died in January 1776.</p>
