      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Hill</strong></a> was born about 
        1767. He was one of a <a href="http://www.stanglpottery.org/">nu</a>mb<a href="http://www.markwaldron.us/p34.htm#i838">er</a> 
        of relatively prominent, same-named American contemporaries. We seek to 
        understand his origins and path to Albany. 
      <p>This Samuel Hill was a merchant and businessman and probably settled 
        in Albany during the 1780s. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8464">1788</a>, 
        his personal property was assessed within another first ward household. 
        In December 1789, the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> reported 
        that he was selling dry goods and groceries on the west side of Market 
        Street, south of the <a href="../../loc/markethouse.html">Market House</a>. 
      <p>In January 1790, he married Mary Barry at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Episcopal church. The marriage produced a number of children. 
        In 1805, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA688&lpg=PA688&dq=%22samuel+hill%22+albany&source=bl&ots=GwJeufp-6l&sig=k--3OtsfyfuxRaTINpspd_BQdaY&hl=en&ei=a26pSczXBZCMnge95azaDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA399-IA1,M1">identified</a> 
        as the "treasurer of the [St. Peter's] building fund." 
      <p>Recently married to <a href="../b/thbarry1821.html">Thomas Barry</a>'s 
        daughter, he probably was accounted for under Barry's first ward household 
        on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#1821">1790</a>. 
      <p>In 1797, he <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections">took 
        title</a> to the land at 39-43 State Street. This address was the first 
        home of the <i><a href="#ahic">A</a>lbany Hardware and Iron Company</i> 
        at what Hill called "The sign of the Golden Hinge." 
      <p>The first ward census for <a href="../../census1800.html#8464">1800</a>, 
        showed his household (listed next to that of his father-in-law) with four 
        children under ten and two older boys as well. By that time, his name 
        was a fixture on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">ass</a>essments, 
        jury lists, and other community-based <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#8464">lists</a>. 
        He also was a trustee of the Albany library and, by 1813, a director of 
        the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>. 
      <p>On July 1, 1810, the Fort Orange Club first opened at the new <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA688&lpg=PA688&dq=%22samuel+hill%22+albany&source=bl&ots=GwJeufp-6l&sig=k--3OtsfyfuxRaTINpspd_BQdaY&hl=en&ei=a26pSczXBZCMnge95azaDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result">mansion</a> 
        designed by <a href="phhooker.html">Philip Hooker</a> and built for Samuel 
        Hill at what is now 110 Washington Avenue. 
      <p>He became a widower when Mary died in January 1816 at the age of forty-four. 
        Samuel Hill continued to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22hill%22editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA70,M1">reside</a> 
        at 39 State Street until he died in May 1819 and also was buried in the 
        Episcopal plot. He had lived fifty-two years. </p>
