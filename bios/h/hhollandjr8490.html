<P><A href="#sources"><B>Henry Holland, Jr.</B></A> was born in Albany in 
        1704. He was the second son of garrison officer and sheriff, <a href="hholland8489.html">Henry 
        Holland</a> and Irish-born <a href="../s/jseeley.html">Jenny Seeley</a> who had emigrated to New York and settled in Albany a few years earlier. 
        Both his father and older <a href="edholland.html">brother</a> would become 
        community leaders.</P>
      <P>By the time he was five, he was accompanying his soldier father. In 1709, 
        he was identified on a duty roster as a "boy" and "unfit for the Canadian 
        expedition." He continued to serve in his father's company until 1719, 
        when he was apprenticed for seven years to learn business in New York 
        under merchant Thomas Kearney.</P>
      <p>At the end of that term, he returned to Albany to tend to some of the 
        administrative aspects of his father's operations. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1727">1727</a>, 
        he was elected assistant alderman for the first ward. A year later, he 
        married <a href="../b/albeekman3878.html">Alida Beekman</a> - daughter 
        of a successful Albany merchant. The marriage produced but one daughter. 
        Settling in Albany, he purchased an additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lot</a> 
        on "the Plain" in 1730. Later, he would erect a substantial house on a 
        riverside location along <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>Over the next <a href="../../peace.html">two decades</a>, Henry Holland, 
        Jr. <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3">lived</a> in Albany but acted 
        to solidify his image as a loyal adherent among provincial authorities 
        in New York. He was rewarded with royal appointments as justice of the 
        peace, master of the chancery court, and <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> 
        of Albany County in 1739. He held that post through some local controversy 
        until 1746. By that time, Albany leaders openly resented the appointment 
        of royal placemen to the sheriff's office. Native son but clearly British-identified, 
        Henry Holland Jr. was a compromise appointee. He also was able to participate 
        in frontier land patents - an initiative that left him with valuable acreage 
        in the Mohawk country, at <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga</a>, 
        and to the north of Albany as well. During that period, he began to conduit 
        cargoes out to frontier developer <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>.</p>
      <p>During the hostilities with the French in 1744-48, Holland served as 
        a commissary - procuring provisions and supplies on behalf of the British 
        war effort. Still the sheriff, he came under fire in Albany for his tactics 
        in securing materials from Albany storehouses. He was replaced as sheriff 
        in September 1746.</p>
      <p>In 1756, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willedholland.html">will</a> 
        of his brother. By that time, Henry Holland, Jr. had relocated to New 
        York City to pursue business opportunities. During the <a href="../../7yw.html">Great 
        War for Empire</a>, he was an owner of at least two privateers. He also 
        acquired an estate on Staten Island and represented Richmond County in 
        the provincial Assembly from 1761 to 1769.</p>
      <p>In March 1777, he filed a will calling himself a New York merchant and 
        in good health. No wife nor children were named. His executors were instructed 
        to sell his real estate for the education of his grandchildren. His slave 
        Dinnah, was to be freed within a year of his death. And the remainder 
        of his estate was to be divided among his three living grandchildren. 
        The will cleared probate in May 1782.</p>
