<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nathan Hawley</strong></a> is <a href="#source">said</a> to have been born in Redding, Connecticut in 1763 <a href="../../res/ts.html">or</a> 1765 and to have been the son of Samuel and Katherine Bennett Hawley. Same-named contemporaries complicate defining his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In April 1785, he married <a href="../s/elsears.html">Elizabeth Sears</a> of Danbury, Connecticut. By 1810, the marriage had <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=REG&db=eliassillhawley&id=I5734">produced</a> at least twelve children who were born in Connecticut, across New York, perhaps even in Kentucky as the Hawley's sought to set down permanent roots. Their last daughter arrived a month after Nathan's death.

<p>By the late 1780s, the couple had settled in the Heldeberghs town of Rensselaersville where Nathan worked as a farmer. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his household of five was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyalbany/census/1790Renscen.html">configured</a> on the Albany County census for Rensselaersville. About 1795, he became the town's first schoolmaster. 

<p>In 1800, the Hawleys relocated to Albany  where Nathan found employment as a <a href="../../loc/jail.html">jailer</a>. His family is said to have occupied rooms adjoining and in the rear of the new jail. His wife is said to have run a boarding house and inn <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA69&lpg=PA69&dq=%22hawley+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hawley%20widow%22&f=false">there</a> at 71 Maiden Lane.

<p>The Hawley family in their Albany home is the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ecDZkmBJmocC&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22nathan+hawley%22+albany&source=bl&ots=uzvO_fcOSd&sig=v1047iC6446YxoksgbOHjm8CYao&hl=en&ei=3T5lTaKNDYOB8gbM9aiJBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22nathan%20hawley%22%20albany&f=false">subject</a> of a classic American folk art <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ecDZkmBJmocC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22nathan+hawley%22+albany&source=bl&ots=uzvO_fcOSd&sig=v1047iC6446YxoksgbOHjm8CYao&hl=en&ei=3T5lTaKNDYOB8gbM9aiJBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22nathan%20hawley%22%20albany&f=false">watercolor</a>.
 
<p>Nathan Hawley is <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=52811012">said</a> to have died in February 1810. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in March. His widow continued on in Albany for at least five more years and survived until 1846.

<p>Although he was an Albany mainstay for the last decade of his life, the name of Nathan Hawley was found only infrequently in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based record</a> thus far encountered.</p>
