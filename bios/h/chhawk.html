<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Christopher Hawk</strong></a> probably was born after 1750. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>The name of Christopher Hawk appeared on the wartime roster of the seventh regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.
 
<p>A Christopher <a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>awk was a "constable" in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> and was involved in wartime <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GuH0Jp1290MC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=%22hawk+christopher%22&source=bl&ots=SkR-yClAbl&sig=ix9hATBc00rpq2ZNOge1atbLU1g&hl=en&ei=kvymTa-zNcKBtgfWxrWFAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22hawk%20christopher%22&f=false">activities</a> in that part of the county. His account for sixteen shillings appeared in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GuH0Jp1290MC&pg=PA812&lpg=PA812&dq=%22christopher+hawk%22+albany&source=bl&ots=SkR-yCkFek&sig=INbwDGEZliSz_m-K1mWByA5YfuU&hl=en&ei=u_qmTbbdKZLogQex-vjzBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&sqi=2&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22christopher%20hawk%22%20albany&f=false">records</a> of the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Comm</a>issioners. Perhaps a different Christopher Hawk was <a href="http://my.tbaytel.net/bmartin/aid.htm">named</a> on a roster of Royalist recruits.

<p>His wife was Mary <a href="../../res/sp.html">Pa</a>ssinger. Between 1796 and 1800, two of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#8370">1790</a>, his second ward household included eight people. However, his property does not appear to have been valued on city assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">rolls</a> for the period 1779-99.

<p>Christopher Hawke was dead by 1815 when his widow was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> with the address of "<a href="../../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor Hill</a>."

<p>At this point, in this skeletal <a href="../../res/bios.html#sketch">sketch</a> we have sought to make some <a href="../../res/guess.html">sense</a> of the life of a one-time Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">resident</a>. Following a broad sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based</a> resources, too many life <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> remain unresolved. Thus, we move on for now! </p>
