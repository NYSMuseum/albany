<P><a href="../../trades/silver.html">S</a>ilversmith <a href="#sources"> <strong>Joseph Hall</strong></a> was living in Albany during the War for Independence.  A number of same-named contemporaries living in the Northeast leave us with a number of unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.

<p>This individual is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/191613.htm">said</a> to have been born in Redding, Connecticut in 1746 and to have been the son of Joshua and Deborah Williams Hall.

<p>He was in Albany by <a href="../../coc.html">1775</a>, when he contributed eight shillings toward the relief of Ticonderoga. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8312">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. We seek more information on his activities during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary era.

<p>His wife was Johanna <a href="http://www.genealogy.stellarwinds.org/Family%20Originations/Patterson.htm">Patterson</a>. Between 1777 and 1781, three children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In October <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, his property was valued on an Albany assessment roll. From his placement on the tax list, it appears that he was living in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. During those years, he signed at lease one community-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#pet">petition</a> addressed to the governor. In May 1781, he was identified as a silversmith when he posted a hundred pounds bail with the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>.

 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">1781</a>, he was among the newcomers who purchased the Freedom of Albany.  At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a>. During the 1780s, he is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/214180.htm">said</a> to have been the mentor of New York City silversmith Drew Hall. These are among the obvious examples of Joseph Hall's craftsmanship:

<p>In 1785, a Joseph Hall settled on a <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/amasa-j-amasa-junius-parker/landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek/page-47-landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek.shtml">farm</a> in the what became Rensselaerville. A map made in 1787, showed his lot. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, four men named Joseph Hall were listed on the census in New York State. All were heads of households located in the southern part of the state. The one-time Albany silversmith was said to have been plying his trade in New York City.

<p>Joseph Hall is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~silversmiths/makers/silversmiths/191613.htm">said</a> to have died in Cambridge, New York in 1821.</p>
