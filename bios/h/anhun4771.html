<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Hun</b></a> was born in September 1763. She was the older of the two children of Market Street residents <a href="thjhun4781.html">Thomas</a> and <a href="../w/elwendell2860.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> Hun.</p>


<p>In May 1795, she married Rev. <a href="../b/jobassett.html">John Bassett</a>. Although then in her thirties, the marriage produced five children - some of whom who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where her Brooklyn-born husband was the interim pastor!</p>

<p>In 1800, she was named co-executor of her father's estate. In 1811, she was co-executor of the estate of her brother. Previously (1764), she was left 250 acres in Sacandaga in the <a href="../../wills/willjohun.html">will</a> of her grandfather, Johannes Hun.</p>

<p>These Bassetts lived in the parsonage on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. But in 1804, the family left Albany as Bassett's tenure at the Albany church was troubled. Over the next twenty years, they made stops at the Boght and in Bushwick, Long Island where he died in 1824. After that, Anna lived with her children.</p>


<p>Anna Hun Bassett died in Penn Yan, New York in October 1848. The widow had lived eighty-six years.</p>
