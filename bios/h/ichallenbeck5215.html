<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac Casperse</b></a> was born in 1660. He was the third son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers 
        <a href="cahallenbeck5214.html">Casper Jacobse</a> and Maria Hallenbeck. 
        He was <a href="../../res/sp.html">kn</a>own in Albany circles as "Isaac 
        Casperse."</p>

<p>By the 1680s, he had married New Amsterdam native <a href="../b/dobosch2037.html">Dorothy 
        Bosch</a>. They raised a family of at least seven children who would be 
        baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> as late 
        as 1706.</p>
		
<p>These Hallenbecks lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> of Albany where he also owned a large tract of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> that stretched from the stockade to the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a> and would <a href="../../loc/hallbg.html">remain</a> with his heirs for more than a  century. He was an <a href="../../census1697.html#020">Albany mainstay</a> whose 
        city holdings were assessed on a par with the more successful merchants. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5215">1699</a>, he joined his Albany 
        neighbors in signing a loyalty oath to the king of England. Almost a decade 
        later, his <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real</a> property still 
        was valued substantially (probably in reference to his extensive lands 
        on the Southside) on the city <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5215">assessment 
        roll</a>.</p>
		
      <p>Isaac Casperse Hallenbeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willichallenbeck.html">will</a> 
        in November 1708. It stated that he was of Albany city and his wife was 
        "of New York City." It named seven living children who would share his 
        property which included an island in the Hudson River above Albany, other 
        land, and personal property. He died in March 1709 and was buried from 
        the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>. Church records 
        said he was about forty-nine years old!</p>
