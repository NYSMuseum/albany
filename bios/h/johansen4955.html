<strong>Hans Hansen, Jr.</strong></a> was born on July 13, 1706 and christened the next day at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He was the son of <a href="johansen4940.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../d/sadf4714.html">Sara De Foreest</a> Hansen. This eldest son grew up as part of a large family in a modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Much of his life contour is chronicled in the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">family bible</a>. His brother "Johannes" was born in 1718. 
He often was called Hans Hansen, Jr." to prevent confusion with his older, more famous, same-named <a href="hanshansen4954.html">cousin</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1733">1733</a>, John Hansen, Jr. was appointed constable for the third ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#jh">1742</a>, the name of "Johannes Hansen" appeared on a list of freeholders for the third ward.

<p>In July 1740, Hans married Margarita Kip of New York at her father's house. They had two children before Margarita died in August 1745. She was buried in New York.  After that time, Hans no longer entered information in the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible20.htm">family bible</a>.

<p>In November 1746, Johannes Hansen was admitted to the freemanship of New York City and was identified as a gunsmith. Non native-born men were required to apply for the <a href="../../nat.html">freedom</a> of a city. 

<p>In July 1759, the account of Hans Hansen, Jr. for nine shillings was paid by the Albany city treasurer.

<p>We seek information on his later life and passing.</p>
