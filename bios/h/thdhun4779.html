<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas D. Hun</strong></a> was born in May 1736. He was the son of Albany natives <a href="dihun4774.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="mgthogan4374.html">Margarita Hogan</a> Hun. Known as Thomas D. Hun, he grew up in a moderate sized family in the first ward home of a <a href="../../census1756.html#265">prom</a>inent carpenter. We strive to not confuse Thomas D. with at least two other contemporary Thomas Huns who also were Albany residents.

<p>In November 1761, he married the somewhat younger <a href="../vd/bavdu5506.html">Bata (Barentje) Van Deusen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1773, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Huns first made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> from where Thomas D. followed his father into <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpentry</a>. During the 1760s, his name (Thomas Dirck Hun) appeared on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> in the third ward. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1767">1767</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the third ward. In 1788 and again in 1791, he was a member of a first ward engine company. In 1767, he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>Almost forty at the outbreak of hostilities, in 1775, he was <a href="../../coc.html">paid</a> for working on the barracks and for supplying firewood. Afterwards, Thomas D. Hun was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4779">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4779">1779</a>, the lot of Thomas D. Hun was valued on the first ward assessment along with a number of lots belonging to simply "Thomas Hun." In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4779">1788</a> and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward holdings were valued in the same general location.
 
<p>The census of <a href="../../census1790.html#4779">1790</a> noted five family members. A freeholders <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">list</a> from August 1797 still identified him as a carpenter. By <a href="../../census1800.html#4779">1800</a>, the aging parents and two others were counted in his household.

<p>Thomas D. Hun is said to have lived until 1802.</p>
