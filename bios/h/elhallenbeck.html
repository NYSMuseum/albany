<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born in the autumn of 1725 (christened on October 5). She was the daughter of <a href="hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/subradt4279.html">Susanna Bradt</a> Hallenbeck. She grew up in a very large family on the very large tract of <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> lands owned by her yeoman father.

<p>Elizabeth was the wife of Albany native <a href="wmholl8515.html">William Holling</a>. Perhaps she was married by April <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part3.html">1747</a> when "Elizabeth Hellen" witnessed a baptism with Hendrick Hallenbeck. Between 1749 and 1754, the couple christened four children in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their names honored those of their grandparents. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#186">1756</a>, the home of "William Holling" was inventoried by the British army.

<p>In 1766, she was among the children named in the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> filed by her father. At that time, she was identified as the wife of "William Helling." She was among the eight living children named as executors of his estate.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Elizabeth Hallenbeck Holling.</p>
