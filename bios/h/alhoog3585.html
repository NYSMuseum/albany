      <P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Alida Hooghkerk</strong></a> was born in March 
        1742. She was the daughter of Albany mainstays <a href="luhoog3604.html">Lucas</a> 
        and <a href="../f/refonda3840.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Hooghkerk. Her mother 
        died in 1750 leaving her as the sole <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/h/a/l/Jamie-L-Hald/GENE4-0003.html">surviving 
        daughter</a>. Her father (a <a href="../../census1756.html#168">prominent</a> 
        stoneman) lived a while longer but does not appear to have remarried.
      <p><a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a> family obligations accounted for her being thirty when, in December 1772, Alida married the younger Albany native known as <a href="../w/jowendell2977.html">John J. Wendell</a>. By 1781, the marriage had produced at least four children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>These Wendells appear to have begun to raise their family in a Hooghkerk <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2977">house</a> on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South Side</a> of Albany 

<p>However, their marriage was not long lasting as John J. Wendell is said to have been buried in April 1786.  The Albany assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wiwe">1788</a>, placed a modest assessment on the house and property of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Widow Wendell" located in the third ward. However, at least two additional "widow Wendells were at-risk in the city of Albany. 

<p>The census of <a href="../../census1790.html#3585">1790</a>, configured the first ward household of Alida Wendell with a boy and five unspecified females. A decade later, the first ward census listed the household of "John J. Wendell" in roughly the same location but with only an older woman (probably widow Alida) living with a younger couple (probably another John J. and wife) and three young children. 

<p>The first city directory in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22wendell+boardinghouse%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22wendell%20boardinghouse%22&f=false">1813</a>, listed the boarding house of "widow Wendell" at 22 Maiden Lane. One of three "widow Wendells" listed on that page, another entry noted the "widow of John" at 3 Union Street. 

<p>Alida Hooghkerk Wendell died in February of 1813. She had lived seventy-two years. A <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=88799944">monument</a> for the couple later was erected in <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.</p>
