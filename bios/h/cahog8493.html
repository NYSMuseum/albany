<strong>Catherine Hogstrasser</strong></a> was born about 1736. She most likely was the sister or other kin of Albany mainstay, German-ancestry emigre, <a href="pahog8494.html">Paul Hogstrasser</a>.

<p>In March 1765, she would have been approaching thirty when she married newcomer baker <a href="../r/joram1123.html">Johan Otto Rham</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1779, a number of their children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Rams were mainstays of Albany's German- ancestry community that emerged after the end of the <a href="../../7yw.html">colonial wars</a>. John was a notable baker who supported his family in their <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1123">mod</a>est <a href="../../census1790.html#1123">home</a> on lower Columbia Street in a marriage that lasted forty years. In <a href="../../census1800.html#1123">1800</a>, their household also included a young man and four girls in addition to the aging parents. 

<p>John Ram died in 1805. Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA85,M1">1813</a>, her home was listed in city directories at 31 <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia</a>. In 1820 and afterwards, she was identified as a "<a href="../../trades/cloth.html">m</a>antuamaker." 
Catherine Hogstrasser Ram died in February 1826. The newspaper obituary noted that she was ninety years old.</p>
