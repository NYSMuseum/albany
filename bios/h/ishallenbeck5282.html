<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born in April 1719. He was the first son born to the marriage of <a href="hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/subradt4279.html">Susanna Bradt</a> Hallenbeck. He grew up in a large family on a large parcel of family property located on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a>. 

<p> In December 1741, he married <a href="../vw/gervwoert2516.html">Gerritje Van Woert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In November 1764, he was acknowledged as the heir-at-law in the <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> 
        filed by his father. Thus, he was bequeathed ten shillings as his birthright. 
        In addition, he was scheduled to receive a one-eighth share of the estate 
        after the passing of Hendrick's widow. His father went on to specify that, 
        in the event that son Isaac "should not return" (implying he was away 
        but still alive at the time?), his three living sons were named to share 
        in their father's share.

<p>That was the last recorded reference to Isaac I. Hallenbeck. His name 
        has not been found in the relevant <a href="../../sources.html"uny">records</a> 
        so far encountered for greater Albany County. A hundred years later, Joel 
        Munsell <a href="hallenbeck.html#sources">noted</a> in a piece on the 
        family that "Isaac disappeared mysteriously and was never heard of." 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#5283">1800</a>, the household of a 
        much younger, but same-named individual was configured on the first ward 
        census. A <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">diagram</a> map of South 
        Pearl Street (dated to the early 1800s) shows the houselot property of 
        Isaac Hallenbeck between those of other family members in the block between 
        <a href="../../streets.html#hal">Plain</a> and Hamilton Streets.</p>
