<strong>Isaac Hansen</strong></a> was born in September 1714. He was the son of <a href="johansen4940.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../d/sadf4714.html">Sara De Foreest</a> Hansen. He was a middle child in a large Albany family. 

<p>In December 1742, he married <a href="../b/mabradt4266.html">Maria Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1757, at least eight children had been christened in Albany.

<p>Isaac was a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> who was named firemaster for the third ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1744">1744</a>. In  <a href="../../census1756.html#38">1756</a>, the census noted that his home (located next to that of his father-in-law) contained five rooms.

<p>In July 1754, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6222.html">will</a> of Luycas Wyngaert.

<p>Isaac Hansen died in March of 1758 and was buried from his church. He had lived only forty-three years. His widow survived for several decades longer and at least two of their sons became Albany residents.</p>
