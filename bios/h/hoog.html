<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hooghkerks</strong></a> were a mainline family of early Albany as a result of the two marriages of <a href="luhooghkerk3603.html">Lucas Luycasse</a> who settled in Albany about 1686. From at least ten children, only one son would head an Albany <a href="../../criteria.html">city</a> household. The origins and immigration history of the family has not been definitively fixed.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3603">1720</a>, only the name of the Albany pioneer (Luykas Hooghkirck) appeared on a list of freeholders in Albany County. The family grew slowly in the city - mostly with one household at a time.

<p>The winter of 1741 was particularly hard on the Albany Hooghkerks as old Luycas and two grandchildren were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ekzbsUVeXpIC&pg=PA463&lpg=PA463&dq=hooghkerk&source=bl&ots=gF2lpoKv5v&sig=MFOrQ4mcNAC96wditE-jI56cSM0&hl=en&ei=4UCOTPXDIYH_8AaG0amfCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBEQ6AEwADg8#v=onepage&q=hooghkerk&f=false">buried</a> in the church cemetery.

<p>By the 1740s, <a href="luhoog3604.html">Lucas Jr.</a> had followed his father in the brickyard and added a lime kiln as well. In 1756, he was identified as "<a href="../../census1756.html#168">Lucas Ockirk</a>."
		
<p>Tailor <a href="johooghkerk3600.html">John Hooghkerk</a> signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#3600">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty in 1766 and served in the Revolutionary army. Like most of his family, he lived on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany near what would become <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a> at or near the location of the first <a href="../../presbyterian.html">P</a>resbyterian meeting house.

Living Hoodhgkerk <a href="../m/mamartin8563.html">widows</a> appear to have been absorbed within other households. Statewide, the Albany households were the only family representatives listed.
  		
<p>In 1813, five "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22hooghkirk+garret%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hooghkirk%20garret%22&f=false">Hooghkirk</a>" households (including the Beaver Street addresses of two widows) were listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.

<p>The <a href="http://newyorkgravestones.org/view.php?id=31194">photo</a> on the right shows a stone <a href="../../dead.html">moved</a> from the Washington Park church plot to Albany Rural Cemetery after the Civil War. 
		
In 1830, three Hooghkerk-named households appeared in the city directory.

<p>The early Albany Hooghkerks maintained a small but steady <a href="../../familynames.html">presence</A> in the community from the late seventeenth century. Following the building trades and especially brickmaking, they were well represented in the community's production economy and owned modest homes mostly in the first ward.</p>
