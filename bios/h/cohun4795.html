<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelia Hun</b></a> was born in 1763. She was the daughter of Albany  residents <a href="wmhun4784.html">William</a> and <a href="../d/sadf4743.html">Sarah De Foreest</a> Hun. Her family was small - her only sibling being an older brother named <a href="dihun4796.html">Dirck</a>.</p>


<p>In October 1783, she married young businessman <a href="../f/jofondajr.html">John Fondey, Jr.</a>, a recently discharged officer in the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">army</a>. After living with her parents for more than a decade, these Fondeys took over her family home by 1800.</p>

<p>Her marriage produced at least six children who were captured in a beautiful <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/Painting/ames.htm">family portrait</a> done in 1803. During that time, she joined her husband in numerous real estate transactions. Perhaps these involved lands inherited from her family.</p>

<p>Cornelia Hun Fonda lost her husband in 1814. She <a href="../../wills/willjofondajr.html">inherited</a> the bulk of his estate and lived in their landmark Market Street home. The date of her passing remains unknown but her will passed probate in January 1828.</p>
