<strong>Jannetie Hun</strong></a> was born in June 1739. She was the daughter of <a href="hahun4773.html">Harmen</a> and <a href="../l/elslansing3324.html">Elsie Lansing</a> Hun. She grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of an Albany shoemaker. 

<p>In November 1762, she married <a href="../vv/vovvechten2574.html">Volkert Van Vechten</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. That marriage appears to have produced but two children - born in 1763 and 1768. In October 1792, she would have been in her fifties when she married <a href="../l/thlansing3687.html">Thomas Lansing</a>. However, Jannetje was a long time  pewholder and supporter of the church.

<p>With the death of her first husband (probably during the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2574">late</a> 1780s), Jannetje became <a href="../../census1790.html#4775">head</a> of their first ward household where she lived supported by four slaves. After her second marriage, she probably went to live in Thomas Lansing's house which was located nearby.

<p>These Lansings lived modestly on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany near other members of her family. In 1793, she was named an heir and co-executor of her father's estate.

<p>Jannetie Hun Van Vechten Lansing died in March 1807.</p>
