<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Heaton</b></a> was a painter known for a number of limner portraits of early Albany people. He was an Albany resident during the 1730s and 40s.</p>


<p>In June 1730, he married <a href="mahooghkerk3609.html">Maria Hooghkerk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. During the 1730s, their children were baptized in Albany and he witnessed a number of baptisms in the church as well. </p>

      <p>He painted portraits for the <a href="../w/abewendell2739.html">Wendells</a> 
        and other prominent regional families. His portrait entitled "<a href="../vr/boy.html">Boy 
        of the Van Rensselaer Family</a>" stands out as the only known likeness 
        of an eighteenth century <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro Albanian</a>. 
        He also painted the reknowned "<a href="http://www.hudsonvalley.org/crossroads/image/image33.html">Van 
        Bergen Overmantle</a>."</p>

<p>In 1731, he purchased lot number eight on "the Plain" from the city. Three years later, he still had not paid for the land. In November 1736, he was appointed firemaster in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. His name appeared on a freeholder list for the first ward of Albany in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>. 

<p>After 1742, however, his name dropped from Albany rolls. <a href="#perhaps">Perhaps</a> they were the John "Eton" and Marytie Hoogkerck (from Albany) who were mentioned in Reformed church records in Bergen County, New Jersey in 1749 and during the 1750s. Their daughter, Mary Van Buskirk, lived in Bergen County as well.</p>
