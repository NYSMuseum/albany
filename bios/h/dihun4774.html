<P><a href="#sources"><b>Dirck Hun</b></a> was born in September 1704. He was the third son of Albany residents <a href="thhun4778.html">Thomas Harmanse</a> and <a href="../o/mayoo686.html">Mayke Oothout</a> Hun. This son of a prominent merchant lost his father in 1716.


<p>About 1725, he married the slightly older innkeeper's daughter <a href="mgthogan4374.html">Margarita Hogan</a>. By 1741, five of their children had been baptized in the Albany Dutch church. However, this Albany native was a member of his wife's church, <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a>.</p>

<p>Dirck Hun earned his living as a <a href="../../makers.html#wood">carpenter</a>. By the 1740s, his sons had joined him as joiners. His first ward home and shop were well-known Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#265">landmarks</a>.</p>

<p>Although he held no municipal offices, he performed contract work for the city government and was <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#4774">qualified</a> to vote. Besides his sons, his enterprises were supported by slave labor.</p> 

<p>His name last appeared on city rolls in 1779 - although he may have been <a href="mgthogan4374.html">dead</a> by that time. Too old for actual service during the war, during the 1780s he was awarded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany County militia.</a></p>

<p>His widow was identified as a head of household in 
<a href="../../census1790.html#4374">1790</a>.</p>
