<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Mary Hogan</strong></a> was born in July 1740. She was the first child born to the marriage of Albany natives <a href="wmhogan4398.html">William</a> and <a href="../l/sulansing3682.html">Susanna Lansing</a> Hogan. She grew up in the large family of a first ward blacksmith who also had a place in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>.

<p>In February 1762, she received a licence to marry newcomer butcher <a href="../c/wmcharles7590.html">William Charles</a>. The marriage produced at least one surviving <a href="../c/geocharles7588.html">son</a>. William Charles was an <a href="../../stpeters.html">Anglican</a> while Mary was a pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. During the 1790s, "Mary Charles" was witnessing Hogan family baptisms at the Dutch church.

<p>This Charles family made their home in Albany's <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> where William was a prominent <a href="../../trades/meat.html">butcher</a> who had additional people living in their home.
 
<p>William Charles appears to have died during the 1780s as his widow was listed as the householder on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1118">1788</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1118">1790</a>, her home was configued on the Albany census and included her young adult <a href="../c/geocharles7588.html">son</a>.

<p>In March 1787, she was named as an heir and co-executor of the estate in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> filed by her father. Her mother was dead by that time. She also was co-executor of her husband's <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html">estate</a> in 1793.

<p>"Mericha Charles" was alone in her modest first ward home in <a href="../../census1800.html#1118">1800</a>.

<p>The "Widow Charles" died in July 1808 and was buried from her church. In June 1813, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on her estate.</p>
