<a href="#sources">
<strong>Jannetie Heyer</strong></a> probably was born during the 1760s. Then she would have been the daughter of Albany residents <a href="geheyer8443.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../vs/javslyck1679.html">Jannetie Van Slyck</a> Heyer.

<p>Her husband was Albany native <a href="../l/jalansing3734.html">Jacob Jo. Lansing</a> - who was born in 1753. <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ga4/myhayes_family/f_2ca.html#4">Perhaps</a> they were married about 1783 in what became Rockland County where his family had kinfolk. Between 1784 and 1793, three children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>These Lansings probably were Albany residents. However, their life together was cut short by the death of Jacob Jo. Lansing after a short illness following the birth of their last child. He died in June 1794 at the age of forty.

<p>After that, we have been unable to locate her in the community-based resources so far consulted. We seek information on the later life and passing of Jannetie Heyer Lansing.
