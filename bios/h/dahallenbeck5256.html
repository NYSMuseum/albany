<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Daniel Hallenbeck</strong></a> was born in December 1727. He was the second son of <a href="hehallenbeck5274.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../b/subradt4279.html">Susanna</a> Bradt Hallenbeck. He grew up in the very large family of a first ward yeoman who owned extensive real property just beyond the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">south side</a> of settled early Albany. Daniel probably was <a href="#name">named</a> for his maternal <a href="../b/dabradt4340.html">grandfather</a>.

<p>In November <a href="../../org/cc.html#1757">1757</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. However, a month later he was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22whereas+daniel+halenbeek%22&source=bl&ots=wyhCaUwdnA&sig=pCiHuUnzu_spqReb0EKZfF_f_hA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIpY7Q4cW_xwIVg6w-Ch2NWAY4#v=onepage&q=%22whereas%20daniel%20halenbeek%22&f=false">removed</a> from that post as he was "out of town." 

<P>This Albany native appears to have <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA130&lpg=PA130&dq=%22halenbeck,+daniel,+m.%22&source=bl&ots=-_v4B1KS9r&sig=v40Grm8UycrhlRlOlo1R2O4weWU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMIjO3NhNO_xwIVQxY-Ch1pXwmD#v=onepage&q=%22halenbeck%2C%20daniel%2C%20m.%22&f=false">married</a> twice. By the early 1750s, Daniel had married Albany native <a href="hehilton.html">Hendrickie Hilton</a>. After bearing two children, she was buried from the Albany church in September 1755. In April 1759, he posted a "marriage bond" to wed Catharina Quackenbush. At that time, he was identified as a merchant of Albany city. Through two marriages he was the father of at least nine children - most of whom were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between about 1750 and 1765.

<P>In March 1762, "Daniel Hallenbeck of Albany" was among those receiving a <a href="http://history.rays-place.com/ny/ren-hoosick-ny.htm">patent</a> for 10,000 acres located north of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ma</a>nor and east of <a href="../../na/hoos.html">Ho</a>osick.

<p>In 1764 he was <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">named</a> among the eight living direct heirs destined to share in the large Albany estate of his father following the death of their mother. His mother lived until 1787.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5256">1779</a>, the real property of Daniel and also of a "Daniel Jr." (located within the Hallenbeck family holdings in Albany) was valued on the first ward assessment roll 

<p>Perhaps (or not) he was the Daniel Halenbeck whose <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a> holdings were <a href="../../sources.html#uny">taxed</a> modestly in 1766. However, additional same named individuals are at-risk for eastern Albany County during that time.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=H6pCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=maple+town+halenbeck&source=bl&ots=SQ-WDs6V8C&sig=d-WOlDmS0a5zbUAwyKSjaeE0-sY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwBWoVChMI3KWFhNm_xwIVC3s-Ch33yw3G#v=onepage&q=maple%20town%20halenbeck&f=false">July 1778</a>, "Daniel Halenbeck" was among those residents of "Maple Town" who were to be called by the Albany Commissioners to testify against Tory Simon Fraser.
  
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of a Daniel Hallenbeck was configured on the <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHKP-G24">census</a> for Hoosick and included three males over 16, four boys under 16, and five females.

<p>At this point, we cannot connect or rule out the possibilities of connecting the Daniel Hallenbecks at risk in greater Albany County. Exercising caution in the assignment of qualitative  information, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
