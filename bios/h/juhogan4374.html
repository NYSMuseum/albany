<P>With both names <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled <a href="hogan.html#var">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jurrian Hogan</strong></a> was born in August 1745. He was first the son christened to the marriage of Albany natives <a href="wmhogan4398.html">William Hogan</a>, <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part3.html">Jr.</a> (aka "the younger") and <a href="../l/sulansing3682.html">Susanna Lansing</a> Hogan. He grew up in a large family in the modest home of a third ward blacksmith.

<p>In May <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#4374">1767</a>, his name appeared with the enlisted men on a roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In September <a href="https://archive.org/stream/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1/MinutesOfTheAlbanyCommitteeOfCorrespondence1775-1778Vol1_djvu.txt">1776</a>, the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> learned that one "George Hogan" had been elected ensign in a Rensselaerswyck militia company. In April <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=j6k2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=%22george+hogan%22+white+albany&source=bl&ots=P7MnI3wxjb&sig=GbWkhRBUiliRWsJwR9CvZNgmEaU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjP8YDP7I_KAhXE4SYKHd_BDucQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&q=%22george%20hogan%22%20white%20albany&f=fal">1778</a>, Hogan was commissioned captain in the Fifth Regiment (Rensselaerswyck) of the of Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>.

<p>In November 1778, "John Hoogan" married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "<a href="../w/anwhite.html">Annatje White</a>" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Beginning in 1779, nine children were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rHJWAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22jurriaen+and+anna%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiZrNLA_o3KAhUK7iYKHQPLA2MQ6AEIJzAC#v=onepage&q=annatie%20white&f=false">christened</a> at the church to Jurrian <a href="../../res/sp.html">and</a> Anna. Both parents were occasional baptism sponsors.

      <p>By the end of the war (if not earlier), these Hogans were living on a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=george+hogan+bethlehem&source=bl&ots=_tMbTTzACh&sig=gwHS-gq0TB8HJ6RvFP_pmRmUl0E&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjoraGS5Y_KAhVESyYKHb1jBaIQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&q=hogan%20&f=false">300-acre 
        farm</a> that adjoined the Winne property in what would become Bethlehem. 
      <p>In May 1787, he was named co-executor of the estate in the <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan4398.html">will</a> filed by his father. No wife was named for the testator whose heirs included three sons, four daughters, and two grandsons (Henry J. and Jurian). In January <a href="../../sources.html#en">1793</a>, letters of administration were granted to him and his <a href="../e/beevertse7954.html">brother-in-law</a>  as administrators of the estate of their deceased brother Marte Hogan. At their direction, the outstanding parts of Martin's estate (a "Negro man," livestock, hay, and grains and then household and farm items) were inventoried and then sold.  

      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#geho">1790</a>, the household of "George 
        Hogan" was configured on the census for the southern part of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. 
        Perhaps Martin lived with him. The household also included three slaves. 
      <p>Jurrian Hogan was dead by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> when his Albany holdings were assessed to "Alida Bradt and others heirs." In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, his lot on Pearl Street was assessed to his heirs.  The <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> of Jurian Hogan passed probate in January 1813.</p>
