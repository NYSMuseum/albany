<P>According to subsequent information, future Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Hinderer, Jr.</strong></a> was born about 1769. He probably was the son of Albany resident <a href="jahinderer.html">Jacob Hinderer</a> and may have been a native of what became Columbia County.

<p>By the 1770s, the Hinderers were living in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and soon would be identified among the city's prominent <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutherans</a>. In 1795, church records gave Jacob Jr's. age as twenty-six. Between 1793 and '95, a Jacob "Henter" rented property from the church near Lodge and Pine Streets.

<p>His wife was named Margaret who was eighteen years old in 1795.

<p>Becinning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, "Jacob Jr." was known as a baker and was qualified as a juror and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">freeholder</a>.
<p>Jacob Hinderer, Jr. He was not named on the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1790c">census</a> during that time. Perhaps, he was accounted for under the households of his father (whose household included a man of this subject's age in <a href="../../census1800.html#8467">1800</a>) or of his brother.

<p>As late as 1811, he was identified as a member of the First Lutheran church.

<p>In 1814 and 1815, "Jacob Henderer, Jur." was listed among the city's licensed cartmen. After that, his name drops for community rolls. 

<p>We <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now <a href="../qqqq.html">seeking</a> defining information on the later life and passing of the Albany resident known as Jacob Hinderer, Jr.</p>
