<P>Based on subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#nihi">info</a>rmation, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Hilton</strong></a> was born prior to 1774. Other same-named contemporaries are <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/hilton/messages/2419.html">at risk</a> in the region. This sketch focuses on the Nicholas Hilton who lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> in 1800.

<p>We expect that he was a member of the Albany <a href="hilton.html">Hilton</a> family. However, specific documentation of his origins has not been recovered from Albany church records except for the burial of the child of "Nichs J. Hilton" in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in February 1802. In those days, most Albany Hiltons were associated with <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican/Episcopal Church.

<p>This individual was married and had a family. <a href="http://www.bernehistory.org/FamilyFiles/Family.aspx?IndividualID=I01558">Perhaps</a> his wife was one Phoebe Hurst. During the 1790s, they <a href="http://bettyfink1.com/helderb03.htm">christened</a> children at the "Helderberg Reformed Church" in Guilderland where the Hurst family had set down roots.

<p>In August 1798, the name of Nicholas Hilton from Albany appeared on a <a href="http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-22-02-0056-0002#ARHN-01-22-02-0056-0002">list of men</a> recommended by Alexander Hamilton for commissions in the army. Hilton was characterized as of good reputation, the son of a Mechanic, and would make a "tolerable" Ensign. His name was among those forwarded to the Secretary of War.  

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#nihi">1800</a>, his household in the first ward was configured on the Albany city census. At that time, a man aged 26-45, two girls under 10, and a woman 26-45 were enumerated in that dwelling. A year earlier, his lots in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of the city were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessed</a> modestly. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the city census counted four females and two free people of color in that household. In <a href="../../census1800.html#watervliet">1800</a>, a second Nicholas Hilton was listed on the census for Watervliet.

<p>Perhaps his widow "Phebe Hilton" was was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA70&lpg=PA70&dq=%22hilton+phebe%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hilton%20phebe%22&f=false">identified</a> as the proprietor of a "morroc., hat & cap store, 134 Market" in 1813. Perhaps a different Nicholas Hilton was identified as a carpenter on subsequent <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a>.
 
<p>The life story of this Nicholas Hilton is still evolving. With unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">q</a>uestions and issues, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
