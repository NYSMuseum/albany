<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Geertruy Hilton</strong></a> was born in June 1734. She was the daughter of <a href="rihilton7618.html">Ryckert</a> (Richard) and <a href="../b/maben7316.html">Maria Bennewe</a> Hilton. She grew up as a middle child in the first ward <a href="../../census1756.html#177">home</a> of a mainline carpenter. 

<p>In June 1752, she married one <a href="../d/jodaniels7758.html">John Daniels</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time both partners were identified as single people of Albany. The marriage produced a daughter - born in April 1753 and a son christened in February 1755. However, Daniels had died at the end of 1754. In February 1761, the then 27-year-old widow married <a href="../d/vodawson7796.html">Volkert Dawson</a> also at the Albany church. By 1778, that marriage produced five children christened at the Dutch church - one of whom was named "Rykert."

      <p>These Dawsons lived on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> 
        near the homes of her long-lived father and of other Hilton kin as well. 
        Volkert was an Albany jailer and otherwise a marginal character living 
        in the first ward. He appears to have died in 1808. We are less certain 
        about Geertruy's lifespan. 
      <p>After "Geertruy Dawson" witnessed a baptism in February 1780, we have not encountered her name again in the community-based record. However, she may have been accounted for in Dawson's household as configured on the first ward census in <a href="../../census1790.html#7796">1790</a>.

<p>Past diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany native and mother Geertruy Hilton Daniels Dawson.</p>
