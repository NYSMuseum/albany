<strong>William Henry</strong></a> seems to have been born in Scotland about 1764. He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been the son of James and Nancy Herron Henry and to have emigrated to America with his parents in 1775. <a href="#sources2">T</a>hey soon came to Albany and rented a house near the <a href="../../stpeters.html">English church</a>. After only two weeks, they are said to have moved to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">S</a>chenectady, then on to  Schoharie, Rensselaersville, and then to the "Nichols" farm in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>.

<p>William married <a href="../a/analex8409.html">Ann Alexander</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in December 1785. By 1797, the marriage had produced at least four children including future scientist <a href="joshenry.html">Joseph Henry</a>. These Henrys were members of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. 


<p>William Henry was known as a laborer and then as a <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sl</a>ooper. By <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8429">1788</a>, they had settled in a modest house on the west <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#bottom">side</a> of what became South Pearl Street. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8429">1790</a>, his family included five members. A decade later, the first ward <a href="../../census1800.html#8429">census</a> showed his maturing household. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, twenty-five years after his marriage, his household still had eight resident members. 

<p>An interview with Joseph Henry in 1878 yielded information that "his own father had a sloop on the Hudson . . . was not a man of temperate habits and died in a fit of delerium tremens. This made a lasting impression on his mind."

<p>William Henry died in October 1811 just before his forty-eighth birthday. He was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Presbyterian church plot. In June 1814, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration were issued on his estate. His widow lived in Albany and survived until 1835. Even before his father's death, young Joseph Henry was sent to live  with William's parents in Galway, New York. He returned a decade later and the rest is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?q=%22joseph+henry%22&source=bll&ei=tUTOSfGZAdPqlQfN9OHICQ&sa=X&oi=book_group&resnum=12&ct=title&cad=bottom-3results">history</a>.</p>

The life of William Henry is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 8429. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. He does not seem to have been closely related to the Albany family of trader <a href="rhenry8425.html">Robert Henry</a>.
