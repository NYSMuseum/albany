<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>William Heyer</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Hyer) most likely was the brother of Albany resident <a href="geheyer8443.html">Gerrit Heyer</a>. If so, his father would have been William Heyer of New York City. A number of same-named contemporaries are at-risk in the region. We seek defining information on William's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Unlike other contemporary "Heyers," his name has not been found in the available records of the Albany Dutch <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> and thus seems to not have married.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#472">1779</A> his personal property was valued moderately within another household on the Albany assessment roll for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Then, in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October</a>, his property in about the same location was valued this time as two parcels (often meaning both real and personal property). A city-wide assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>, taxed only "<a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8443">Gerret Hyer</a>" and not William.

<p>In October 1779, he was identified as an enlisted man in the militia company commanded by Captain John Price. <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pKMlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA384&lpg=PA384&dq=%22william+hyer%22+albany&source=bl&ots=vItdLxc7JH&sig=RfKbiNKFGclWUYILtcP7Js_o7Do&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-tKTupdPQAhXo6YMKHbS8BLIQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&q=%22william%20hyer%22%20albany&f=false">Papers</a> submitted at Albany asked that "William Heyer" be held back from active duty as he was "the only good <a href="../../trades/leather.html">sadler</a> we have employed in public service and consequently is wanted here." Commander <a href="../l/morlewis.html">Morgan Lewis</a>'s request appears to have been granted by General <a href="../t/abtbroeck6.html">Ten Broeck</a>.

<p>In April 1782, a "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=wd-LTleLtO8C&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=%22witnesses+william+hyer%22&source=bl&ots=MemF0FfEV1&sig=KFtuFfYPnQQC0LRBzr22JV4qK8k&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwig5u-DpdPQAhXs5oMKHRzpALIQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&q=%22witnesses%20william%20hyer%22&f=false">William Hyer</a>" was among the witnesses to the will filed by a soldier in Dutchess County. Perhaps this William Heyer served as well. However, unlike <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8443">Gerrit Heyer</a>, his name was not included among those receiving land bounty rights for service with the Albany militia regiment even though the name "William Hyer" has appeared under "enlisted men" on <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_levies_albany.htm">other listings</a> for the First Albany regiment.

<p>In <a href="https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/24949987/craft-masonry-in-albany-county-new-york-onondaga-and-oswego-/97">1783</a>,  "William Hyer" signed in at the (Masters) Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> lodge.

<p>In April <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hhkgAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=%22william+heyer%22+albany&source=bl&ots=JmhT5kC2qE&sig=_fccwA2i_dAHjGTtKDOwFBKZitI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZvvHWvdPQAhXo6IMKHdohD7MQ6AEIODAG#v=onepage&q=%22william%20heyer%22%20albany&f=false">1786</a>, "William Heyer" was among those at Albany who signed a document relating to the receipt [?] of paper money.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#8443">1790</a>, he probably was counted within the household of Gerrit Heyer. However, a number of similarly named <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/colonel-william-hyer_671909">individuals</a> were listed as heads of households elsewhere in New York State.

      <p>In August 1797, "Gerrit Heyer's brother" was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> 
        from the Dutch church. <a href="../../res/guess.html">If</a> the above 
        connections are valid, this interment marked the end of the life of the 
        Albany bachelor known as William Heyer.</p>
