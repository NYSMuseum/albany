      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Hallenbeck</b></a> was born in 1692. He 
        was the son of Albany residents <a href="ichallenbeck5215.html">Isaac 
        Casperse</a> and <a href="../b/dobosch2037.html">Dorothy Bosch</a> Hallenbeck. 
        He grew up in a large family in the first ward but lost his father in 
        1709.</p>
      <p>He married <a href="../b/subradt4279.html">Susanna Bradt</a> in 1718. 
        By 1746, thirteen of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where Hendrick was a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>
      <p>Many years later, Hendrick called himself a "<a href="../vs/ghvschoon5887.html#yeoman">yeoman</a>." 
        Although his primary occupation escapes more precise definition, he was 
        a moderately successful holder of extensive lands stretching south and 
        east from the city's settled core. He belonged to the city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company and served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
        and constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In 1730, 
        he was appointed high constable. From about <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5274">1720</a> 
        until his death, Hendrick Hallenbeck was an Albany <a href="#mainstay">mainstay</a>.</p>
      <p>This family set up their home on Albany's <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> 
        in a home formerly owned by a garrison officer. In time, his holdings 
        may have extended across the entire southeastern part of the city - from 
        what became <a href="../../streets.html#hal">Hallenbeck Street</a>, across 
        South Pearl, and east to the river; and, from about Hudson Street all 
        the way to the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a>. How 
        he acquired such a large <a href="../../res/realestate.html">tract</a> 
        of city land is not immediately clear.</P>
      <p>Hendrick Hallenbeck died in July 1766. His <a href="../../wills/willhhalenbeek5674.html">will</a> 
        passed probate a month later. It devised a substantial estate to his wife 
        and then among a large family. It also established a family burial ground 
        along South Pearl Street! His widow probably was buried there in 1787.
