<P><a href="#sources"><b>Debora Hansen</b></a> was born in August 1693. She was the daughter of Albany <a href="../../cityfathers.html">leader</a> and businessman <a href="hehansen4939.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../vd/dvdam6351.html">Deborah Van Dam</a> Hansen .</p>


<p>She married Albany native <a href="../b/jabeekman3890.html">Jacob Beekman</a> in December 1714. By 1733, six of her children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>These Beekmans lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> while Jacob was on his way to establishing himself in the community before an untimely death in March 1739. His will left a considerable estate for the use of his widow. Previously, she had inherited from her father - a one-time <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany.</p>


<p>Debora Hansen Beekman did not enjoy a long life either. Although she was left use of the estate of her husband in his <a href="../../wills/willjabeekman.html">will</a> filed in 1738, she died in December 1745 at the age of fifty-two. She was buried from the Albany Dutch church. Her son, <a href="../b/jojabeekman3866.html">Johannes</a>, was appointed mayor of Albany in 1783. </p>
