<strong>Richard Hilton</strong></a> was born in March 1701. He was the son of former soldier <a href="wmhilton.html">William Hilton</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vb/anvberk.html">Anna Van Berkhoven</a> Hilton. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home of a marginal trader. William Hilton's offspring enjoyed more lasting success. </P>

<p>In December 1726, "Ryckert" married <a href="../b/maben7316.html">Maria Bennewe</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740, seven children had been christened in the Albany church where both parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>Ryckert Hilton was a <a href="../../census1756.html#177">carpenter</a> who set up his home on "the Plain" in the first ward. He may have lived with or next to his brother, wampum maker <a href="jahilton7523.html">Jacobus Hilton</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#177">1756</a>, their home was called a "good house." He performed wood-related services for the city government over several decades and was a sergeant in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> as well. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#7618">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#7618">1763</a>, he was identified as an Albany freeholder.

<p>He may have been the "Richard Hilton" who signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#7618">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty in 1766. During those years, his name appeared on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> along with that of his son.  In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=%22richard+hilton&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22richard%20hilton&f=false">1773</a>, he was called as a witness in an election trial. As late as <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7618">1788</a>, his property still appeared on the first ward assessment. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7618">1790</a>, his household included seven family members.

<p>In August 1772, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> called him an insolvent debtor.

<p>In his seventies at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he still may have been the "Richard Hilton" who received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7618">land bountry right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<P>Richard Hilton died in January 1795. He <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/burnewsp.html">was</a> ninety-seven, "the oldest man in the city, and had for many years been afflicted by an enormous wen on his left cheek, about 15 inches in circumference." His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in 1806.</p>
