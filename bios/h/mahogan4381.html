      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Martina Hogan</strong></a> was born in October 
        1750. She was the daughter of Albany blacksmith <a href="wmhogan4398.html">William 
        Hogan</a> and his wife, <a href="../l/sulansing3682.html">Susanna Lansing</a> 
        Hogan. She was named for her <a href="../b/marbecker6044.html">grandmother</a> 
        and grew up in a large family on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">South 
        side</a> of Albany. 
      <p>In July 1771, she married Albany native <a href="../e/beevertse7954.html">Bernardus 
        Evertsen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1792, the marriage had produced at least six children. 
      <p>These Evertsens were Albany <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7954">mainstays</a> 
        for three decades - as Bernardus was known as a tanner and cordwainer. 
        In May 1787, Martina was named in the <a href="../../wills/willwmhogan4398.html">will</a> 
        filed by her father. 
      <P>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7954">1790</a> and in <a href="../../census1800.html#7954">1800</a>, 
        she was accounted for in the third ward household headed by Bernardus 
        Evertson. 
      <p>Martina Hogan Evertsen lost her husband in 1802. The fifty-two-year-old 
        widow took over as head of their <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
        Street</a> home and her late husband's other holdings as well. She died 
        in May 1807 and was buried in the Dutch church cemetery plot.</p>
