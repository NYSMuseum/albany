<strong>Anna Hilton</strong></a> was born in February 1744. She was the daughter of <a href="jahilton7523.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="../m/jumartin7524.html">Judik Martin</a> Hilton. Sometimes, she was referred to as "Nancy." She grew up as part of a large family in a craftsman's <a href="../../census1756.html#177">home</a> on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. 

<p>In October 1767, she married <a href="abhoog3583.html">Abraham Hooghkerk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  By 1785, six children had been christened in the church where she was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>This Hooghkerk family also made its home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Abraham operated the family brickyard. Their house was located on <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver Street</a> - just east of <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#state">South Pearl</a>.

<p> Abraham Hooghkerk died in May 1807. However, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> did not pass probate until January 1814. By that time, the home of Widow Ann Hooghkerk at 38 Beaver Street was a regular feature of the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.


<p>Anna Hilton Hooghkerk was alone in her home on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> of 1820. She was still listed in the directory in 1822. She died some time afterwards.</p>
