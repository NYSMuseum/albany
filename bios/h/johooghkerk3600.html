<strong>Johannes Hooghkerk</strong></a> was born in July 1747. He was a younger son in the large family of <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> residents <a href="luhoog3604.html">Lucas</a> and <a href="../f/refonda3840.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Hooghkerk. His mother died in 1750 - following the birth of her last child.

<p>Early in <a href="../../solconst.html#3600">1766</a>, he joined his Albany neighbors in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. The next year, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. He belonged to the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html#3600">Masonic Lodge</a>.

<p>About that time, his name began to appear on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> under the house of his father. He was a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> and his father, a <a href="../../census1756.html#168">britchesmaker</a>.  In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, he was the owner of record on first ward property.

<p>At the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, he was commissioned as an ensign and then lieutenant in an Albany company. From 1776 until he resigned in January 1779, he was a first lieutenant in the Fourth <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">New York Regiment</a>. Afterwards, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3600">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.


<p>In August 1776, he married <a href="../m/mamartin8563.html">Elizabeth/Margaret Martin</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1785, the marriage had produced five children - the last one, Alida, was christened with her father being "deceased." 

<p>In November 1784, his corner house opposite the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> Meeting House at Pearl and Beaver <a href="../../ag.html">was</a> to be the site of a new school.

<p>Johannes Hooghkerk died in March 1785 and was buried in the church plot. He had lived less than thirty-eight years. His widow lived on at 37 <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver Street</a> for many years and died in 1835.</p>
