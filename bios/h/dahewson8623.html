<P>This <a href="#sources">
<strong>Daniel Hewson</strong></a> probably was born about 1730. He was the son of Albany newcomer <a href="dahewson8622.html">Daniel Hewson, Sr.</a> and his wife. He was known fairly consistently as "Daniel Hewson, Jr." He grew up in a shoemaker's home on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">southside</a> of Albany.</P>

<p>In June 1760, he married Albany spinster <a href="../b/mabarret7230.html">Mary Barrett</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../makers.html#leather">cordwainer</a>. Over the next decade, a number of children were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>  including St. Peter's where he was a member and church officer. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1750">1750</a>, Daniel Hewson, Jr. was appointed constable for the first ward. During the 1760s, his name began to appear on Albany rolls - <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">particularly</a> on tax lists under the first ward holdings of his father. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8623">1788</a>, his modest personal property was assessed under the house (tavern) of <a href="../l/rolewis.html">Robert Lewis</a>.  In <a href="../../census1790.html#8623">1790</a>, the households of <a href="../../census1790.html#dh">two</a> Daniel  Hewsons were enumerated in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<P>During the 1760s and as late as 1779, Daniel Hewson, Jr. served in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.  He later was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8623">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>However, in March 1781, this Albany cordwainer was charged with joining the British in Canada the previous year. He surrendered himself at Ft. Schuyler, was <a href="../../cddc.html">examined</a>,  and then confined. However, in March he posted a bond and was released.</p>

<p>Daniel Hewson, Jr. lived into the 1790s. We seek information on Daniel Jr.'s later life and passing.</p>
