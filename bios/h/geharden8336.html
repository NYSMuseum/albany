<strong>Gerrit Hardenburgh</strong></a> was <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born at Maersen, Utrecht in February 1639. He was the son of Jan Jacobse who brought his family to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and settled in New Amsterdam.


<p>Gerrit Janse married Manhattan native <a href="../s/jaschepmoes.html">Jaepie Schepmoes</a> in 1666. By 1683, the marriage had produced at least eight children.

<p>Within a few years of his marriage, he re-located to Albany and purchased a houselot on Chapel Street and Maiden Lane in 1669. Over the next decade, he bought and sold other parcels within the Albany stockade. He was a member and supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. His daughter was christened in the Albany church in October 1683.

<p>Perhaps like his father, Gerrit Janse was a Hudson River slooper. As late as 1690, he is said to have captained a sloop named the <i>Royal Albany</i> that was placed in service against the French by <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a>.

<p>In December 1678, Gerrit Hardenburgh filed a joint will with his wife. It was written in Dutch and has been partially preserved.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#8336">1679</a>, his name appeared on a census of Albany householders. Two years later, he joined other traders in <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#8336">petitioning</a> the Albany court for closer regulation of the fur trade. During those years he had land on the hill in Albany on or near Pearl Street.

<p>By 1686, he was living in New York and belonged to the Dutch church there. He died sometime after 1690.

<p>His only son, Johannes of Ulster County, was a principal recipient of the vast <a href="http://www.dcnyhistory.org/hardenburghpatentbobboyd.html">Hardenburgh Patent</a> in 1708.
