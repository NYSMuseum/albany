<P>Based on subsequent  <a href="../../census1800.html#8326">info</a>rmation, <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Hammer</strong></a> was born after 1755 and was <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been from England. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Sometime after 1790, he is <a href="http://chestermasoniclodge.com/tb/trestle_2010_08.html">said</a> to have established a printing business in Albany with <a href="../w/thswebb.html">Thomas Smith Webb</a>. At that time, Hammer was said to have been active in the Masonic "Lodge of Antiquiety" of London. He is <a href="http://grandlodgeofiowa.org/docs/LodgeDegrees/RitualandtheMasonicLodge.pdf">said</a> to have brought the seminal Masonic work from England to Albany in 1793. He was a member and officer of the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic lodge</a> and is said to have taught Webb and thought to have influenced Webb's Masonic adaptations. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qEEZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22john+hammer%22+albany&source=bl&ots=SThAOf9Isz&sig=shXlQ3cXlN4O9wJw-UQrttH3D2I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=x8bMT5CgFufq0gHQ28iYDA&sqi=2&ved=0CEwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20hammer%22%20albany%20&f=false">Perhaps</a> he was in Boston with Webb at a masonic gathering in 1797. At that time, he was identified as the secretary of his Lodge.

<p>In July 1796, he <a href="http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/1796-letter-albany-ny-cockburn-to-hutton+"> witnessed</a> an estate-related agreement created in Albany.
                             
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot in the first ward was assessed moderately. He also owned a lot located in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> in conjunction with <a href="../p/jopye.html">John Pye</a>.
<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#8326">1800</a>, his second ward household included only a man and a woman of Hammer's general age.

<p>Traditional sources agree that Hammer came to Albany in 1793 and <a href=http://www.guttenberg737.org/docs/Albany%20Temple%20NY%20Times%20Article%201895.pdf"">remained</a> for seven years. After 1800, his name has not been recovered duiring our sweep of subsequent community-based records or from our latest search of <a href="../../res/irs.html">IRS</a> in June 2012. Our task is complicated by the existence of same-named contemporaries. Consequently, we move on for now still <a href="../qqqq.html">seeking</a> information on his family life, Albany-specific activities, later life, and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.</p>
