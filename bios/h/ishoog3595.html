<strong>Isaac Hooghkerk</strong></a> was born in March 1737. He was the son of <a href="luhoog3604.html">Lucas</a> and <a href="../f/refonda3840.html">Rebecca Fonda</a> Hooghkerk. He was an older son in a large family but lost his mother in 1750. He grew up around his father's lime kiln and <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">brickyard</a> in the uphill section of the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 

<p>In Octobver 1763, he married <a href="../vz/ravzandt313.html">Rachel Van Zandt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1778, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>Initially intending to become a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cord</a>wainer, Isaac soon became a brickmaker - supplying a number of public and private building projects in Albany. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">modest</a> home was <a href="../../census1790.html#3595">near</a> those of his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3595">brothers</a>.  He held an additional lot in the first ward as well. He served as a firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1765">1765</a> and in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. 

<p>Although he supplied bricks for repairing the barracks in 1776 and contributed for firewood a year earlier, he seek more information on the <a href="../../or/or-as.html">wartime</a> activities of this Albany mainliner who turned forty in 1777.

<p>After the war, he still operated the family brickyard on land leased from the city.  

<p>In  <a href="../../census1800.html#3595">1800</a>, his home was served by three slaves. 

<p>Isaac Hooghkerk died in September 1809 and was buried from the church. He had lived seventy-two years. His will passed probate in 1818.</p>
