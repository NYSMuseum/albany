<P>Spelled <a href="../../res/sp.html">and</a> referred to variously, the first <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Hinderer</strong></a> was born about 1720. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. A <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a>, he probably was of <a href="../ger.html">German</a> ancestry. 

<p>By 1755, he had married Margaret (<a href="http://www.mundia.com/au/Person/6579032/-1266948234">Anna Margaretta Kuhn</a>). Before her <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/EbLuthCem.htm">death</a> in 1795, the marriage produced several children who probably also became Albany residents.

<p>In April 1765, he was identified as a Lutheran, a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cordwainer</a>, and of the Manor of Livingston when he was <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a>.

<p>In October <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA250&lpg=PA250&dq=%22jacob+henderer%22+albany&source=bl&ots=jw6N_vpaeT&sig=7qUdNgWyA75GLWaCRwV0zKjmgHI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KjffUJGnOJG10QGK5oDIBA&ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22jacob%20henderer%22%20albany&f=false">1773</a>, he was in Albany when he was called before the <a href="../../corporation.html">Common Council</a> to attest to statements made by individuals related to a voting bribery case.

<p>We seek informaton for him during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">struggle</a> for American independence.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8467">1779</a>, his house and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> were valued on two Albany assessments.


<p>As early as 1787, he was counted as a member of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, no Jacob Hinderer was counted among the heads of households in New York State. However, in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his Pine Street house and lot were valued on the second ward assessment rolls. In <a href="../../census1800.html#8467">1800</a>, his household numbered three adults (including a younger couple) and four children. The second ward assessment for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a> valued his holdings similarly.


<p>A widower for over a decade, Jacob Hinderer was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/EbLuthCem.htm">buried</a> from the Lutheran Ebenezer Church in early January 1806. This Albany resident had lived for seventy-four years. </p>
