<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Casper Jacobse</strong></a> was born about 1620. He is said to have been of German ancestry. He emigrated to New Netherland and worked as a day laborer and then tenant farmer in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 


<p>His wife was named Maria or Elizabeth or both. Between 1650 and 1660, three children were christened in greater New Netherland. He was identified as of the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> faith.

<p>After first leasing a house, he was present in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> at the initial distribution of houselots in 1653. He bought and sold real estate in Albany and its environs. It seems he was known as "Casper Jacobse on the hill" - perhaps located just above (West of) the stockaded settlement that became Albany.

<p>His family also became intertwined with the settlement of what became southern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.

<p>Casper Jacobse Hallenbeck filed a will in September 1685. He is said to have died in August 1703.

<p>Casper Jacobse was the patriarch of the Albany Hallenbeck family. His youngest <a href="ichallenbeck5215.html">son</a> became a resident of Albany.</p>
