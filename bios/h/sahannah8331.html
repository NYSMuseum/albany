<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Hannah</strong></a> appears to have been born before 1756 - perhaps as early as <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22samuel+hannah%22+albany&source=bl&ots=x7DVVObLvn&sig=W2EhyDXEvSsHMbNNcvG2xz60-7w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LhshUb6PN_O-0QGQxIC4AQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20hannah%22%20albany&f=false">1738</a>. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>In August 1785, he married "Agnes Malhilh" (perhaps Dunse <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Mc Hench or Mulhench) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In the years that followed, at least two daughters were christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#8331">1790</a>, the Albany census noted a man and three females in his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#8331">later</a>, his family included a couple over forty-five years of age and an adolescent girl. Asessmennt rolls for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8331">1788</a>, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a> located his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a> and assessed his holdings moderately.

<p>Presbyterian burial grounds inscriptions <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22samuel+hannah%22+albany&source=bl&ots=x7DVVObLvn&sig=W2EhyDXEvSsHMbNNcvG2xz60-7w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LhshUb6PN_O-0QGQxIC4AQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20hannah%22%20albany&f=false">noted</a> that Samuel Hannah died on April 9, 1809 at the age of seventy-one. His widow survived until 1838 when she was interred with him at the age of ninety-two.

<p><a href="../../res/guess.html">If</a> the profile offered here relates to a single individual, serious gaps have escaped our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Int</a>ernet-based resources. Beyond diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
