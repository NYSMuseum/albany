<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional resources, this <a href="#sources"> <strong>Sara Marselis</strong></a> was born during the 1720s (perhaps in February 1727 to Dirck <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/forum/surnames/topics/mcmichael/287/">and</a> 
        Elizabeth Van Epps Marselis) and was a daughter of the Schenectady <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/mci_og.html">branch</a> 
        of the Marselis family. We seek more definitive information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>. 
<p>In June 1748, she appears to have <a href="http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rbillard/schenectady_marriages.htm">married</a> 
        one <a href="damcmichael.html">Daniel "Mc Master"</a> at the <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/13.html">Dutch 
        church</a> in Schenectady. The first of a number of <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/mci_og.html">children</a> 
        (known <a href="../../res/sp.html">variously</a> but most frequently as 
        "Mc Michael") was christened in Schenectady between May 1749 and 1758. 
        A son was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        in June 1752. A number of her offspring became Schenectady residents. 
<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, Sara was a widow and was identified as the principal of the "Halfway house" on the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html ">King's Highway</a>. Those holdings were assessed moderately. In September of 1767, "Sarah McMichal" was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=%22sarah+mcmichal%22&source=bl&ots=jx4JWCq6i-&sig=uhVvPKtDTHlZzCDX_Rf4uvSwLP8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o9thVf3HDNXbsAS4noLgAg&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22sarah%20mcmichal%22&f=false">identified</a> as the widow of Daniel and in debt to the city of Albany for rents. In April 1770, she paid Daniel's "full debt" and was granted a deed to the house at the "Verberg" for twenty-one years at &pound;4+ per year.

<p>In February 1771, the account book of <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>'s manager and bookkeeper <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/papersofsirwilli13johnuoft#page/570/mode/2up">noted</a> that "Wid. Mc Michael" was paid for shipping a barrel of limes and a crate of cheese from Albany to Johnson Hall.

<p>After that, we have not yet encountered additional references to Sara Marselis Mc Michael in our most recent sweeps of community and Internet-based resources. With many unanswered questions on her life, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now</p>
