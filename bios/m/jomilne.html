<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Milne</b></a> was an Anglican missionary and rector of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> church in Albany from late in 1727 to 1736. <a href="../../res/ts.html">P</a>reviously, he had taught school and was thought to have had some medical training as well.</p>

<p>After the long illness and death in 1726 of Rev. Thomas Barclay, Milne's arrival was a welcome sight for Albany's growing English-speaking population. As with most Anglican clerics, Milne also was a missionary serving at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a> and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> as well as in Albany.</p>

<p>Milne served well in these posts for <a href="../../stpeters.html#milne">almost a decade</a> - increasing church membership, focusing on education, and rebuilding an  Albany church damaged by fire in 1731.</p>

<p>On November 1, 1728, he married <a href="../vc/mavc.html">Maria Van Cortlandt</a>, the widow of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>In 1736, he began serving as missionary to Monmouth, New Jersey. Soon after, he left Albany for the rectorship of Shrewsbury Christ Church. He preached there until April 1744 and then left Anglican service.</p>


<p>In 1744, he was identified as the resident farmer on <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle Island</a> by <a href="../../art/ham.html">Dr. Alexander Hamilton</a> - the traveller and a friend. He called his host's home "Milne's Island." Hamilton's <a href="../../art/ham.html#friend">observations</a> offer some perspective on Milne's character. Hamilton found Milne to be an avid agriculturalist who grew wheat and peas. He also learned that Milne had practiced <a ref="../../trades/medical.html">medicine</a> in Albany for many years.</p>
