<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Alida Marselis</strong></a> was born in May 1715. She was the first daughter born to the marriage of Myndert and Feytie Oothout Marselis. They raised a large family in the countryside around Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#rw">1742</a> (and perhaps into the 1760s), her father was listed among the freeholders living in  <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck.

<p>In April 1738, Alida married <a href="../vh/vovh6419.html">Volkert Van Hoesen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By the mid-1750s, the marriage had produced nine children. She was a pewholder at the Albany church into the 1790s.

<p>Although Volkert occasionally performed contract chores for the city government, these Van Hoesens probably raised their family in the Albany hinterland.

<p>Perhaps Alida became a widow in July 1762 when a Volkert Van Hoesen was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> from the church. 

<p> Alida Marselis Van Hoesen had died by 1793, when a notation in the church pew roster marked her as "deceased." Beyond  that reference from the 1790s, the name of Alida Van Hoesen has not yet been encountered in the coummunity-based record. Perhaps she lived out her days in the Albany-area homes of her many surviving offspring.</p>
