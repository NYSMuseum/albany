<P>Based on subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#jamg2">res</a>ources, this <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Mc Gourck</strong></a> (identified here as the younger) was born between 1756 and 1774. This Albany resident's life is distinct from his older, <a href="jamgourck.html">same-named</a> contemporary who we <a href="../../res/guess.html">be</a>lieve died in 1804. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and possible family connections in Albany.

      <p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#jamg2">1800</a>, the census shows only 
        an age appropriate man in the <a href="jamgourck.html">sec</a>ond, second 
        ward household of James Mc Gourk." <a href="../../res/guess.html">For 
        now</a>, we say it is James the younger - even without other people in 
        residence and even though most of the other qualitative information on 
        him locates him in the first ward
      <p>In January 1790, James Mc Gourck married Sarah Phelps at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal Church. Two months later their child was christened at the State Street church. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jamg2">1790</a>, his first ward household showed one man and two females on the Albany census. A decade later, a man between 26 and forty-four  was <a href="../../census1800.html#jamg2">listed</a> alone in a house in the second ward.

<p>During the 1790s, "James Mc Gourk" purchased a number of lots on <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver Street</a> and along the <a href="../../loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> from members of the <a href="../vb/vbt.html">Van Benthuysen</a> and Shepherd families. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward, house and lot were valued moderately.

<p>In 1804, he was <a href="#miss">identified</a> as a resident of Beaver Street who boarded Senators George Tiffany and <a href="../w/jowoodworth.html">John Woodworth</a>.

<p>After that, his name has not yet been encountered in the community-based record.  With much uncertainty regarding the contemporary Albany James <a href="../../res/sp.html">Mc Gourcks</a> and with outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> about the later life and passing of this subject, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move</a> on for now. </p>
