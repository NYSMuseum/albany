<strong>Anna Marshall</strong></a> probably was born during the 1740s. We expect to connect her to the Albany Marshall family and to not confuse her with <a href="anmarshall7067.html">Anna Marshall</a> Abel who was born in 1752, married, and lived in Albany until her death in 1828.

<p>In April 1769, this Anna (or a <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iant such as "Johanna") married <a href="../w/jowilk6890.html">John Wilkinson</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the next two decades, a number of children were christened in Albany churches. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6890">1790</a>, their household included six children - five were boys under sixteen. Absent from the census in 1800, in 1810, the John Wilkinson household included eleven members.

<p><a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> mainstays for much of the last three decades of the eighteenth century, this Wilkinson family lived at what became 203 South Pearl Street where Jacob and then John Wilkinson (perhaps sons) supported them with carpentry work at least until <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1822</a>. 

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Anna Marshall Wilkinson
