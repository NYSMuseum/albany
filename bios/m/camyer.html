<P>In <a href="../../census1790.html#camy">1790</a>, the household of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Carol Myer</a>" was configured on the Albany <a href="#census">census</a> for the second ward. We begin here by seeking defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Following that, a more certain    understanding of his most accurate <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> identification would be a next logical step forward. 

<p>In August 1778, "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=H6pCAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA204&lpg=PA204&dq=%22carle+meyer%22&source=bl&ots=SRY_Gs3S5B&sig=ASjXZzaJCFh0QcfIvKfQpcHHDSs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEp-jYgbLYAhXFLyYKHYGzBQUQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&q=%22carle%20meyer%22&f=false">Carle Meyer</a>" was among a large group identified as Hessian deserters brought before the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a> where he took an oath of neutrality. A number of German soldiers named "Carle" were noted in the <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IwobAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA618&lpg=PA618&dq=meyer,+carle&source=bl&ots=R3X1kVrZo1&sig=3J3b4pqrpwtO5jFZAHhmvrWb_90&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9s--d27nYAhUKJiYKHQgTD5UQ6AEIPTAE#v=onepage&q=meyer%2C%20carle&f=false">index</a> to the <a href="../../sources.html#cp"><i>Clinton Papers</i></a>. We have yet to connect any of those Germans to a New World life in Albany or its <a href="../../albanycounty.html">environs</a>. 

<p>The listing of "Carol Myer" as a head of a second ward household in 1790 (with an adult male and two unspecified females - the sole source for that decade) prompts us to seek to establish his connection to the community through its churches, civil government records, business accounts, probate records, newspapers, and other <a href="../../cbr.html">community based resources</a>.

<p>The variable <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelling</a> his <a href="../ger.html">German</a> sounding surname further complicates our ambitions toward locating him on the <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a>.  At this point, those investigations have proved umnproductive.

<p>Past diminishing returns, and mindful that we are missing important elements of his life, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of Albany householder Carol Myer.
