<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, future Albany mainstay <a href="#sources"><strong>John Mc Gourck</strong></a> was born in Northern <a href="../irish.html">Ir</a>eland in 1758. He then came to America at age fourteen which could have placed him in Albany just <a href="../../lastdays.html">before</a> the war. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">information</a> connects him to wartime service in the New York Line. At the time of his enlistment, he later testified that he lived with businessman <a href="../c/jacaldwell7509.html">James Caldwell</a>. He also served in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company captained by <a href="../p/joprice6447.html">John Price</a>. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1113">land bounty right</a>. A Federal pension was issued to his widow following his death.

<p>In September <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">1781</a>, he was elected to serve as constable in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. However, the <a href="../../corporation.html">Council</a> found that Mc Gourck had been "underage" at the time of the voting and a new election needed to be held.

<p>His name has not been found on the census for New York State in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. Perhaps he was living in one of the four Mc Gourck-named   households configured on the city census.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> and again in 1802, his house and lot in the second ward was valued on the city census.

<p>In September 1798, he married Margaret Jackson at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church where he had been a member since at least 1785. Their children were christened there during the 1800s.

<p>The second ward census in <a href="../../census1800.html#1113">1800</a> counted three small children and two adults in his household.


<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22m'gourky+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22m'gourky+john%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was listed in the city directory at 23 North Pearl Street and he was identified as a chocolate maker. As late as 1830, the Albany directory listed him as a "chocolate manufacturer" located at 4 <a href="../../streets.html#orange">Van Schaick</a> Street.

<p>In August 1833, he applied for a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">pension</a> for service in the Revolution. The application detailed the particulars of his life. 

<p>John "Mc Gourckey" died in November 1833. He was then 75 years old. The notice  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA276&lpg=PA276&dq=%22john+mc+gourkey%22&source=bl&ots=GuJd2pZFPK&sig=knk24ijRRSSosYCPLTn1R2NHjrU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BPImT-vDF6uB0QHXzY33CA&sqi=2&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20mc%20gourkey%22&f=false">said</a> he had taken an active part in the American Revolution and remained a man of high character throughout his life. The funeral was held three days later from his residence at Pearl and Fox Streets. His widow received a pension in 1838.</p>
