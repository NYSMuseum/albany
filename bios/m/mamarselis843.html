<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Marselis</b></a> was born in August 1735. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jomarselis733.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../b/anbeekman3879.html">Johanna Beekman</a> Marselis. Her father, an Albany alderman, died in 1746. She grew up in a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household that included several future Albany residents. In 1769, she was slated to receive a share of the estate in the <a href="../../wills/willanbeekman3879.html">will</a> filed by 
her widowed mother.</p>


<p>She married gunsmith <a href="../l/hrlansing3392.html">Henry R. Lansing</a> in September 1762. By 1770, five of her children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>In 1766, she was <a href="../../wills/willgemarselis711.html">left</a> a larger share of her brother's estate "for her extraordinary trouble more than the rest." In 1769, she was left a share of her parents' claim in the <a href="../../na/kayad.html">Kayaderosseras Patent</a>.</p>

<p>These Lansings lived on <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> where they were Albany mainstays for more than fifty years.</p>

<p>Henry Lansing died in 1819. A "Maria Lansing" was listed on the Albany census of 1820. However, no Lansings were listed at 444 South Market Street in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> for that year!</p>
