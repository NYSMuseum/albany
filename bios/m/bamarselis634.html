<P><a href="#sources"><b>Barbara Marselis</b></a> was born in September 1727. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jomarselis733.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../b/anbeekman3879.html">Joanna Beekman</a> Marselis. She grew up in a businessman's home located in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.</p>


<p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/barbogertea.jpg" align=right width=205 height=283 vspace=2 hspace=6 border=1 alt="Barbara Marselis Bogert - 1805"></a>In February 1758, Barbara was past her thirtieth birthday when she married a slightly younger carptenter-turned-skipper and and then surveyor named <a href="../b/hebogert6097.html">Hendrick Bogert</a>. By 1770, five of their children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a pewholder.

<p>In 1766, she was named in the <a href="../../wills/willgemarselis711.html">will</a> filed by her brother. In 1769, she was <a href="../../wills/willanbeekman3879.html">named</a> to share in the estate of her widowed mother.

<p>These Bogerts first lived near the <a href="../../loc/experiment.html">waterfront</a> in the <a href="../../census1790.html#6097">first ward</a> where Hendrick kept his sloop. Later, they would move to North Market Street.

<p>The <a href="#portrait">portrait</a> shown here was painted during the first part of the nineteenth century. 

<p>Barbara Marselis Bogert died in October 1816 at the age of eighty-eight. She was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Dutch church cemetery plot in Washington Park. Her husband lived for five more years.</p>
