<P><a href="#obit">Sub</a>sequent resources tell us that Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>George Monteith</strong></a> was born in <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>land in 1778. He came to America with his parents at the age of seven and lived in the city of Albany for the rest of his life. He was not the son of Albany resident <a href="pamont.html">Patrick Monteith</a> who died in 1795. Instead, his father is <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/monteath.html">said to have been</a> one Peter Monteath of Schenectady. The family name has been spelled <a href="../../res/sp.html">variously</a> in otherwise relevant historical records.

<p>In March 1804, George married Albany native <a href="../vw/havwie.html">Harriet Van Wie</a> at the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. The union is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=j-kpAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA424&lpg=PA424&dq=%22george+monteath%22&source=bl&ots=Nz2KefovCb&sig=XJoFAoITk3JD-kmQkhvPz8iAMcQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3xrX5rMDVAhVIyoMKHQ01BwoQ6AEITjAL#v=onepage&q=%22george%20monteath%22&f=false">said</a> to have produced eight children.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22george+monteith%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=monteith&f=false">1813</a>, he was listed in the first city directory as a <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">skipper</a> located at 80 Hudson Street. His mainline address and occupation appeared in that annual directory for many years.

<p>Perhaps he was one of the young men accounted for under his father's Southside household beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#8568">1800</a>. By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, Montieth's household was configured separately on the city census.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=albany+marine+bible+society&source=bl&ots=cPkSXDk7VU&sig=1Y6yv7HPxB9zOhVdoPh99oHXFCk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiHwqfFwcLVAhVEJCYKHTspD40Q6AEIQDAG#v=onepage&q=albany%20marine%20bible%20society&f=false">January 1823</a>, he was elected as a manager of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22albany+marine+bible+society%22&oq=%22albany+marine+bible+society%22&gs_l=psy-ab.3...6311.8006.0.8357.2.2.0.0.0.0.131.232.0j2.2.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0.bipTDW_fRsk">Albany Marine Bible Society</a>. By its third anniversary in that year, the organization appeared to be flourishing under the leadership of outstanding members of Albany's maritime community.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=4vRBAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA453&lpg=PA453&dq=%22george+montieth%22+albany&source=bl&ots=-3YBgqGVHM&sig=7Z5bd1so8735pqhdVG0LSRi4aPg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj1s9y_psDVAhUo8IMKHfRnCwMQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22george%20montieth%22%20albany&f=false">1826</a>, the State Comptroller's office approved the petition of George Montieth and others to incorporate the Albany Transportation Company.

<p>In February <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pykbAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=%22George+Monteith%22+albany&source=bl&ots=67Q8O2uHx3&sig=HF3YUEaGgo16hXabTdvEFf5FShw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMlZi23IvWAhUn2oMKHbTBBI84ChDoAQgzMAY#v=onepage&q=%22George%20Monteith%22%20albany&f=false">1831</a>, he was among the Albany skippers and "shippers of grain" petitioning the State Assembly for more shipping oversight.

<p>In March 1856, the Albany newspaper noted that George Monteith died at the age of 78. An <a href="#obit">obituary</a> outlined his long life.

<p>The Montieths of Albany, Oregon were Albany natives who <a href="http://albanyvisitors.com/historic-albany/museums/monteith-house/">named</a> their new town after the place of their birth.

George Monteath died, aged 78. He was born in the town of Dumblane, Scotland, in 1778, and came with his parents to Albany, at the age of seven, and resided here more than seventy years. He commenced the profession of a schipper on the Hudson river at the age of ten, and for more than thirty years was occupied in sailing sloops, much of the  time as master and owner. He was one of the founders of the Albany and Canal line of tow boats, with which he was actively connected until age and its infirmities compelled his retirement. Unlike  some of his fellow craft, he took advantage of the introduction of steam, instead of treating it with contempt, and acquired a fortune by it."</div>
