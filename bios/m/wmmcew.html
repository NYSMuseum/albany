<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Mc Cew</strong></a> probably was born during the 1730s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>William Mc Cew was a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> and an Albany resident as, during the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his 
<a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> house and property were accorded moderate assessments. A number of community-based documents (including a membership <a href="../../coerec1771.html#4394">list</a> from St. Peter's dated 1771) from the 1760s and early 70s referenced his house and his dependants. 

<p>In September 1758, he married <a href="../b/maburk4394.html">Mary Burk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as "of Albany." The marriage does not seem to have produced any children but the Mc Cews were <a href="../../wills/willwmmcew.html">raising</a> a young girl named Jenny and also employed apprentices and journeymen tailors.

<p>His marriage was tenuous as in September 1763 he posted a <a href="http://www.history.umd.edu/Faculty/CLyons/Hist%20210%20New%20York%20Run%20Away%20Wife%20Ads.pdf">notice</a> in the New York newspaper that his wife had eloped and that he would no longer be responsible for her debts. 

<p>However, Mary was identified as his principal heir and executor by the time a sickly William Mc Cew filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmmcew.html">will</a> early in September 1771. He was dead by September 24 when the will passed probate. Named in the will exclusively were local and New York business and craftsmen of <a href="../irish.html">Sc</a>ottish backgrounds.

<p>Following his passing, the widow Mc Cew carried on his tailoring business and was advertizing for workers in the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> in 1772. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> more definitive information on his <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.</p>
