      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Daniel Marshall</strong></a> was born in 
        February 1747. He was the son of <a href="pimarshall.html">Peter</a> and 
        <a href="../f/anflens8043.html">Anna Flensburgh</a> Marshall. He was a 
        middle child in the moderate-sized family of a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a> carman and Albany contractor.
		 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1770">1770</a>, he was named constable 
        for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. The next year his 
        account was paid from the city treasury. 
      <p>Still in his twenties at the outbreak of hostilities, we seek information on Marshall's wartime activies beyond simply contributing funds for firewood and the repair of the Albany barracks in 1776. Although, 
        he may have been the "Danial Merg" who was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#dm">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

      <p>His <a href="../../res/sp.html">wife</a> was <a href="../c/elcodman.html">Elizabeth Codman</a>. Between 
        1773 and 1788, five children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where both parents were occasional baptism sponsors. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#damar">1790</a>, his household included 
        eight members (five boys). A <a href="../../census1800.html#damar">decade 
        later</a>, he and Elizabeth shared the home with now five adolescent boys. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#dm">1788</a> and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, 
        his house and lot were valued modestly on Albany assessment rolls. However, we have not been able to fix his exact residence during those years.
		 
<p>During the mid-1790s, he was identified as one of the city <a href="../../org/cc.html#1795">watchmen</a>. 
      <p>After the census entry in 1800, the name of Daniel Marshall appears to have dropped from Albany rolls.</p>
