<strong>Pieter Marshall</strong></a> probably was born about 1720. We seek information on his background.


<p>In July 1743, he married Albany native <a href="../f/anflens8043.html">Anna Flensburgh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1755, six children had been christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>His name first appeared on Albany rolls in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1733">1733</a> when he was named constable for the second ward. We believe he was identified as a <a href="../../econ/trans.html#overland">carman</a> and listed as <a href="../../census1756.html#234">Pieter Marseille</a> on the census of city households taken by the British in 1756.

<p>During the 1760s and 70s, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was valued on city assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> . In 1767, he was listed as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In 1770, he was made a member of the Albany night watch. In 1773, he was paid for service to the city.

<p>He contributed a small sum for the relief of Ticonderoga in May 1775. However, his name does not appear on Revolutionary War-era rosters.

<p>After 1779, his name no longer appeared on Albany rolls. Perhaps he moved in with his sons who were living in Albany and Watervliet in 1790. 
 
<p>Pieter Marshall died in July 1795 and was buried from the church. His widow was among Albany's needy <a href="../../poor.html">poor</a> in 1800.</p>
