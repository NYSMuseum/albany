<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Muller</strong></a> was born in July 1721. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jamuller.html">Jacob</a> and Agnitie Muller. He grew up in a modest home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.


<p>By 1750, he had married Geertruy Goewey. Over the next two decades, at least seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents were occasional baptism sponsors at least into the mid-1770s. "Geertruy," the wife of Philip Muller, was identified as a pewholder in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA65&lpg=PA65&dq=%22philip+muller%22+albany&source=bl&ots=wxfC7Xvfjr&sig=jtYg2083BNl6czJI9g8DVEf9zKc&hl=en&ei=FrquTuKKA8Pb0QHP1f2RDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false">1759</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his third ward property was accorded a modest assessment. At the same time, he also held a house and property in the West <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>.
 
<p>A younger Philip Muller (perhaps Philip Jr.) appeared on the community landscape during the 1770s to <a href="../qqqq.html">complicate</a> the assignment of qualitative information. In his mid-fifties at the outbreak of hostilities, perhaps this individual was not the "Philip Miller" who received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>We move on still <a href="../qqqq.html">seeking</a> information on the later life and passing of Albany native Philip Muller.</p>
