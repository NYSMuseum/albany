<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously but distinguished here as "the elder," Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Mc Gourck</strong></a> was born in <a href="../irish.html">Ireland</a> in about 1752. We seek definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Our lack of certainty here, is inspired by the life of a <a href="jamgourck2.html">younger</a>, same-named contemporary.

<p>In his twenties at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, we expect to be able to connect him to wartime activities.

<p>In December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA260&dq=%22james+mcgurchy=onepage&q=james%20mcgurchy&f=false">1785</a>, his two separate accounts for "James McGur___y" were among those ordered paid by the Albany council.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October 1779</a> (but <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">not</a> in March), the property of "Jas McGourck" first was valued on the city assessment roll.

<p>Based on internal evidence, the elder James Mc Gourck was a resident of the second ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#15">1788</a>, the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> property of "James Mc Gurkey" was assessed modestly. At that time, one or more taxed individuals appear to have shared his home. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> and in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, his house and lot on Pearl Street and his personal property as well were valued moderately. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jamcgo">1790</a>, his household in the second ward was configured on the Albany census and included a man and two unspecified females. A decade later, his <a href="../../census1800.html#jamcgo">census</a> return showed a man over forty-five years of age, a girl, a woman, and two slaves living in his first ward household. At that time, younger, same-named <a href="jamgourck2.html">individual</a> appears to have been counted alone in a separate second ward household.

<p>In 1785, he was identified as an "original" member of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> Church. 

<p>In September <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=a-_fAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=%22james+mc+gourk%22+albany&source=bl&ots=uZUuH8SY8t&sig=m2Tm5cJZNYUIsRP4DBC8U9Su7Ro&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_7aUUsDpJ6PKsQSMooK4Bg&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22james%20mc%20gourk%22%20albany&f=false">1794</a>, meetings to organize Union College were held at "the house of James Mc Gourck in Albany." Perhaps this individual was the "James Mc Gouch" who 
<a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#jamg">pledged</a> eight pounds toward the establishment of the college in December of that year.   

<p>In October 1795, James Mc Gourck of the city of Albany recommended that a Herkimer County merchant be <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a>. The next year, his house was referenced in the newspaper as the staging point for <a href="../c/joclark7631.html">John Clark</a>'s mail service between Albany and Boston. 

<p>During the early 1800s, a James Mc Gourchy was identified as a grocer on community based documents. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a>, the name with the occupation of grocer appeared on a freeholder list. 


<p>The elder James Mc Gourck died in November 1804 at the age of fifty-two. He was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the First Presbyterian plot. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> a month later.

<p>At this point, we recognize that <a href="jamgourck2.html">two</a> same-named individuals were living in the city of Albany during the post-Revolutionary war era. This sketch represents our <a href="../../res/guess.html">first attempt</a> to distinguish them within the community context. With <a href="../qqqq.html">unresolved</a> issues, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
