<P>According to subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#wimu">doc</a>uments, <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Muir</strong></a> was born prior to 1756. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. A number of <a href="../../res/sp.html">similarly named</a> indivuals were his contemporaries. <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/cgi-bin/pageload.cgi?albany::muir::375.html">Per</a>haps, he was of <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish ancestry.

<p><a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary War <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_levies_albany.htm">service</a> information probably referencing more than one "William Muir" leads in several directions on both sides of the conflict. However, was he  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=b0LzQaB3ctAC&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227&dq=%22william+muer%22+albany&source=bl&ots=SK_LbUZ1op&sig=wuT9-WyvoJALlj9EdQnuq3AwpwA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=PAwNUsKUC9Wr4APuyYCwDg&ved=0CHIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22william%20muer%22%20albany&f=false">the</a> Patriot "William Muer" who received a <a href="../../cddc.html">pass</a> to go to White Creek in September 1778.

<p>His wife was Ann Morrison. Beginning in June 1788, the couple christened three children at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. Church records then called him a "fuller" and a merchant. However, their <a href="anmuir.html">daughter</a> probably was born much earlier.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#wimu">1790</a>, both "William Muer" and "William Muer, Jr." were listed as heads of households on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> with three and eight people in their respective households. In <a href="../../census1800.html#wimu">1800</a>, this individual's Watervliet household totalled eight members and a slave including two men and a woman who were at least forty-five years old.

<p>A city <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">map</a> dated 1792 noted the property of "William Muir" on the north side of upper State Street encompassing all the land between Lodge and Barrack Streets. At this point, that clear reference is <a href="../qqqq.html">puzzling</a> and stands alone.  

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward real property probably was unimproved and in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a>. 

<p>In May of 1802, he was among those elected <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=aJl4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA430-IA2&lpg=PA430-IA2&dq=william+muir+albany&source=bl&ots=k2tuigmpyP&sig=h1w1w4F-he8XatAQzpNtl3rYDCk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SMnBUZPUH-W8iwLNmoHYCQ&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=william%20muir%20&f=false">trustees</a> of the "Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church" which may have been an umbrella organization in the region.  

<p>William Muir was dead by June 1806 when letters of administration were issued on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a>. The first son of his <a href="anmuir.html">daughter</a> was named for him and was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1802.

<p>However, the actual/definitive identity of this particular indivdual remains uncertain. With relevant concerns still in <a href="../qqqq.html">quest</a>ion, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!
