<strong>Nicholas Marselis</strong></a> was born in May 1740. "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Claes</a>" was the son of <a href="gemarselis706.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../b/mgtbleecker211.html">Margarita Bleecker</a> Marselis. He grew up in a large family in the second ward home of an Albany shipper and <a href="../../corporation.html#council">co</a>uncilman.</P>

<p>In August 1766, he married <a href="../g/mgtgroesbeck3360.html">Margarita Groesbeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1786, that marriage had produced eight children who were christened in the Albany church.

<p>This Marselis family also made its home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Nicholas held a number of service positions beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a>. His accounts were paid from the city treasury.  In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#851">1767</a>, his name was on a roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.   

Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his modest second ward holdings were valued on city assessment rolls.

<p>In 1766, he was one of those who signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#851">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty.  A decade later, he was appointed captain of the <a href="http://www.fortklock.com/nymilitiaalbany1.htm">First Regiment</a> of the Albany militia and saw <a href="../../inprog.html">active duty</a>  during that time. In January 1778, he was elected to represent the second ward on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> of Correspondence. A few months later he signed a <a href="../../doc/petbenrogers.html">petition</a> for the release of a young prisoner. He also <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sno4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA373&lpg=PA373&dq=%22nicholas+marselis%22&source=web&ots=5XEQVdFpQ1&sig=6l1xuiZPv8AzlHyFthAJZypcM_Y#PPA370,M1">carried messages</a> to  Congress in Philadelphia in 1781. 

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#851">1779</a>, his lot (no personal property) in the second ward was valued moderately. Located nearby, were the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#211">holdings</a> of his widowed mother and brothers. 

<P>By 1790, Captain Nicholas Marselis was <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc10431.htm">living</a> in Rensselaersville. He probably was dead by 1803.</p>
