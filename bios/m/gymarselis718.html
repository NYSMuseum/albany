<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gysbert Marselis</b></a> was born in March 1724. He was the first child of the marriage of Albany businessman <a href="jomarselis733.html">Johannes Marselis</a> and his wife, <a href="../b/anbeekman3879.html">Anna Beekman</a> Marselis. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. His father died in 1746. His widowed mother did not re-marry and lived for several decades - perhaps into the 1780s.</p>


      <p>Gysbert married <a href="../w/cawendell2775.html">Catharina Wendell</a> 
        in November 1751. By 1767, the marriage produced at least seven children 
        who were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        where both parents were members and pewholders.</p>

<p>These Marselises also lived in the first ward where Gysbert was a noted Hudson River <a href="../../census1756.html#155">skipper</a>. He was a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1763fl">freeholder</a> and his property was accorded moderate assessments. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1749">1749</a>, he was appointed constable. In 1761, he was recommended for the office of sheriff but was not appointed. In 1766, he was <a href="../../wills/willgemarselis711.html">named</a> an heir and co-executor of the estate of his brother.
