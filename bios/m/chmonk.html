      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Christopher Monk</b></a> was born about 1768. We 
        seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and 
        path to Albany. Allowing for variable <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>ellings, 
        perhaps this individual had <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Henrich-Muenck/5204638326980021972">Ger</a>man 
        or New England (where a number of generations featured that name) roots.</p>
      <p>In 1790, the <a href="../../census1790.html#chmonk">census</a> showed 
        his family of six members was living in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>, 
        near the home of William Monk and probably in a location south of the 
        <a href="../../citylimits.html">city</a> of Albany.</p>
      <p>By 1810, he was married to Christiana Flagg of Schenectady and raising 
        a family that included seven children in an Albany household. A year later, 
        he was identified as a member of the First <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> 
        Church.</p>
      <p>From <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22monk+christopher%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22monk%20christopher%22&f=false">1813</a> until his death, he was listed in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city 
        directories</a> at various Albany <a href="../../streets.html">locations</a>. 
        Most of the time, he was identified as a cartman. For several years, he 
        lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pine">Pine Street</a> and upper Maiden 
        Lane. In 1820, his address on the "Southside" was given as "corner of 
        <a href="../../streets.html#green">Green</a> and Hamilton." 
		
<p>Christopher Monk died in September 1825 at the age of fifty-seven. He was characterized as "a very worthy citizen" and was buried from the Albany Lutheran Ebenezer Church. His widow lived on Pine Street for several years. His daughter <a href="samonk.html">Sarah</a> became the second wife of architect <a href="../h/phhooker.html">Philip Hooker</a> in 1814.</p>
