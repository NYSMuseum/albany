<P> <a href="#sources"><strong>Peter Mc Hench</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Mulhench) was born about 1753. He appears to have lived in Albany from the late 1770s until his death in 1822.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#mul">1779</a>, the name "Mulhench" first appeared on the city assessment roll. 

<p>After the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, a "William Mc Hench" was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#725">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment. We seek information on his wartime activities. Variable <a href="../../res/sp.html">name references</a> have made that difficult. 

<p>In February 1785, his account for just under four pounds was paid from the city treasury. In 1791, he was listed as a fireman.

<p>In May 1786, he married Agnes or <a href="../b/naboyd.html">Nancy Boyd</a> in Albany. The marriage is said to have produced five children. At least two of them were   christened at the  <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a> where, in 1794, he was ordained a deacon. In 1820, he was elected a church elder.

<p>He was a carpenter and also a businessman (unless the merchant was a different Peter M.) probably in partnership with the Boyds.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#pmch">1788</a>, his personal property was valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll under the house of Thomas Mulhance. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward house and property were accorded modest assessments.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#pmch">1790</a>, his second ward household was configured on the census. A decade later, his <a href="../../census1800.html#pmch">household</a> was in the first ward and included three children.

<p>Beginning with the first issue in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22m'hench+peter%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22m'hench%20peter%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a> and listed in the directory at what became 26 <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl Street</a>. Maps located <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">him</a> on the northeastern side the intersection with Hudson Street which also was the address of "Boyd and Mc Hench," merchants. Additional Mc Hench family members also lived at that address during and after Peter Sr's. lifetime. 
  
<p>Peter Mc Hench died in October 1822. He was buried in the United Presbyterian Church cemetery plot. His son, William, carried on at the family home while his widow <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BkxmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA422&lpg=PA422&dq=%22peter+mchench%22&source=bl&ots=l-E3hShDf1&sig=qH6c3F_-YpvMHk2ve7QgFlIMXxU&hl=en&ei=zeMgTOm-HsL_lge26aw1&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20mchench%22&f=false">survived</a> until 1851.</p>
