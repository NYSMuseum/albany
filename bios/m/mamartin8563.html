<strong>Margaret Martin</strong></a> (sometimes called Elizabeth <a hreef="../../res/sp.html">or</a> May Elizabeth) was born in March 1754. She was the daughter of Peter and Elizabeth Burns Martin.

<p>In August 1776, she married Albany native <a href="../h/johooghkerk3600.html">Johannes Hooghkerk</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the next decade, five children were christened in the Albany church.

<p>This Hooghkerk family made its home in the first ward where Johannes went from Revolutionary militia officer to tailor with the end of the war. In 1784, their house was on the corner opposite the Presbyteran Meeting House at <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">Pearl</a> and Beaver.

<p>Margaret Martin Hooghkerk became widow a when her thirty-eight year-old husband died in March 1785. Her last child was christened in April with the "father dec'd."

<p>In 1788, she probably was the "Widow Hooghkerk" whose <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house and property were valued on the city <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8563">assessment roll</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, she may have resided in <a href="../../census1790.html#3583">one</a> of the two Hoogkerk-named households listed on the Albany census. In <a href="../../census1800.html#8563">1800</a>, however, she was named head of a first ward household that included her and a younger couple only. From the beginning in 1813, the home of "Widow Margaret Hooghkirk" was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 37 <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver</a> Street. In 1830, no Hooghkerk was listed in the directory at that address.

<p>Margaret, was referred to as the "widow of John Hooghkerk" when she was buried from the  Dutch church in November 1835 at the age of eighty-two.</p>
