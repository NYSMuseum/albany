<strong>Isabella Mills</strong></a> probably was born during the 1760s. We seek information on her background and earlier life.

<p>In July 1788, she married <a href="../c/jocam7513.html">John Cammeron</a> at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. At that time, both partners were  "of Albany." Over the next decade, their children were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In that year, the Cammerons  began to appear on Albany rolls when his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7513">personal property</a> was valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> assessment. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7513">1790</a>, their household included but three members. Probably not owning their own home, nonethless, in 1800, the <a href="../../census1800.html#7513">census</a> showed a man and woman born after 1756 and three small children.

During the 1790s, Cammeron was known as a painter and as the city watchman. 

<p>After 1800, the household of John and Isabella Mills Cammeron no longer appeared onAlbany rolls.</p>
