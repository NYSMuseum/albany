<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Muller</strong></a> was born in March 1731. He was the son of <a href="jamuller.html">Jacob</a> and Agnes [Conyn] Muller. He was the youngest child in a large <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> family. His father was in his forties at the time of the subject's birth but Jacob Muller would live into the 1760s.

<p>In June 1753, Johannes married <a href="../vi/savi2485.html">Sara Van Iveren</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, church records identified the partners as living in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. By 1778, nine children had been christened in the Albany church.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#59">1756</A>, the name of "Joannis Miller" a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">weaver</a> appeared on an inventory of Albany buildings taken by the British army. Later that year, "Joh's Muller" was <a href="../../org/cc.html#1756">named</a> constable for the third ward.

<p>From that point on, the life history of Johannes Muller becomes <a href="../qqqq.html">complicated</a> by the existence of a number of similarly named John Miller/Mullers living in greater Albany County.

<p>With many <a href="../../res/guess.html">possibilities</a> for the remainder of the eighteenth century and yet little defining information, we must move on for now.

<p>Johannes Muller would have been 69 years old in 1800.</p>
