<P>Spelled <a href="../../res/sp.html">and</a> referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Stephense Muller</strong></a> was living in Greenbush in 1663. He is <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/m/c/a/Al-Mcanespy/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0178.html">said</a> to have been born in Nykerk, Holland in 1648 (<a href="../../res/guess.html">?</a>). He also was known as "Mulder."

<p>He is said to have settled at <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> about 1660. Before long, he owned property in what became Albany, a farmstead in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>, and, in 1718, is said to have obtained a thousand acres at Claverack from <a href="../vr/hvr5053.html">Hendrick Van Rensselaer</a>. However, his interest and activities at Claverack can be traced back to <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA357&lpg=PA357&dq=%22cornelis+stevensen+mulder%22&source=bl&ots=9O6ZGZdDYD&sig=-kzP1UvaxpR9qcd-vxXAT8nrP5g&hl=en&ei=XlmtTrCeEePr0gGJ_dSADw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20stevensen%20mulder%22&f=false">1677</a>.

<p>His wife was <a href="../l/hiloock5935.html">Hilletie Lookermans</a>. By 1700, eleven <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2000-08/0966186630">children</a> had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> with a number of prominent community members as their sponsors. He was a member of the Albany church from at least 1683.


<p>In 1689, his name was included on a <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#csm">list</a> of farmers in the company (Catskill?) of Gerrit Teunisse (Van Vechten?). In <a href="../../census1697.html#csm">1697</a>, his household in Rensselaerswyck included nine children. Because he mostly was not a city resident, we have not actively pursued the <a href="../../na/na.html">out-of-Albany</a> aspects of his life.

<p>By 1720, he had settled permanently on his Claverack property which, by that time, appears to have been under the control of his son Stephen. Cornelis Stephense's Albany holdings on Broadway and Maiden Lane went to his sons <a href="jamuller.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="jomuller483.html">Johannes</a> who became city residents.

<p><a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer Cornelis Stephense Muller is <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/m/c/a/Al-Mcanespy/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0178.html">said</a> to have been buried on the his son's Claverack farm.</p>
