<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>John Maley</strong></a> was born in Alcase, France in 1743. He emigrated to New York about 1766 and entered the import business. 


<p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/jomaley.jpg" align=left vspace=4 hspace=4 width=150 border=1 alt="John Maley by Ezra Ames to be added"></a> Within a few years, he had married <a href="../t/catremper.html">Christina or Catherine Tremper</a>. Their <a href="hamaley.html">daughter</a> was <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part5.html">baptized</a> in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in November 1769. John remained an Albany church member for the remainder of his life.

<p>By that time, these Maleys had become residents of Albany. In October 1773, John Maley gave <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA253&lpg=PA253&dq=%22john+maley%22+alcase&source=web&ots=wwgC8Wvbkz&sig=PWQm0pgX6tNbAw7lhwpYt_yI3ME&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result">testimony</a> about his background before the Albany city council, stated that he had paid Albany taxes for the last five years, and that he had voted in years passed. 

<p>From the start of hostilities in 1775, he lent financial support to the American <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">cause</a>. In November 1779, he marched with the city militia under <a href="../d/isdef4726.html">Isaac De Foreest</a> to Stone Arabia. Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1058">1779</a>, his Albany property was valued on city assessment rolls.  In 1781, he was one of a number of newcomers who purchased the <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">Freedom</a> of Albany. At that time, he was identified as a merchant. Maley's associate was <a href="../c/jocuyler586.html">Johannes Cuyler</a> who later would marry Hannah Maley. 

<p>During the 1780s, he was able to acquire hundreds of acres of newly available lands in the central and western parts of New York State from Revolutionary War <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">soldiers</a>.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#1058">1790</a>, he had settled into a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1058">large house</a> on North <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a>. His holdings included a store, stables, and storehouses spread over several urban lots. His household and enterprises were serviced by a number of slaves. Maley's landmark property was lost when an important section of the core part of the city was destroyed by the <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html">fire</a> of 1793. It was said that he lost property worth over $250,000 in the fire. By <a href="../../census1800.html#1058">1800</a>, he seems to have rebuilt at that location.

<p>A pillar of the Albany business community for several decades, he was one of the first directors of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a> which was located next door to Maley's Market Street home. He also had a country seat located in what is today's Loudonville.


<p>John Maley died in November 1811. As his wife probably had passed on, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">L</a>etters of administration were granted to his daughter and her husband on his estate in June 1812.</p>
