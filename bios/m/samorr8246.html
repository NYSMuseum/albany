      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Morrell</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">M</a>orrill) was born in December 1748. He was the third surviving son of Daniel and Alida Dox Morrell. His <a href="http://www.morrillonline.com/html/MorrellDaniel-1711-x.html">parents</a> had come from Newtown, Long Island to settle in Albany County where most of their children were born.
	  
	  <p>In March 1772, he married <a href="../g/ragard.html">Rachel Gardenier</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as "young people of this county." By 1791, nine children had been christened in Albany where he was an occasional baptism sponsor. By <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, three sons had become heads of households in the city of Albany.
	  
<p>Twenty-seven at the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">outbreak</a> of hostilities, we expect to find information on his wartime activities. Afterwards, he <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8246">did qualify</a> for a land bounty right under the Albany militia regiment. 	  
	  
<p>In March 1786, he was paid from the city treasury. In November he was appointed chimney viewer.  
	  
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8246">1788</a>, his personal property was configured under the third ward house of <a href="../vv/gevvr.html">Gerrit Van Vranken</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8246">1790</a>, he was listed as the head of a nine-member household  on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census.	  
	  
	  
      <p>Samuel Morrell died in February 1795. "Mrs. Morril's husband" was buried on February 17. In <a href="../../census1800.html#rag">1800</a>, his widow was listed as head of a third ward household. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, the addresses of his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22morrel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22morrel%22&f=false">widow</a> and two sons were listed in the first city directory.</p>
