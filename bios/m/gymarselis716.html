<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gysbert Marselis</b></a> probably was born about 1660s. He was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="../vb/marjansvb.html">Marselis Jans</a> and <a href="../g/angerr6012.html">Anna Gerritse</a>. He was known by the surname <a href="marselis.html">Marselis</a>.

<p>He was one of five children noted in the <a href="../../wills/willmarjansvb.html">will</a> filed by his father in June 1690.


<p>By 1683, he had married <a href="../g/bargroesbeck3262.html">Barbara Groesbeck</a>. Over the next two decades, their eight children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member, frequent baptism sponsor, and one-time churchmaster.</p>

<p>Nominally a shoemaker, he set up his shop in his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where he served as constable, assessor, and juror. By <a href="../../census1697.html#112">1697</a>, he was a rising merchant and his <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#716">landmark</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1711">1711</a>, he was chosen assistant alderman for the second ward and served for several years. He also served in an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#716">company</a> of the county <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> in 1715.</p>

<p>In September 1716, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willgeercoey.html">will</a> of his neighbor, the widow <a href="../c/geercoey241.html">Geertie Ten Eyck</a>.

     <p>Although still a prominent resident, after <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#716">1720</a>, 
        he seems to have retired from public life. 

<p>Gysbert Marselis died in June 1740 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
