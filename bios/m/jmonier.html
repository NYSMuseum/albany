<strong>John Monier</strong></a> came to America with the British army during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Great War for Empire</a>. 

<p>This French-ancestry opportunist married Albany native <a href="../s/masharp.html">Mary Sharp</a> in 1763. Although their long-term marriage produced no children, shortly thereafter the couple settled into a <a href="#lot">new house</a> on the hill along the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">King's Highway</a>.</P>

<p>Monier prospered in the Albany setting although his fortune was dependent 
            on the provincial government and a dwindling number of royal adherents. 
            <a href="#signature"><img SRC="../../images/jpg/sig/sigjmonier.jpg" ALT="signature of John Monier" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4 BORDER=0  width=195 height=80  align=LEFT></a>By 
            1769, he had been appointed to replace <a href="../vs/hvschaack.html">Henry Van Schaack</a> as postmaster at Albany. Using his position to carve out a conductive role in colonial commerce by serving <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> and 
            other frontier developers, Monier was able to acquire <a href="#land">wilderness land</a> on his own behalf. He began to trade in logs and lumber and 
            also kept boarders at his Albany home. From his earliest days in the 
            community, he was a prominent member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
            Peters</a> Anglican church.</p>  

<p>However, the American Revolution ruined all of his budding enterprises. Monier managed to avoid trouble until May <a href="../../or/or-be.html">1776</a> when he confessed to being a "King's officer." He was clapped in the Tory jail and then sent under guard to Hartford, Connecticut. A year later, he had returned to Albany. But upon declining to take an oath of allegiance, he was ordered to the fleet prison in Kingston. Claiming that he was ill, Monier was allowed to convalesce in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. Later, he was sent to the British in New York City. By the end of the war, he was lobbying the royal governor for permission to take his family to England or Canada - stating that he had served the king faithfully for twenty-four years and had suffered irreparable losses. 

<p>Although he was an overt Loyalist, Monier managed to survive the struggle and even to return to Albany. He <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jm">had a house </a> in the second ward and opened a lumberyard on the <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a> property that he found had not been confiscated. The Albany census in <a href="../../census1790.html#monier">1790</a> placed his residence in the first ward and showed it housed one man and one woman. Although he never regained his pre-war status, he sawed, seasoned, and shipped lumber until he died. But a decade later, his widow was on the city <a href="../../poor.html">poor roll</a>.</P>

<strong>Sources:</strong> 
The life of John Monier is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1636. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from  <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a> nd from the <a href="../../sources.html#jp">published papers</a> of Sir William Johnson. We seek more definitive information on his origins and passing.</p>

<p><a name=signature></a><b>Signature</b> of John Monier on a letter to <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
            Johnson</a> in December 1773 covering bills for the shipment of Windsor 
            chairs and an organ. Facsimile printed in the introduction to volume 
            8 of the <a href="../../sources.html#jp"><i>Johnson Papers</i></a>. 
            Monier regularly procured and stored goods, handled monies, arranged 
            for a range of services, and also used the post office on Johnson’s 
            behalf. Sir William’s death in 1774 ended an advantageous patron-client 
            relationship and signalled the beginning of the erosion of Monier's 
            position in Albany.</p>
 
          <p><a name=lot></a><b>Albany property:</b> In September 1765, Monier leased a 
            one acre <b>lot</b> on the north Side of Lion Street from the city 
            of Albany. His house and lumber yard were located on that property. 
            However, those locations do not appear on the <a href="../../map/mapdewitt.html">city 
            maps</a> made by Simeon De Witt during the 1790s.</p>

<p><a name=land></a><b>Wilderness land:</b> In 1767, he received 6,000 acres on the east side of the Hudson opposite Fort Miller. However, his petition of 1772 to have the patent erected into the "township" of West Camden went unfulfilled.</p>
