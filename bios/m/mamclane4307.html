      <P>According to her <a href="https://albanychurchgrounds.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/featured-gravestone-thomas-mary-diamond/">tombstone</a>, 
        <a href="#sources"><b>Mary Mc Lane</b></a> was born about 1738. We seek 
        defining information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. Her <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> was referenced 
        variously in contemporary records.</p>
      <p>She was the wife of <a href="../d/thsdiamond.html">Thomas Smith Diamond</a> 
        - who probably settled in Albany prior to the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>. 
        In 1776 <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part6.html">and</a> 
        1779, the couple witnessed baptisms at the Albany Dutch<a href="../../drc.html"> 
        church</a>. The marriage would produce a number of children (at least 
        three) who married Albany natives. These "Diamond" parents were members 
        of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>.</p>
      <p>These Diamonds lived in the first ward along <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson 
        Street</a> where Thomas owned a modest <a href="../../census1790.html#7872">home</a>. 
      <p>Thomas Smith Diamond died in 1796. His <a href="../../wills/willthsdiamond.html">will</a> 
        specified "wife" (not named) as co-executor. Their son <a href="../d/wmdiamond7873.html">William</a> 
        became a city resident although she was not listed with him on the census 
        in <a href="../../census1800.html#7873">1800</a>. 
      <p> The widow Mary Mc Lane Diamond <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22diamond%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=diamond&f=false">lived</a> 
        in a house at 109 <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius Street</a> 
        until her death in December 1817. She was <a href="https://albanychurchgrounds.wordpress.com/2012/01/11/featured-gravestone-thomas-mary-diamond/">buried</a> 
        in the Presbyterian cemetery plot. Her will passed probate in December 
        of that year. During the 1860s, her <a href="../../dead.html">remains</a> 
        were among those removed to the <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural 
        Cemetery</a>.</p>
