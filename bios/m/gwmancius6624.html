<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>George W. Mancius</strong></a> was born in December 1767. He was the eldest son of <a href="wilman.html">Wilhelmus</a> and <a href="../t/ante4838.html">Anna Ten Eyck</a> Mancius. He grew up in a large family in the Market Street home of a prominent Albany physician. He was named for his paternal grandfather, a well-known Kingston cleric.

<p>In <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york/military-minutes-of-the-council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york-1783-18-2nu/page-31-military-minutes-of-the-council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york-1783-18-2nu.shtml">1798</a>, he was appointed   surgeon for an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment - replacing his father's partner, <a href="../w/hunwood.html">Hunloke Woodruff</a>.

<p>His wife was named Catherine. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IyDQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA460&lpg=PA460&dq=%22catherine+mancius%22&source=bl&ots=9P1HZCXnmr&sig=lUokxuaBq1_DXunIorSz9TZlC3E&hl=en&ei=ERfUS4jxCY-49gSq362uDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22catherine%20mancius%22&f=false">Perhaps</a> she was the daughter of <a href="../vd/javdh5691.html">Ja</a>cob Vanderheyden. Curiously, no mention of his marriage has been found in the extant <a href="../../drc.html#sources">records</a> of the Albany Dutch church.

<p>His father was the Albany <a href="../../org/po.html">postmaster</a> until his death in 1808. Wilhelmus was succeeded by his son <a href="jacman.html">Jacob</a> as postmaster and then by George who served until he was replaced by <a href="../d/pedox571.html">Peter P. Dox</a> in 1814.  

<p>George W. Mancius was known as merchant and his house and lot in the second ward were valued substantially on the assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>. Also in that year, he owned "land" in the second ward. Over the years, he bought and sold properties in a number of locations within the city. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6624">1800</a>, his first ward household included only a boy and two slaves besides a young couple.

<p>In December 1804, he and his wife were among those who swore that they had witnessed the signing of the will of General <a href="../s/phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a>.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=%22mancius+george%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22mancius%20george%22&f=false">1813</a>, his residence at 22 <a href="../../streets.html#montgomery">Montgomery Street</a> and the Post Office (at 10 Court and then 436 South Market) were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a>. At that time, his widowed mother and two brothers also were listed on Market Street.

<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, the census showed his household with only an older couple and a slightly younger woman. 

<p>George W. Mancius "Esq." died in December 1823 at the age of fifty-six. Letters of administration were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">issued</a> on his estate the following January.</p>
