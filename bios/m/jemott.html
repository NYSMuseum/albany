<P>One-time Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jesse Mott</strong></a> was born during the 1770s. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In June 1798, Jesse Mott married Sarah Forman at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In January 1810, "Mrs. Sarah Mott" was <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/albany_ny_1st_presby.htm">identified</a> as a member of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">P</a>resbyterina church.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#jemo">1800</a>, his household in the first ward included two young men, two girls, and a woman under twenty-five years of age.

<p>Between 1806 and 1812, a Jesse Mott <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165&dq=%22jesse+mott%22+albany&source=bl&ots=RibqGdqbab&sig=NPGpYTRsjkG1HyJG6jdRJ7ZCzVI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9o4eUZGzL42i8ASHo4AY&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22jesse%20mott%22%20albany&f=false">represented</a> Saratoga County in the New York State Assembly. That individual also served as Saratoga supervisor. 

<p>Not encountering the subject of this sketch for those years in the <a href="../../cbr.html">Albany-based record</a>, perhaps he had moved north - at <a href="../../res/guess.html">least</a> for a time.

<p>However, in 1816, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> listed a Jesse Mott as a merchant-tailor located at 61 <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Washington</a> Avenue. Other Motts were listed in previous and subsequent directories. But none were named Jesse and were not at his previous address.

<p>Otherwise he has not yet been encountered in our sweeps of <a href="../../cbr.html">community</a> and <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a> based resources. 

<p>With many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding the life of one-time Albany resident Jesse Mott still unanswered, we move on for <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">now</a>.</p>
