<P><a href="#sources"><b>Henry Milton</b></a> is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~coleharbour/Milton/">born</a> in November 1760. He was the son of <a href="hmilton2004.html">Henry Milton</a> and his second wife, <a href="../n/ranorton2021.html">Rachel Norton</a> Milton.</p>

<p>He <a href="../../res/guess.html">pr</a>obably grew up on his father's East Manor <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farm. During the Revolution, he was listed on the roster of the sixth regiment of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany County militia</a>.</p>


<p>About 1781, he may have married Rhoda Wickwire. That marriage produced eight children. In 1790, he probably was living in his <a href="../../census1790.html#2004">father's</a> third ward house. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2005">1800</a>, the couple, another man (could be Henry Sr.), and one child were living separately in the same location. At that time, he also owned or leased a lot on <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick Street</a>. </p>

<p>He was raised in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and several of his children were buried there. In December 1806, his his child was buried "gratis!" In 1814 and 1815, a Henry Milton was listed in the Albany city directories as a laborer living at 86 Fox Street.</p>
