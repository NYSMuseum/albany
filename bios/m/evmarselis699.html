      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Eva Marselis</strong></a> was christened 
        on January 1, 1726. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jomarselis733.html">Johannes</a> 
        and <a href="../b/anbeekman3879.html">Johanna Beekman</a> Marselis. Their 
        <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home included several future 
        Albany residents. Her father died in 1746 but her mother appears to have 
        survived at least into the 1760s. 
      <p>Her husband was <a href="../r/joroseboom1927.html">Johannes M. Roseboom</a>. 
        The marriage appears to have been childless. However, she was a contributor 
        to and an occasional baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>.
      <p> 
      <p>Without children of their own, these Rosebooms may have <a href="../../census1756.html#238">lived</a> 
        with family members until Johannes was identified as a householder on 
        city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> from 
        the 1760s and '70s. 
      <p>In 1766, she was named in the <a href="../../wills/willgemarselis711.html">will</a> 
        filed by her brother. In 1769, she was <a href="../../wills/willanbeekman3879.html">named</a> 
        to share in the estate of her widowed mother. 
      <p>Johannes Mynders and Eva <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1927">lived</a> 
        in a comfortable house near the river until April 1783 when Roseboom died 
        from "a stone" according to his friend, <a href="../w/ewesterlo.html">Domine 
        Westerlo</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#699">1788</a>, widow Eva was 
        listed as the owner of the house in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#699">1790</a>, her household 
        was tended by three slaves. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1800</a>, 
        she was alone in the house with two slaves and an unrelated free person. 
        In 1804, she promised to free her <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slave</a> 
        "Peter" upon her death. By March 31, 1811, Peter had been freed. 
      <p>Widow Eva Marselis Roseboom probably was dead by or before 1810.</p>
