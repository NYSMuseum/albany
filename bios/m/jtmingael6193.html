<P>According to family based resources, <a href="#sources"><strong>Jan Thomase Mingael</strong></a> was born during the second half of the seventeenth century. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="tjmingael6189.html">Thomas Janse</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdu5552.html">Maritie Van Deusen</a> Mingael.

<p>About 1683, he married Maycke Oothoudt. That marriage appears to have been childless and she died before too long. By 1703, he had married Maria Van Deusen. By 1714, four children of the second marriage had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a lifetime member and frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>For more than five decades, Jan Thomase was an Albany mainstay. After some <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#6193">time</a> in the first ward, he lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where, beginning in 1688, he was <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">elected</a> assistant alderman for many years. He also served on juries and was the captain of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company in <a href="../../lists/list1715jmc.html">1715</a>. In 1702, he first was elected alderman and served several terms.. His <a href="../../census1697.html#075">landmark house</a> on Maiden Lane and Middle Alley (James Street) was accorded substantial assessments on the Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6193">tax rolls</a> and he held several lots in the city which he bought and sold on an active <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6193">1699</a> and several times afterward, he joined with his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. 

<p>He filed a will in August 1729 naming his wife as his sole heir. Jan Thomase Mingael died in April 1731 and was buried beneath his church. With his passing, the name "Mingael" dropped from Albany annals.</p>
