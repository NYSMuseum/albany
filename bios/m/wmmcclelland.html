      <P>According to his obituary, <a href="#sources"><b>William Mc Clelland</b></a> 
        was born in Galloway, Scotland in 1768. He was educated at "Endinburgh" 
        and came to America at an early age!</p>
      <p>After 1796, he married the young widow <a href="../h/anhoffman.html">Annatie 
        Hoffman Ten Eyck</a>. He was a member and trustee of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
        church where their child, "Genet," was baptized in November 1798.</p>
      <p>He was a <a href="../../trades/medical.html">physician</a> and was active 
        in Albany medical circles. A medical colleague called him "a practical 
        Scot." He was a member of the Albany County and New York State Medical 
        Societies. He was president of the Albany St. Andrew's Society. He taught 
        medical students and was associated with a number of area physicians including 
        newly arrived <a href="../b/wmbay.html">William Bay</a>, who, by 1810, 
        was Mc Clelland's junior partner. </p>
      <p>In 1799, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property appeared 
        on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#wmcl">1800</a>, 
        his household included four children under ten, two males and three females 
        (perhaps including his wife) 16-24, no women older than that, and three 
        slaves. By 1810, the <a href="../../census.html#1800">census</a> identified 
        three free persons of color instead of slaves in his household.</p>
      <p>Crippled by sickness, Dr. William Mc Clelland died in January 1812 at 
        the age of forty-three. He was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in 
        the Presbyterian cemetery plot. Bay carried on his practice for many years. 
        The <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> for 1813 listed 
        Mc Clelland's widow across town at 16 <a href="../../streets.html#tromp">Van Tromp</a> 
        Street.</p>
