<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"><strong>Thomas Janse Mingael</strong></a> was <a href="#born">born</a> during the first part of the seventeenth century. He is said to have been the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer Jan Thomase. As he married twice, at this point, we are uncertain about the identity of his mother. Those parents lived in New Amsterdam. Jan Thomase was dead by 1642 when his widow <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22had+the+paternal+estate+settled+upon+her+children%22&source=bl&ots=I7pobNy2Ku&sig=KDhOqNYtQKWkh7CLihilQi7-jwQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7KZPT5KUHabq0gG2_qmADg&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22had%20the%20paternal%20estate%20settled%20upon%20her%20children%22&f=false">"</a>had the paternal estate settled upon her children."

<p>Perhaps by 1650, Thomas Janse had married "<a href="../vd/mavdu5552.html">Maria Abrahams</a>" [Van Deusen or Witbeck but not Vosburgh]. His marriage to Maria Abrahams produced several children who raised families in the colony. These Mingaels settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he was among those who took part in the initial distribution of <a href="../../lists/list1650s.html#l">houselots</a> during the early 1650s. His <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA201&lpg=PA201&dq=%22thomas+janse+mingael%22&source=bl&ots=-Zu4E-EVax&sig=Wy4QZIlZq3Q1me_xTKkSGy4PlZU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DrBPT-OXGIXY0QHCxrnjDQ&ved=0CB4Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20janse%20mingael%22&f=false">house</a> was said to have been on the west side of what became <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>.

<p>He was <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been a carpenter and householder who appeared before the town <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">court</a> during the 1650s in different capacities. His name does not appear on either list of significant fur traders who petitioned the court in <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">1660</a>. He also is said to have purchased a yacht called "The Flower of Gilder." 

<p>Beverwyck resident Thomas Janse Mingael was dead by 1662. A year later, his widow <a href="../w/evwendell2655.html">re-married</a>. 

<p>We are left with many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding the life of this individual. The core identity of his wife is among the most often mis-represented of them! </p>
