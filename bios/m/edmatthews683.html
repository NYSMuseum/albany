<P>This <a href="#sources"><strong>Edmund Matthews</strong></a> probably was not the son named "Edmund" who <a href="#should">should</a> have been but was not mentioned in the will filed by garrison officer and Albany resident <a href="pematthews.html">Peter Matthews</a> in 1717. In 1721, Peter Matthews's  widow <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x7EFAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0RqEpnydb3S0U8r0kR&lr=#PPA244,M1">identified</a> her only son as <a href="vimatthews.html">Vincent</a>. The subject of this sketch probably was a grandson or other member of that soldier family.

<p>This Edmund Matthews too was an army officer who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YAMKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA735&lpg=PA735&dq">served</a> in the so-called <a href="../../7yw.html">Gr</a>eat War for Empire.  In 1755, a Captain Edmund Matthews was the commanding officer of "new levies" at Albany. Later that year, he was referred to a "Major" and in garrison at Fort Edward and Fort William Henry. In June 1756, Major Edmund Matthews reportedly was "mobbed and beaten" in Albany.

<p>Edmund Matthews married a woman named <a href="../b/mabrooks.html">Mary Brooks</a> in February 1760. At that time, he was identified as an Albany County farmer. In July of 1766, he posted a notice in the New York City newspaper that he would not pay the debts contracted by his wife Mary in the future. 

<p>During the 1760s, he also was an Albany resident whose <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> substantially (comparable to that of active merchants) in 1766 and 1767.
 

<p>Edmund Matthews of Albany died <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">intestate</a>. In September 1771, letters of administration were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cFIOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA462&dq=abstracts+of+wills+1899#PPA463,M1">issued</a> to Joseph Griswold.

The life of Edmund Matthews is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 683. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. During the late 1750s, an <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/pa/1pa/military/french/pass2-14.txt">ensign</a> Edmund Matthews was operating in the Susquehanna Country.
<p><a name=should>"Should:" The point here is that the subject of this potentially puzzling sketch was not the son of Peter and Bridget Matthews. Any clarifications would be most appreciated!
