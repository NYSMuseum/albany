<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Mingael</strong></a> is said to have been born during the early 1660s. Perhaps he was the last child born to the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New         Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="tjmingael6189.html">Thomas Janse</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdu5552.html">Maria Abrahams</a> Van Deusen Mingael. He was baptized in New Amsterdam. His father was dead by 1662 when his mother re-married. His step-father was widower <a href="../w/evwendell2655.html">Evert Janse Wendell</a>, a long-lived pillar of early Albany.
		
<p>In November 1685, Pieter married <a href="../r/mgtroseboom1939.html">Margarita Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where 
        he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor. The marriage probably 
        was childless as no children were christened in Albany. 
      <p>Mingael's home was in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> 
        where he served as assessor (four different years during the 1690s), juror, 
        and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In <a href="../../census1697.html#151">1697</a>, 
        he and his wife were alone in their home. Two years later, he signed a 
        community-based <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6195">oath</a> swearing 
        allegiance to the king of England. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, 
        his property was accorded a substantial assessment. 

<p>Pieter Mingael may have died after he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sdQUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA158&lpg=PA158&dq=%22pieter+mingael%22&source=bl&ots=BVYmNQXgZ6&sig=x1v7KMh3Xz5C1p1h5qFJSWVrh2I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pv3FT4fHE-f16AHwtfGpBg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22pieter%20mingael%22&f=false">wit</a>nessed a baptism in August 1704. His widow was listed as the head of their second ward household in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1939">1709</a>. Without visible offspring, the "Mingael" name appears to have dropped from Albany rolls following her passing. </p>
