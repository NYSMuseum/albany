<P><a href="#sources"><b>Peter Matthews</b></a> was an officer in the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> at Albany during the second decade of the eighteenth century. He may have been in New York in the early 1690s as a ship captain. <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=dwarnerla&id=I7460">Perhaps</a> he was the nephew of Governor Benjamin Fltetcher and accompanied him to America in 1692. By 1697, he was on garrison duty in New York City. In June 1709, he witnessed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x7EFAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0RqEpnydb3S0U8r0kR&lr=#PPA75,M1">will</a> in New York.</p>

Several of their <a href="#children">children</a> established themselves in provincial society. </p>


<p>Later in 1709, he was a captain in a company serving on the expedition against Canada. By 1714, he had settled in Albany but retained his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=98k6AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&ots=EgY1veA1QT&focus=viewport&dq=%22peter+mathews%22#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20mathews%22&f=false">command</a>. He was an officer and supporter of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. He was instrumental in its establishment - brokering the transfer of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tu1BAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA2087&lpg=PA2087&dq=%22peter+mathews%22+patent&source=bl&ots=PE3ekyIuB7&sig=FJTmKeMhQatxJXjNCj_INitbCQg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MUz_U8ukKK7JsQT92YGIBA&ved=0CCAQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22peter%20mathews%22%20patent&f=false">title</a> to land literally on State Street.</p>

<p>During those years (beginning in 1703), he was a partner in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bP43AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22wawayanda+patent%22+matthews&source=bl&ots=GKk8iiVszh&sig=6bPRQMbnqX4tzlVofPGX53_stDg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dU3_U567IO_IsASL3ILwAQ&ved=0CEsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22wawayanda%20patent%22%20matthews&f=false">con</a>troversial <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N9E4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22wawayanda+patent%22+matthews&source=bl&ots=8Yb0H99pTe&sig=XgotdfTPSn2JDG_kt-GNWjjLPpk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dU3_U567IO_IsASL3ILwAQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22wawayanda%20patent%22%20matthews&f=false">Wawaywanda Patent</a> for <a href="http://www.albertwisnerlibrary.org/Factsandhistory/History/EarlyDaysinWarwick.htm">lands</a> located in today's Orange County that were later developed by his son <a href="vimatthews.html">Vincent</a>.</p>


      <p> In 1715, he was appointed to the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of 
        Indian Affairs</a> - a responsibility often bestowed on the commander 
        of the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> at Albany. </p>

<p>Calling himself "Colonel," he filed a <a href="#will">will</a> in May 1717. It stated that he was a resident of the "city of Albany." The will passed probate on June 27, 1719. His widow moved to New York where she filed her own <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=x7EFAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0RqEpnydb3S0U8r0kR&lr=#PPA244,M1">will</a> in 1721.
