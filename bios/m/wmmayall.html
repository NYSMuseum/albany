<strong>William Mayall</strong></a> is said to have been born in London about 1772. 

<p>On June 15, 1795, an Albany newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Gp0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA172&lpg=PA172&dq=%22william+mayell%22+london&source=bl&ots=Yoh41s_1T3&sig=_9uEgINJiik17eKMebo40ZdoFsA&hl=en&ei=I1GsSfXxFaXKM8zKpOsE&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result#PPA172,M1">announced</a> that "William Mayell, hatter, from London, had just opened, for sale, at the store of T. Fradgley, No. 3 Market street, a general assortment of men's, women's and children's fashionable hats, various colors." Mayall would settle into the community and remain an Albany mainstay for the remainder of his life - a span of almost sixty years. 

<p>We seek information on his spouse, his family, and possible church affiliations.

<p>From the first directory in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, he was identified as a hatter at <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA79,M1">84</a> Court Street (later 510 and 534 South Market). By 1819, the name of William Mayell, Jr., also a hatter and at 446 South Market, began to be listed in the directory as well. Also by then, his name appeared as a member, officer, and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Op9IAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA4&dq=mayell+wendell#PPA101,M1">contributor</a> of a number of community-based organizations including being the treasurer of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany Insititute</a> of History and Art. By the 1820s, he was being elected and/or approinted to city government-related offices.  

<p>However, his name does not seem to appear on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">Alb</a>any census or on city assessment rolls for the 1790s or early 1800s. Perhaps he resided beyond the <a href="../../criteria.html">city limits</a> and rented business and manufacturing spaces along <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a>.   

<p>He may have been the William Mayell of Albany who was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=j_66Mg0yr8IC&pg=PA95&lpg=PA95&dq=%22william+mayell%22+albany&source=bl&ots=757G7yvZDN&sig=Y0Sff983RLUE-oyqmF6FtaVVrLA&hl=en&ei=VUqtSbnAB4jTnQe2va3CBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result">associated</a> with the "Eastern New York Anti-slavery Society" in 1845.
  
<p>William Mayall died in May 1855 at the age of eighty-three. A newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dqhttp://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22william+may-ell%22:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA327,M1">obituary</a> summarized his long life.
