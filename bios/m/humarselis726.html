<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Huybertje Marselis</B></A> probably was born during the 1650s or early 1660s. She was the daughter of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> pioneers <a href="../vb/marjansvb.html">Marselis Janse</a> and <a href="../g/angerr6012.html">Anna Gerrits</a>. Her family later took the surname "<a href="marselis.html">Marselis</a>." Her tavernkeeper father also was able to acquire substantial real property and holdings in Albany and its hinterland. Except for a <a href="ahmarselis623.html">brother</a> who later moved to Schenectady, Huybertie's surviving siblings would become her Albany neighbors.</P>

<p>Over the winter of 1675-76, Huybertie Marselis was the subject of a lengthy <a href="#court">court case</a> regarding the <a href="humarselis726preg.html">paternity and support</a> of her child. In April 1676, the Albany court ordered <a href="../b/jhbruyn7464.html">Jan Hendrickse Bruyn</a> to pay her a large sum as it found "it a matter of no small consequence to seduce a young girl in one's own house." At that time, she was in her mid-teens. </p>

<p>However, all was not lost as by the early 1680s, she had met and married <a href="../y/joyates4419.html">Joseph Yates</a>, an <a href="../../census1697.html#042">Eng</a>land-born garrison soldier. Still a young woman, their marriage produced nine children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Huybertie was a member. Joseph Yates settled in Albany where he supported his family as a blacksmith, contractor, and carter.

<p>In June 1690, she was one of five children noted in the <a href="../../wills/willmarjansvb.html">will</a> filed by her father. However, no mention was made of her husband but her unnamed children were referenced as contingent heirs.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#042">1697</a>, their household consisted of the parents and six children. A decade later, the "Yeats" home within the soldier <a href="../../loc/southside.html">enclave</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#4419">assessed</a> modestly. A number of their <a href="../y/yates.html">children</a> would become prominent Albany residents.

<p>One-time soldier Joseph Yates passed on in May 1730. Huybertie Marselis Yates died two months later and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Dutch Church cemetery. She was the matriarch of the Albany Yates family although she lived for less than sixty years.</P>
