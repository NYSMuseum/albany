<P><a href="#sources">Tradition</a> holds that <a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Marselis</b></a> was a colonist on Staten Island during the first half of the seventeenth century. By mid-century, he had married <a href="../vd/cavdb5739.html">Catharina Vandenbugh</a> - the mother of several Marselis daughters. By the mid-1650s, his family had settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he had purchased a houselot.</p>


<p>In 1673, he was living "behind Kinderhook" near the farm of his son-in-law, Mathias Hooghteeling. A decade later Marselis was identified as a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and later was reimbursed for contract services and for the maintenance of the poor. However, his name was absent from Albany survey documents during the 1670s and 80s. In 1697, he was identified as the city porter.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#021">1697</a>, he was living alone in a first ward home. By the end of the year, he was dead. As only daughters raised families, his line was extinguished with his passing!</p>
