<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>John Miller</strong></a> (1666-1724) graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 
          1684. In 1692, he was appointed chaplain of the New York Companies, 
          received his ecclesiastical license from the Bishop of London, and, 
          by that October, had landed in New York. For the next three years, Miller 
          was the sole Anglican cleric in New York. He served at the English forts 
          on Manhattan and in <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">Albany</a> and 
          preached at the other English outposts as well.</p>

<p>John Miller was a keen observer of the late seventeenth century New York scene - describing and reflecting on what he saw in what became a considerable collection of notes and drawings. In 1696, Miller left the colony to return to England. However, his ship was captured by a French privateer - but not before Miller threw overboard his papers to prevent their capture by the enemy. Miller was incarcerated and used the time to re-write and further develop his accounts of his New York experience. Redeemed, he was returned to England in 1696.</p>

<p>Serving the remainder of his life as the vicar of Effingham, Miller was called a "worthy and respectable vicar" and "a man of research." On his death in 1724, an inventory of his estate revealed an extensive library - with many of the volumes annotated by Miller, as well as a number of original manuscripts.</p>

      <p>One of those works (taking the form of an extended letter to the Bishop 
        of London) has been preserved in the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British 
        Museum</a>. It was printed several times over the next two centuries. 
        The best-known and most accessible version is entitled New<i> York Considered 
        and Improved, 1695</i> by John Miller ("published from the original MS. 
        in the British Museum"), was edited by Victor Hugo Paltsits, and published 
        by The Burrows Brothers Company of Cleveland in 1903. With its <a href="../../art/miller.html">descriptive 
        text</a>, analyses, and annotated maps and diagrams, that work represents 
        a major historical and ethnographic resource for the history of New York 
        during the 1690s. Included in that volume are John Miller's <a href="../../im/immiller.html">map 
        of Albany</a> and his <a href="../../images/jpg/ftmillerplan300.jpg">diagram 
        of the fort</a>. They are among the most often seen visual representations 
        of early Albany.</p>
