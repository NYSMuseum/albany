<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Marselis</b></a> was born in May 1695. He was a son in the large Albany family of <a href="gymarselis716.html">Gysbert</a> and <a href="../g/bargroesbeck3262.html">Barbara Groesbeck</a> Marselis. A one-time shoemaker, his father became a prominent businessman and community leader.</p>

<p>In July 1723, he married <a href="../b/anbeekman3879.html">Anna (Johanna) Beekman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where their eight children were baptized between 1724 and 1742.</p>

<p>Johannes or John came of age during the decades of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> beginning in 1713. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#733">1715</a>, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. Following his marriage, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where these Marselises set up their home. Johannes seems to have followed his father in business. He was elected alderman for the first ward four times beginning in 1740.

<p>Johannes Marselis died in January 1746 - a few months shy of his fifty-first birthday. His widow lived in their Albany home for many years.</p>
