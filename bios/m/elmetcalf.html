<P>According to family-based <a href="http://moneymaker.rootsweb.ancestry.com/surnames/coleman/fam02176.htm">sources</a>, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Elizabeth Metcalf</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Metcalfe) was born in northern New York (Missisquoi) in 1776. She was the daughter of <a href="simetcalf.html">Simon</a> and <a href="cametcalf.html">Catherine</a> Metcalf of Yorkshire, England  who had emigrated to New York about 1766. Her father was able to secure title to a tract in the northern woods and they probably were living there when Elizabeth was born. 

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#sm">1790</a>, her adventurer/trader father had moved the family to Allbany where they were living when he left on business and then lost his life in the Pacific Northwest in 1794. Her widowed mother's third ward household was included on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1800.html#camur">1800</a>.


<p>In June 1799, "Betsey Metcalf" <a href="http://boards.ancestry.myfamily.com/surnames.bleecker/24/mb.ashx">married</a> Albany native <a href="../b/hebleecker187.html">Henry Bleecker</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1813, six children were christened in Albany. Her brother, <a href="geomet.html">George</a>, had moved to Albany in 1798 to take a position in the State Attorney General's office.

<p>These Bleeckers <a href="../../census1800.html#187">lived</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> from where Henry was a merchant for several decades.

<p>Their son, George Metcalf Bleecker, was born in Albany in 1806 and became a prominent attorney and district attorney of Staten Island.

<p>Henry Bleecker died in November 1837. Elizabeth Metcalf Bleecker is said to have died in Albany in January 1872.
