<strong>John G. Marselis</strong></a> was born in September 1734. He was the son of Albany residents Gerrit and Margarita Bleecker Marselis. He grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html"#2">second ward</a>. 

<p>He does not apprear to have married but was a pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a> and again in 1763, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the second ward. In 1766, he probably was among those who <a href="../../solconst.html#738">signed</a> a constitution for the Albany Sons of Liberty. In 1767, he was listed on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>The existence of a same-named and contemporary <a href="jomarselis736.html">kinsman</a> prevents assignment of much of a substantial body of life information at this time. Thus, this sketch strives to rely on material associated with "John G. Marselis." On a number of occasions, his second ward holdings were valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#738">1788</a>, he appears to have been living in the house of his widowed mother. But in <a href="../../census1790.html#738">1790</a>, the second ward household of "John G. Merseilus" included two men, five women, and a slave. The <a href="../../census1790.html#736">household</a> of his cousin also appeared on the census

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, a lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> belonged to John G. and his brother, <a href="gymarselis720.html">Gysbert Marselis</a>. 
 
<p>John G. Marselis died in April 1803 and was buried from his church.</p>
