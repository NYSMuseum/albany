<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Mahar</strong></a> lived in Albany from at least 1788 until 1810. Subsequent records show that he was born prior to 1756.

<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>At this point, we have not been able to answer <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities.

<p>We expect that he was married but have not found marriage or childbearing information in the extant records of the major early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wmma">1788</a>, the assessment roll valued the house and property of "William Meaghher" moderately and located it on a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> street.
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#wmma">1790</a>, the first United States census configured the household of Willam Mahar in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. A decade later, the <a href="../../census1800.html#wmma">census</a> showed the Mahar household with two adolescent boys and an aging couple. The assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> placed his house and personal property in about the same location and valued Mahar's holdings moderately.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, a much younger "Wm Mahar" was identified on the city census. Perhaps that individual <a href="../../presbyterian.html">ma</a>rried in 1807. Three Mahars (but not either William) were listed in the first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA87&dq=%22maher%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22maher%22&f=false">1813</a>. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> defining information on the later life and passing of this one-time Albany resident.</p>
