<P><a href="#sources"><b>William Mc Intosh</b></a> was came to Albany during the middle of the eighteenth century. By <a href="../../census1756.html#189">1756</a>, he had settled into a southside home where he was identified as a "<a href="../../trades/hatter.html">hatter</a>."</p>


<p>By 1755, he had married Albany native <a href="../k/gekid5983.html">Geertruy Kidney</a>. Over the next two decades, five of their children had been baptized in <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>.</p>

<p>During the 1760s, he settled into a mainline Albany life. He served as a constable in the first ward for three years; was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>; was paid by the city government for services; and was among those who <a href="../../solconst.html#1114">signed</a> a "Sons of Liberty" constitution in 1766. He also seemed to have been associated with merchant <a href="../s/rosanders1443.html">Robert Sanders</a>.

<p>After 1776, his name dropped from Albany rolls. Was he dead or was he the same William Mc Intosh who died in 1805 and was buried "gratis" from the Albany Dutch church?</p>
