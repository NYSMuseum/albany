<P>In 1771, <a href="#sources"><b>Simon Myer</b></a> or <a href="../../res/sp.html">possibly</a> "Seymour Johnson Meyers"  rented business space in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> Albany establishment of <a href="../h/bhilton.html">Benjamin Hilton</a>. Meyers advertized fabrics, spoons, Maieira, Tea, vinegar, and spices for sale in the short-lived <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. 

<p>In 1766, an individual listed simply (no first name or additional information) as "Myers" owned a house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> and was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">taxed</a> at the minimum rate of one pound. Beyond that, he has not been referenced in our ongoing sweep of the <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based record</a>.

<P><a href="http://www.civilwarsignals.org/1st/myer/myerancestors.pdf">Perhaps</a> this Albany resident had been born in New York City in December 1749 and had married <a href="http://www.thornfamily.net/williamthorne1/d3310.htm">Cornelia Thorn</a> of Dutchess County in August 1774. By that time </p>

<p>In 1770, Simon was identified as one of the three sons of Andrew Myer, Jr. and his wife, Susanna, in the will of another family member.  </p>

<p>In 1775, he may have been living in Northeast precinct, Dutchess County. He may have served in the Revolutionary army from Dutchess County.

<p>This individual had only a brief <a href="../../criteria.html">residence</a> in pre-<a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> Albany.  We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany, later life, and <a href="../../res/death.html">p</a>assing. In other words, who was "Seymour Johnson Meyers" who was doing business in Albany in 1771<a href="../qqqq.html">?</a></p>
