<P>The name "<a href="#sources"><strong>Alexander Mc Lean</strong></a>" or Mc <a href="../../res/sp.html">C</a>lean is encountered in a number of interesting contexts during the second half of the eighteenth century. We are uncertain as to how many different same-named individuals the following notes describe.

<p>One Alexander McLean was <a href="http://www.conovergenealogy.com/conover-p/p1510.htm#i313341">born</a> in Scotland in 1731 or '32. His wife was Annie Laing. Their son was christened in Albany in 1758.

<p>One of these characters lived for a time in mid-eighteenth century Albany. In July <a href="../../census1756.html#270">1756</a>, "Fisher & Mc Clean" were listed on a census of Albany householders and identified as merchants. This profile seeks to comprehend the life of that <a href="../../criteria.html">individual</a>. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=%22alexander+mclean%22+albany&sig=yAHD3gSFErbMfuI6riy94bz0Llw&ct=result&id=hQm3_i12zAUC&ots=hOq-Dckxqs&output=html">1758</a>, Alexander Mc Lean was selling uniform accessories in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../doc/olivebranch1770.html#amclean">1770</a>, he shipped thirty bunches of onions out of Albany for sale in the West Indies.

<p><a href="http://history.rays-place.com/ny/ren-lansingburgh.htm">1770 or '71 </a>, he was one of a number of area men who purchased newly partitioned property at <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>.

<p>In 1775, his name was on a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FHo4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA832&lpg=PA832&dq=%22alexander+mclean%22+albany&source=web&ots=-dqQ9xeHuv&sig=jl9N1eIVvixLaO0_Mg_udQE3LG0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result">list of insolvent debtors</a> in New York City.

<P>In June 1778, a individual of that name brought useful <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LwnYfKaK4ksC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=%22alexander+mclean%22+albany&source=web&ots=IRyA-wPpYX&sig=McNvhQNvNmvJAjwQy47xmMrMrgg&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result#PPA157,M1">information</a> to the attention of the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>.

<p>In 1785, the St. Andrews Society <a href="http://www.bklyn-genealogy-info.com/Society/1785.St.Andrew.Bio.html">listed</a> McLEAN,  CAPTAIN  ALEXANDER as #74 and an early member: 
      Captain McLean kept a general store in Albany, New York, "living
between the English and Dutch Churches a little below the main guard, in the
Main street." He traded between New York and Ireland in the snow <i>Charming Nancy</i> and became a member of the Marine Society in 1781.

<p><a href="http://www.nbgs.ca/firstfamilies/FAMILY-McA-McY-2006.pdf">Another</a> same-named individual was among those on a <a href="http://missingpearsons.tripod.com/banta.htm">long list</a> of New Yorkers who left the city for Nova Scotia in 1783. He is said to have died there in 1801.
