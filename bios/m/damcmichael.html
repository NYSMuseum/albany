<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously (aka Mc Master), Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Daniel Mc Michael</strong></a> was born during the first decades (probably during the 1720s) of the eighteenth century. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In June 1748, he is said to have married <a href="samarselis.html">Sara Marselis</a> at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. Their children mostly were christened at that church between 1749 and 1758. However, a son was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in June 1752. Some of them would become residents of Schenectady.

<p>In April <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=%22dan'l+mac+michael%22&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22dan'l%20mac%20michael%22&f=false">1749</a>, he ("Dan'l Mac Michael") was permitted to take over property previously held by Isaac Van Valkenburgh on a twenty year lease. For more than a decade following, the city records chronicle related transactions.

<p>Daniel Mc Michael died during the 1760s. In September <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=and+the+widow+of+daniel+mc+michael&source=bl&ots=wyhLbUv9ex&sig=X0GHaqMJ0TbRAOhgwWIBImUJvDE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiyvaOrrMjJAhXEkh4KHdLMAtUQ6AEIOzAE#v=onepage&q=and%20the%20widow%20of%20daniel%20mc%20michael&f=false">1767</a>, the name "Widow of Daniel McMichael" was included on a list of those who owed rent money to the city of Albany. Assessment rolls for those years also included her among those taxed.

<p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA213&lpg=PA213&dq=%22sara+mcmichal&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22sara%20mcmichal&f=false">April 1770</a>, city council <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">minutes</a> noted that Daniel was dead yet still indebted to Albany. However, his agreement for the house and land on the "<a href="../../loc/ver.html">Verrybergh</a>" would be extended to his widow, "Sara MacMichal," for the next twenty-one years.

<p>After that, Daniel Mc Michael was no longer referenced in the community-based record until the city assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, valued the first ward house and lot of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Daniel Mc Michael, Jr. </p>
