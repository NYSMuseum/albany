<P>According <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=88759242">to</a> family-based resources, Albany wife <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Muir</strong></a> was born in March 1781. She was the daughter <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/MUIR/2001-01/0980470210">of</a> recently arrived Watervliet <a href="../../census1790.html#wimu">residents</a> <a href="wmmuir.html">William</a> and Anne Morrison Muir.  


<p>Her husband was <a href="../o/jojostr.html">John J. Ostrander, Jr.</a>. Notwithstanding the presumed birth date given above, in 1788 and 1792, her children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. In July 1800, their daughter was christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. Regular subsequent <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=pete_witze&id=I32797">births</a> were recorded for the couple until 1830. Perhaps two same-named individuals have been compressed into one in the family-based record. 

<p>Her husband was an attorney and notable Albany resident until he <a href="../../or/pension/penjoostjr.html">re-located</a> to Onondaga County during the early 1830s. Ostrander died in Tully in 1849.

<p>Anna Muir Ostrander died in August 1865 and was buried with her husband in the cemetery in Tully. </p>
