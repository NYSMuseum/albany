<P>A <a href="#sources"><b>George Mc Elcheran</b></a> was born about 1763.</p>


<p> In 1788, <a href="#identity">George Mc Elcheran</a> began advertizing imported goods for sale at his store in Bennington, Vermont. In 1790, George Mc Elcheran's household consisting of two men and a woman was included on the federal <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> for the town of Bennington. Later that year, his name appeared on a Bennington freeman's list. </p>

<p>In March 1787, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> reported that he ran a school in Albany known as the Washington Academy and that it was located at "Northgate."
 
<p>In 1789, George Mc Elcheran married <a href="../b/caburgiss2048.html">Catherine Burgiss</a> at Albany's <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> church. During that time, at least two children were baptized in Albany area churches. In 1793, St. Peter's rector <a href="../e/tellison.html">Thomas Ellison</a> testified to "Mc Elicheron's" character and conduct while stating that he had left Albany.</p>

<p>By 1799, George Mc Elcheran was back in Albany and the owner of a modest house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Barrack Street</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In 1800, his second ward household including four children was enumerated on the Albany census. In 1801, he paid twelve dollars for a license to run a tavern. He owned another small lot on Lion Street. By 1813, he had sold both these properties.</p>

<p>The 1820 <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a> for the city of Albany, listed George Mc Elcheran as a merchant at 10 Washington Avenue.</p>


<p> <a href="#book"><img src="../../images/jpg/arithmetic1805.jpg" align=right width=190 alt="Title Page from Mc Elcheran's Arithmetic" hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1></a>Among other things, George Mc Elcheran was an educator. In 1805, an Albany printer issued his <i>Preparatory Introduction to Arithmetic</i> - a dictionary and directory of mathmatical terms. A decade later, he was associated with the newly opened 
<a href="http://www.albany-academy.org/history/his_history.html">Albany Academy</a>. City directories for 1821 and '22 identify him as the "principal col" of the Academy located at 10 Washington Avenue.</p>


<p>George Mc Elcheran died in December 1831 at age sixty-eight. The Albany death notice called him a schoolteacher.</p>

<p>At this point, we are <a href="#identity">not at all certain</a> that all of the abovementioned information pertains to a single individual! </p>
