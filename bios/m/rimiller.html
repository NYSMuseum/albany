<P><A href="#biography"><B>Richard Miller</B></A> was <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County from 1749 to 1754.</P>


          <P>Miller's origins remain unknown. He was associated with the British 
            army and seems to have been a trader based in New York City. <a href="#receipt"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigrimiller.jpg" align=right width=225 vspace=4 alt="Miller's signature in Captain Winne's receipt book" border=0></a> 
            His business brought him to Albany and to the attention of <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
            Johnson</a>. His wife's name was Elizabeth. Their daughter was baptized 
            at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in September 
            1736.</P>

<p>In 1749, Miller was appointed sheriff of Albany city and county. He  was <a href="#rec">recommended</a> by Johnson with whom he had a business relationship. </p>

<p>Richard Miller died intestate early in 1762. In March, Letters of Administration were issued to his widow and son-in-law. He was called "Lieutenant" and a member of "His Majesty's Independent Companies."</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The career of sheriff <B>Richard Miller</B> 
            is important to the early Albany story. Because he was not really 
            a resident of the city, he has not been assigned a CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography 
            number</A>. This profile is derived chiefly from provincial and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
            resources</a>.</p>

<p><a name=rec></a>In September 1749, Johnson's highly letter to the governor called Lieutenant Miller a long time acquaintance who would "make as good a Sheriff as ever was in Albany." He also reminded the governor that Miller then was living in New York. Printed in <a href="../../sources.html#jp">JP</a> 9:51-52.</p>
