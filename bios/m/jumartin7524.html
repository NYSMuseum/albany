<strong>Judith Martin</strong></a> probably was born about 1710. She is said to have been born in Albany and may have been the daughter of <a href="pamartin.html">Pat</a>rick and Mary Martin. We seek information on her background.

<p>In November 1733, she married Albany native <a href="../h/jahilton7523.html">Jacobus Hilton</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1755, ten children had been christened in the church where she was a frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>Judith raised her family in a wampum maker's <a href="../../census1756.html#177">home</a> on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> of Albany. Their row house was located nearby those of other Hilton families. 

<P>Judith buried her husband in December of 1763 leaving the aging widow in charge of their holdings and the rearing of her remaining children - the youngest of whom were scarcely ten.  Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> rolls from the 1760s and '70s  valued her middling <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings. In March 1779, she was <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7524">identified</a> as the "Widow of Jacob Hilton". Her two adult sons were living in her home at that time. 

<p>Judith Martin Hilton probably died during the 1780s as her name no longer appeared on Albany rolls while her sons William and <a href="../h/jahilton.html">Jacob</a> remained in the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8036"> family home</a>.</p>
