<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anne Macomb</strong></a> was born within a few years of 1750 ( perhaps in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=9t4XAQAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA113&lpg=RA1-PA113&dq=%22thomas+bennett%22++macomb&source=bl&ots=PZd4f4QI_Q&sig=nyWlE7t6qmrXLFVZTm9XwZU1xnI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2CH_VOauK7OAsQSOvoDgAg&ved=0CDkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20bennett%22%20%20macomb&f=false">1753</a>). She was the daughter of <a href="jomacomb.html">John</a> and Jane Gordon Macomb of Northern <a href="../irish.html">Ire</a>land. She is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have accompanied her father and brothers to America in 1757 - although she may have stayed behind with her mother and emigrated afterwards. Her mother does not seem to have come to America. John Macomb soon settled in Albany where Anne and her brothers probably grew up.

<p>By 1770, she seems to have married <a href="../p/frpf.html">Francis Pfister</a>, a German-born British army engineer who had served on the frontier at least during the 1760s. Pfister was in Albany in <a href="../../org/masonic.html">1768</a>, and became a <a href="../../nat.html">naturalized</a> British subject in 1772 - the same year he retired from the Army.

      <p>In March 1772, Pfister probably was married to Anne when he was identified 
        as a tenant in an Albany house. Shortly thereafter, he relocated to his 
        property at Hoosick where Anne would raise their children. She soon was 
        joined by her aging father. 
      <p>The war caused this extended family great hardship culminating in the death of Francis Pfister at the so-called Battle of Bennington in August 1777. Widow Anne then came under the protection of her father who took her to Detroit where she married one Captain Thomas Bennett in 1782. In two marriages she was the mother of at least eight children. 

<p>Anne Macomb Pfister Bennett is said to have died in 1820. We seek particulars regarding her later life and passing.</p>
