<P><a href="#sources"><b>Wilhelmus Mancius</b></a> was born in September 1738. He was the first child born to German-ancestry, Dutch Reformed Domine George W. and Cornelia Kierstede Mancius of Kingston.</p>

<p>During the early 1760s, he came to Albany on business. His name appeared on a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html">petition</a> from Albany merchants in 1764. Early in 1766, he joined other Albany men in <a href="../../solconst.html#6628">signing a document</a> protesting the Stamp Act. His <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> house was included on the city assessment roll later in the year.</p>

<p>In December 1766, he married Albany native <a href="../t/ante4838.html">Anna Ten Eyck</a>. By 1784, their eight children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were pewholders.</p>

<p>Initially a merchant, notary, and contractor of the city, by the outbreak of the Revolution he was handling medical supplies and accompanied the militia as a "doctor" in 1776.</p>  

<p>Reputedly trained by his father, Mancius became a <a href="../../trades/medical.html">physician</a> in Albany who also sold medicines and medical supplies. He later became the partner of newcomer Dr. <a href="../w/hunwood.html">Hunloke Woodruff</a>. They became pillars of the post-war Albany medical community - training physicians and serving as officers of the Albany County Medical Society.</p> 

<p>In March 1788, he joined with other Albany antifederalists in publishing a <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#6628">list</a> of their objections to the proposed constitution.

In 1795, a back room served as the Albany <a href="../../org/po.html">Post Office</a> with his son, <a href="jacman.html">Jacob</a>, as postmaster. twenty-nine-year-old Jacob was shown on the census in his father's house in <a href="../../census1800.html#6828">1800</a>. Jacob then was succeeded in the post office by his older brother <a href="gwmancius6624.html">George W. Mancius</a>.</p>

<p>Affable and eccentric, uniquely talented Wilhelmus Mancius died in October 1808 at the age of seventy. His widow and children inhabited the "Mancius house" for many years.</p>
