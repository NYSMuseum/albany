      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Marselis, Jr.</strong></a> was born 
        in December 1727. He was the son of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        residents Myndert and Feytie Oothout Marselis. He probably was called 
        John Jr. to prevent confusion with his <a href="jomarselis733.html">uncle</a> 
        and later with <a href="jomarselis738.html">John G. Marselis</a>. This 
        sketch strives to reconstruct his life story accurately by relying on 
        information related to the Albany resident known mostly as "John Marselis, Jr." 
		
<p>About 1755, he married <a href="../g/corngardinier.html">Neeltie Gardinier</a>. 
        By 1762, three children reflecting the distinctive names of the grandparents had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        He <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/johannes_marselis_records.ashx?pid=33872184">may</a> have re-married in 1770 and may 
        have fathered more children. 
      <p>John Marselis, Jr. lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">As</a>sessment rolls from 1779 
        on valued his shop and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl</a> 
        Street. Perhaps he was the Albany silversmith who had <a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">ma</a>rried 
        Margarita Vandenbergh in 1770. We believe that he was among the Albany 
        traders who <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#736">petitioned</a> the 
        royal government in 1764. 
      <p>Except for one <a href="../../coc.html">account</a> for services in 1775, 
        his name seems to be absent from the records of <a href="../../or/or.html">wartime</a> 
        Albany. But a "John Marselis Jr. was named on the <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#736">roster</a> 
        of mostly Albany men serving under the Quartermaster General in August 
        1778. That individual was called "Issuer of Wood and Clerk to B. M. Genl." 
      </p>
      During the 1780s, he was involved in a number of community-based activities 
      including heading a group of sixty-four petitioners who asked for <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden 
      Lane</a> to be extended through the <a href="../../stpeters.html">Episcopal 
      burying ground</a> in February 1786. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#736">1790</a>, his home included three 
        females. His household was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#736">1800</a>. 
        John Marselis, Jr. was last heard from in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1800c">1802</a>. He is <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/johannes_marselis_records.ashx?pid=33872184">said</a> to have died on April 25, 1803. We seek more definitive information his passing.</p>
