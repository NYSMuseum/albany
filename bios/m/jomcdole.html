<P>Known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously (Mc Dowell or even John Dole), Albany resident <a href="#sources">
<strong>John Mc Dole</strong></a> probably was born about 1750.

<p>In August 1772, he married "Catherine Clerk" (possibly a daughter of <a href="../c/pclark7635.html">Patrick Clark</a>) at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. His marriage(s) produced some children apparently over a long period of <a href="../../census1800.html#jomcd">time</a>. His family received services in both St. Peter's and in the <a href="../../drc.html">D</a>utch church.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jomcd">1779</a>, his house and property first appeared on an Albany assessment roll.

<p>In August 1779, he was brought before the <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners on Conspiracies</a> and accused of harboring an escaped prisoner. He denied the charge and was released on good behavior until the State government re-convened. However, a year later, he was accused of aiding escapees fleeing to Canada. Again, he was examined but released. We seek to account for his wartime <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">activities</a> more closely.
 

<p>In 1788, perhaps he owed money to the <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#jomcd">estate</a> of his neighbor, the late Dr. Henry Van Dyck.  In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jomcd">1788</a> and in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home and holdings were valued on the assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#jomcd">1790</a>, his household included a boy and five females. A <a href="../../census1800.html#jomcd">decade later</a>, the Mc Dole household included a boy and two small girls.

<p>In March <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, a jury list identified him as a "gentleman." 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=52+Liberty+M'Dowle+albany&source=bl&ots=2hKtH-1y4z&sig=pxyhFuIYXxwdSetF3EYcA3WlPoY&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result">1813</a> and afterwards, city directories listed his residence as 52 Liberty Street - a location on a new street parallel to and west of South Market Street.

<p>John Mc Dole died in November 1821 and was buried from his Liberty Street home. By that time, several "Mc Dowall" named households were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> His will passed probate in January 1822.
