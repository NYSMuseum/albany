<strong>Elizabeth Mumford</strong></a> was born about 1752. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> defining information on her origins and early life.

<p>In May 1780, she was identified as a spinster when New York State granted a marriage license for her and <a href="../e/abellison7943.html">Abraham Ellison</a>. She may have been his second wife.

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#7943">1790</a>, these Elllisons were living in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> in  household that included a man and four females. Ellison was a bookseller who owned a modest place on lower State Street where he was living by <a href="../../census1800.html#7943">1800</a> when his household included seven members. 

<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, Ellison had passed on and Elizabeth was identified as the head of their household that consisted of four children, an older male, and two older women. Beginning with he first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&q=ellison#PPA64,M1">1813</a>,  she was identifed as the widow Elizabeth Ellison and living at 34 <a href="../../streets.html#montgomery">M</a>ontgomery Street.

<p>Elizabeth Mumford Ellison died in January 1831. Her Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#deathinfo">newspaper</a> obituary noted she was seventy-nine and the widow of Abraham Ellison the bookseller. </p>
