<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled <a href="#name">var</a>iously, <a href="#sources"><strong>Francis March</strong></a> was a prominent member of the <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro-Albanian</a> community throughout the first third of the nineteenth century.
 
<p>This individual probably was born during the early 1770s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and early life.

<p>By March 14, 1795, he had married Sarah, the slave of <a href="../w/elkwatson.html">Elkanah Watson</a> who freed her on that date and <a href="../../res/realestate.html#sources">granted</a> her husband Sarah's power of attorney.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#1024">1800</a>, the household of "Francis March, a free negro," was enumerated on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. At that time, two "other" free persons were the only souls living in his home. Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1820</a>, subsequent censuses place him with the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a>. In 1820, his household counted three free [white] males of varying ages and one male free person [of color] aged 26-44. So, perhaps the latter householder was Francis March within that age range.

<p>Beginning in 1809, he acquired lots in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of Albany.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=%22march+francis%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22march%20francis%22&f=false">1813</a>, he was listed in the city directory as a skipper with an address of 217 Washington then South Pearl Street. In 1815, his name was among those <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">italicized</a> denoting that he was a "free person of color." Subsequent editions <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?db=biodat&rank=1&new=1&so=3&MSAV=1&msT=1&gss=ms_db&gsfn=francis&gsln=march&msrpn__ftp=albany&dbOnly=_F0002899%7C_F0002899_x&dbOnly=_F000279A%7C_F000279A_x&dbOnly=_F00028A8%7C_F00028A8_x&uidh=9w2">identified</a> him as an Albany mainliner and one of a number of Afro Albanian skippers and <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">river people</a>.

<p>In June 1831, he joined <a href="../l/blattimore8200.html">Benjamin Lattimore</a> and fellow skipper and neighbor <a href="../s/sschuyler8492.html">Samuel Schuyler</a> as delegates from Albany at a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=06kJAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA65&lpg=RA1-PA65&dq=%22francis+march%22&source=bl&ots=0vpaNY3V9r&sig=VQWDHRiUbbLJAx_vi1gw75F7-wQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sFwRUM7CGabk6QHRxYDIAw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22francis%20march%22&f=false">First Annual Convention of the People of Color</a> in Philadelphia. The delegates were self-characterized as the "ablest Colored men in the country."

<p>Francis March was dead by March 28, 1833 when his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate. It <a href="#sources">mentioned</a> his wife "Cornelia," so perhaps he had re-married.

<p>With so many outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on for now!</p>
