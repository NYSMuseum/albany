<P>Furniture maker <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Meads</strong></a> is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in Polesworth, Warwickshire, England in June 1777. <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/John_Meads_Albany_Cabinetmaker.html?id=c8dvNwAACAAJ">Thus</a>, he would have been the son of Eloias and Sara Alsop Meads.  <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/furniture/chest_dr.htm"><img src="../../images/jpg/mc/randel_meads.jpg" align=right height=135 width=200 border=0 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="furniture label of Randel and Meads"></a> 

<p>He is said to have come to America when he was fifteen and learned the cabinetmaking trade in New York City. In 1802, he was a journeyman and set out to find his fortune in the booming city of Albany.

<p>By the early 1800s, while still in his twenties, John Meads was producing cabinets and other furniture in Albany. In 1802, merchant <a href="../s/tesling5444.html">Tunis Slingerland</a> advertized that a Meads-made cabinet was available at his shop on Market Street. Over several decades, he was involved in a number of furniture-making partnerships perhaps beginning with his <a href="../c/elcrane.html">father-in-law</a> - who died in 1811. 

<p>In April 1804, he married "<a href="../c/locrane.html">Loisa (Louisa) Crane</a>" at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra Ames</a> painted portraits of the couple in 1816. At least two of his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6PhWFft6_WsC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=%22john+meads%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0GUkPSVqrW&sig=HBagRilzSattb6RNbombiHXlDdc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bGS_T7OEJtCK6QGhnKDICg&ved=0CE4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=%22john%20meads%22%20albany&f=false">sons</a> carried on their father's craft. 

<p>He was a member and trustee of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a> until its dissolution in 1824. He was an officer and/or supporter of a number of Albany-based enterprises including <a href="http://www.maritimehistoryofthegreatlakes.ca/documents/hgl/default.asp?ID=s010">steamboat</a> initiatives, the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fTZYAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=%22john+meads%22+albany&source=bl&ots=HUJSPFtF-K&sig=zQ75ymVqasPw7moXj1mrkN3GBNw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4mi_T-zoCYmg6QHR6JimCg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&q=%22john%20meads%22%20albany&f=false">medical college</a>, and later the <a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/library/speccoll/albany.html">Albany Water Works</a>. 

<p>His creations are included among the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/collections/furniture/chest_dr.htm">collections</a> of the Albany Institute of History and Art. His fine cabinetry maintains high market <a href="http://www.nealauction.com/toplots/americanfurniture/">value</a>.

<p>The third ward assessment for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a> valued his house and property on Market Street substantially. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, his household including three children, five young men and three young women were articulated on the Albany census.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22meads+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22meads%20john%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#first">located</a> the furniture shop of John Meads at 97 Market Street. Over the course of a long Albany life, his shop on Chapel Street and residences on North Market were staples of the annual <a href="../../sources.html#ad">listings</a>.

<p>In July 1818, he escorted a "special coffin" made for the remains of General Montgomery to Troy under the direction of Governor Clinton.

<p>About 1829, <a href="../h/phhooker.html">Philip Hooker</a> designed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jzM8wF0vWdQC&pg=PA313&lpg=PA313&dq=%22john+meads%22&source=bl&ots=yhO5Ifq5D4&sig=9gTmD_0QuSejnDb8nBg1AfP3fVE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pr6vT-jsN4bG6AGe5OCWCQ&ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22john%20meads%22%&f=false">house</a> for him that still stands at 99 <a href="../../streets.html#columbia">Columbia Street</a>.

<p>Louisa Crane Meads died in January 1854 at the age of sixty-nine. Furniture maker John Meads died in 1859 and was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=1324">buried</a> at the Albany Rural Cemetery where a large monument marks his resting place. His <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in March. </p>
