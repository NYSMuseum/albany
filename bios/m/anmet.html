<strong>Ann Metcalf </strong></a> probably was born about 1775. She would have been the daughter in the large <a href="#family">family</a> of  <a href="simetcalf.html">Simon</a> and <a href="../m/cametcalf.html">Catherine Humphrey</a> Metcalf who at that time were living in what became northern Vermont.  

<p>During the 1780s, these Metcalfs re-located to Albany and to a <a href="../../census1790.html#sm">house</a> in the second ward - where the soon-to-be widow Metcalf <a href="../../census1800.html#camur">resided</a> for many years.

<p>In November 1800,  Ann married <a href="../y/jwyates.html">John Waters Yates</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage prduced a number of children. She seems to have been associated with <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. A year earlier, her <a href="elmetcalf.html">sister</a> had married another Albany native. 

<p>Ann had married a college-educated banker whose home was at 69 State Street. For almost thirty years, these Yateses were prominent main street residents. Her husband's exceptional intellect and wit <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V5UPAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=random+recollections+albany&source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&cad=0_1#PPA66,M1">stood out</a> even among a number of famous Yates family members. Ann Metcalf had married well if not for ever after.

<p>John W. Yates died in April 1828 at the age of fifty-nine.

<p>In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1830</a>, the widow of John W. Yates was living at 306 North Market Street.

<p> Ann Metcalf Yates died in June 1846 and was buried in the Episcopal cemetery plot. She had lived seventy-five years.
