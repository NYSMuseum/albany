<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Janet Martin</strong></a> was a historically visible Albany householder during and after the era of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Am</a>erican Revolution. At this point, we are <a href="../qqqq.html">unsure</a> if she was a member of the Albany Martin family, a Martin widow, or <a href="../../res/origins.html">came</a> to and was living in Albany under other circumstances.

<p>She may have been in Albany as early as February 1744 when Janet and Pieter Maarten witnessed the christening of Anna Hilton at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In January 1779, she witnessed a Martin family christening with Johannes Hoghkerk. In 1790 and afterward she was identified as a pewholder at the church. Otherwise, extant Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church</a> records provide neither marriage nor baptism information about her. 

<p>Widow or spinster, her name appeared in the same <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> location on the Albany assessment roll for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jama">1779</a>, <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jama">1788</a> (perhaps she had boarders in 1788), and in 1799. In all cases, her holdings and assessments were moderate (more than modest). In <a href="../../census1790.html#jama">1790</a>, she was identified as the head of her Southside household with only another female in the home. A map dated <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">1800</a> showed the holdings of "Mrs. Jennet Martin" on a doubly wide lot located on the north side of <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson</a> between Green and Court Streets.

<p>In May 1804, "Ginnet Martin" was buried from the Dutch church. </p>
