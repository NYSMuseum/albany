<strong>Gershom Mott</strong></a> was born in Middletown, New Jersey - perhaps in 1733. His father and brother were "James Motts" but several <a href="http://www.spicerweb.org/Genealogy/Mott/RevWar/Descendants%20of%20Gershom%20Mott.htm">ancestors</a> were named "Gershom." His mother was Mary Holmes.  

<p>Growing up in New Jersey, during the 1760s he relocated to New York City where he became involved in the opposition to the Stamp Act> Subsequently, he became identified with the anti-British activists who <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">became</a> revolutionaries during the mid-1770s. With his father and brother, he was a prominent businessman who was involved in the lumber trade. 



<p>In 1775, he was appointed Captain of an <a href="http://www.mottsartillery.org/history.htm">artillery company</a> in the First New York Regiment of the Continental Line. He <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">took part</a> in the ill-fated <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EZXA8G0jMf0C&pg=PA208&dq=gershom+mott+subject:%22History%22&lr=&sig=ass9FQpQL1Hwrmfq8oTuBhHz3ng#PPA101,M1">invasion</a> of Canada later in 1775 and 1776. He served in the Continental army throughout the war in Canada, New York, Connnecticut, New Jersey, and in the South.

<p>His wife was <a href="../w/elwilliams.html">Elizabeth Williams</a>. The couple had two daughters.

<p>By the end of the war, Mott and his wife had settled in Albany.

<p>Gershom Mott died in Albany in May 1786 at the age of forty-three. He was buried on May 27 from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
