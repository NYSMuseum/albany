<strong>Mary Martin </strong></a> was born  in February 1749. She was the first child born to the marriage of Peter and Elizabeth Burns Martin. Her father died in 1755 and was buried in Albany. A half century earlier, her soldier grandfather first came to Albany to <a href="../../garrison.html">serve</a> at the fort. 

<p>About 1772, she married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> native <a href="../vw/hevwie6576.html">Hendrick Van Wie</a>. By 1790, six or seven of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>This Van Wie family lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> - probably between Court Street and the river. Her husband was a carpenter who also performed services for the city government. In <a href="../../census1790.html#6576">1790</a>, their household included eight family members and two slaves.

<p>Henry Van Wie died in October 1795. Following his passing, Mary relocated to the outer part of the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where the "widow of Hendrick Van Wie" owned a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">modest house</a> and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a>.  In <a href="../../census1800.html#6577">1800</a>, her household included eight young people - the slaves were gone. By that time, Widow Mary had become impoverished. Over the next two years, she received regular but small alms from the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At this point, we have not connected her to the municipal <a href="../../poor.html">poor</a> list. 

 

<p>Widow Mary Martin Van Wie was fifty-two when she died in May 1801 and was buried "gratis" by the Dutch church.</p>
