<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, this <a href="#sources"><strong>John Mc Michael</strong></a> was listed on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1790.html#jomc">1790</a> as the head of a household (aka Mc Mickle) in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. We seek defining information on his precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Qualitative material on same-named contemporaries living in the region and dating from the 1750s dictates caution in fleshing out the life of this city resident.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#jomc">1767</a>, the name "John Mc Mickell" was included on the roster of a city-based <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. 

<p>Perhaps this individual was the "John Mc Michael of Albany Co." a "cooper", who posted a marriage bond with <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Angeltie <a href="../k/kidney.html">Kidney</a>," an Albany Co. spinster in April 1773. If so, four children were christened <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=engeltie+kidney&source=bl&ots=-_vaG-FZbp&sig=89QFQEALWV82Wmo9bScPbpvr9mE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBWoVChMIjMrO-478yAIVCFseCh1O9QB2#v=onepage&q=engeltie%20kidney&f=false">by them</a> in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1779 and 1792. 



<p>In January <a href="../../org/cc.html#1787">1787</a>, his account was submitted to the city council  for payment. After some deliberation, on February 17, the "Chamber" paid him &pound;4:2:6.  


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jomc">1790</a>, the second ward household of this "John Mc Mickle" consisted of three males over 16, two boys under 16, and three female members of unspecified ages. It was included at the end of the second ward enumeration. The city assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, valued his house and lot in the same general location and also his personal property modestly but not minimially. In 1802, a partial assessment roll for the second war noted his house and lot (probably on Fox Street) with real property worth "98" [sic] and personal holdings valued at "5."

<p>Beyond that, his name has not yet been encountered in the community-based record. With essential life <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> still unanswered, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now! </p>
