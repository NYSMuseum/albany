<P>According to <a href="../../res/irs.html#links">family</a>-based sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Simon Metcalf</strong></a> was born in Yorkshire, England in September 1735. He was the son of Simon and Elizabeth Colton Metcalf of Yorkshire. 

<p>In May 1763, he married <a href="cametcalf.html">Catherine Humphrey</a>. The marriage produced at least nine children - but only the first two were born in England. The Metcalfs emigrated to New York  (first settling in New York City) about 1765 - leaving their eldest <a href="geomet.html">son</a> behind to be educated in Europe. A new-born daughter <a href="http://www.genealogy.com/genealogy/users/p/e/t/Kathy-Petersen/index.html">may have been left</a> in England as well. 

<p>However, at least one <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EB2Q1un0tzkC&pg=PA196&lpg">source</a> has called Simon Metcalf an officer and a veteran of the Seven Years War.

<p>About 1769, he <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Old_New_York_Frontier/Part_3/Chapter_2">was identified</a> as a surveyor working on the western boundary (Stanwix treaty line) of New York. By 1770, he had secured an appointment as "Deputy Surveyor" in the province of New York and produced a number of land maps of greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. He was <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/sirwilliamjohnson00buelrich/sirwilliamjohnson00buelrich_djvu.txt">known</a> to William Johnson.
 
<p>Metcalf was involved in a number of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA533&lpg=PA533&dq=%22simon+metcalf%22+albany&source=web&ots=Fjo60YodLf&sig=zjxE8_5V-uY9M1wIUoxL0_Jc0es&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=2&ct=result#PPA663,M1">patents</a>. In compensation for his work, in 1771, he received a large tract along the Missisquoi River where he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=%22metcalfe">settled</a>  his budding family, opened a fur trading post at the mouth of the river, and commenced a logging operation. The 30,000 acres New York patent encompassed much of present-day <a href="http://www.swantonhistoricalsociety.org/main/swanton_history.asp">Swanton</a>, Vermont.

<p>At the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">outbreak</a> of hostilities, he supported the Revolutionaries and was taken prisoner by the British and brought to Montreal. Between 1778 and 1779, two children were born in Montreal. In 1781, he seems to have been living in Canada and was supplying trusted <a href="../../sources.html#cp">information</a> to Governor George Clinton.

<p>His property on Lake Champlain was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=fKwNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT459&lpg=PT459&dq=simon+metcalf%22&source=web&ots=xx3WHk5A3F&sig=gRR3_rTgwFra6HtSspVLrdgFp5E&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result">destroyed</a> during the War and title to it subsequently passed to members of the Allen family who had him turned out and  banished from Swanton <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EB2Q1un0tzkC&pg=PA226&lpg">"naked and destitute."</a> 

<p>Sometime following the end of the war, he settled his family in Albany. 

<p>During the 1780s, he also had taken a consignment of seal furs that had been shipped from the Falkland Islands and were stored in New York City . In 1787, he acquired the trading ship <i>Eleanor</i> and, in September,  set off with a cargo of furs for China. For seven years, he and his sons traded to the Far East. One son was killed by islanders in Hawaii.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#sm">1790</a>, his household was configured in a had settled his family into a house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. However, it is doubtful whether Metcalf himself had returned to Albany at all after leaving New York in 1787. His son and wife were living in a second ward house in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#gm">1788</a>. He seems to have been been in the Pacific for the better part of all those years.  In 1794, Metcalf and his crew were killed by natives on Queen Charlotte Island in the Pacific Northwest.

<p>Simon Metcalf's widow and surviving children <a href="../../census1800.html#camur">lived</a> on in Albany. Catherine Murphy Metcalf died in 1818 and was buried in the Episcopal cemetery.</p>

<strong>Sources:</strong> 
The life of Simon Metcalf has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. We have adopted the <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elling "Metcalf" because both census and assessment records showed that form. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../res/irs.html">community-based resources</a>.  This fascinating historical character has been the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/kona/history3.htm">subject</a> of a number of biographical <a href="http://www.realestatemauihawaii.com/newsletters/jan2003nl.php">treatments</a>. Although it focuses on his trading career almost to the exclusion of his Albany-related existence, Metcalf's fascinating story is told by <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0919642373">Rhys Richards</a> in <i>Captain Simon Metcalfe: Pioneer Fur Trader in the Pacific Northwest, Hawaii, and China, 1787-1794.</i> <p></p>
