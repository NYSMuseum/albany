<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Muller</strong></a> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in January 1688. He was the son of <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany</a> area residents Cornelis Stevense and Hilletie Lookermans Muller.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1716">1716</a>, he was appointed firemaster in the third ward.

<p>His wife was named <a href="../../res/sp.html">Agnietje</a> (<a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ga4/myhayes_family/f_302.html#8">probably</a> Conyn). Between 1719 and 1731, six children (including one Leendert) were christened at the Albany church. These Mullers were witnessing baptisms in the church as late as mid-1755.


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#jamu">1720</a> and in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#jamu">1742</a> as well, his name was included on lists of freeholders in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In May 1727, city records <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany09munsuoft#page/19/mode/2up">referenced</a> his lot within an order to pave the <a href="../../wards.html#2">street</a> that ran between the second and third wards.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#309">1756</a>, a census of Albany buildings taken by the British army <a href="#note">noted</a> that he was living in or next to an empty Albany house.

<p>Jacob Muller's wife was buried from the church in June 1759.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, Jacob Muller's property in the third ward was valued modestly. At that time, the name of a Jacob Muller also appeared on the tax rolls and militia lists for Claverack.
 
<p>This Jacob Muller was an Albany resident. His <a href="jomuller483.html">brother</a> and at least his sons <a href="jomuller5309.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="phmuller.html">Philip</a> also were Albany residents. At this point, we move on having many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> about his life. </p>

<p><a name=note></a>His name was included in the index to that list and was linked to the empty house #310.
