<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hugh Mc Adams</strong></a> lived in Albany during the late 1770s and early '80s. The existence of a number of same-named contemporaries <a href="../qqqq.html">complicates</a> our ambition to definitively profile his life. His <a href="../irish.html">Scottish</a> surname, however, does provide a place to <a href="../../res/origins.html">start</a>.

<p>Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">War</a> rosters include the <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_levies_albany.htm">name</a> of "Hugh Mc Adam" as an enlisted man in the third regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.  

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7091">1779</a>, his personal property was valued at the end of the assessment roll for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. On the October tax list for that year, his personal property was valued substantially and he was among those assessed for a "hired house" as well.

<p>This individual is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mcadams/NY.html">said</a> to have married Catharina <a href="../g/gerritse.html">Ge</a>rritsen at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on May 6, 1780. The only actual record for them in the printed records was of a daughter who was christened there in August. Another daughter was baptized at the Dutch church in Saratoga in 1790.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7091">1781</a>, he was among those newcomers who purchased the freedom to do business in the city. At that time, he was identified as a merchant.

<p>Although in Albany during its lifetime, the only reference to "Hugh Mc Adam" in the records of the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Comm</a>issioners is to an undated <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting02paltrich#page/812/mode/2up">account</a> due to him for thirty-two pounds. Many of the other  newcomer merchants had more extensive and unpleasant experiences with that wartime organization.

<p>After that his name appears to have dropped from city-based rolls.


<p>In March 1782, he is <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mcadams/NY.html">said</a> to have witnessed the will of Barnet H. Wemple. At that time, he was identified as a Revolutionary war soldier. Over that winter, Mc Adam had a business <a href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/duer.html">account</a> with <a href="../d/wmduer.html">William Duer</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of Hugh Mc Adams was configured on the census of Saratoga. In 1794, he was identified as owing more than twenty-four pounds to the <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html">estate</a> of the late William Shepherd of Albany.
<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Hugh Mc Adams. For now, too many un-resolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> prompt us to move on.</p>
