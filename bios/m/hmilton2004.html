<P><A href="#biography"><B>Henry Milton</B></A> was born during the 1720s or 30s. In 1752, his son was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The child's mother was Jannetie Evans.</P>


<p>Milton was a widower in 1757 when he married <a href="../n/ranorton2021.html">Rachel Norton</a> of Albany. By 1776, six of their children had been baptized in the Albany Dutch church. Another child was baptized in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> Anglican church in 1759 where his parents sometimes stood as baptism sponsors. </p>

      <p>In 1766 and '67, he was assessed one pound as a <a href="#resident">resident</a> 
        of the <a  href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">East Manor</a>. He also 
        served as a private in the Rensselaerswyck company of the Albany County 
        <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. 
      <p>By 1779, he was paying taxes on a modest house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>. Although he occasioned no notice in the community's record for 
        the war years, after the war he was granted a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land 
        bounty right</a> as a member of the Albany regiment of the county militia. 
      <p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#2004">1790</a>, he had moved down the hill into the third ward. In 1797, these Miltons were living in a house owned by Walter Quackenbush on Montgomery Street. In August, that home was among those destroyed during Albany's second great <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a>. Although, a Henry Milton was counted (probably his same-named <a href="hmilton2005.html">son</a>) as the head of a third ward household on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#2005">1800</a>, Henry the elder's fortunes had deteriotated to where his family frequently received small sums from the Dutch Reformed Church.</p>
   
<p>Milton helped repay the grants by digging graves and ringing the bell for the church. In 1801, he dug his wife's grave. A year later, his name was added to the city's list of "permanent <a href="../../poor.html">poor</a>." Henry Milton died in April 1805 and was buried "gratis" from the Albany Dutch church.</p>

        <A name=biography></a>The life of <B>Henry Milton</B> is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 2004. This profile is derived 
        chiefly <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In searching for his origins, we appreciate the need for flexibility in recognizing variable spellings of his name. Perhaps he was the Henry Melton listed on the St. Peter's roster of members for 1771; or the Hendrick Melton noted in the <a href="../../sources.html#jp">papers</a> of Sir William Johnson!</p>

      <p><a name=resident></a><b>Rensselaerswyck:</b> He probably was living in Greenbush 
        near Crailo. However, his residence is not shown on the <a href="../../im/im1767.html">Bleecker 
        map</a> of 1767.</p>
