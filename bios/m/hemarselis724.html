<a href="#sources"><strong>Hendrick Marselis</strong></a> was was born in October 1742. He was the eighth and last child born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="jomarselis733.html">John</a> and <a href="../b/anbeekman3879.html">Anna Beekman</a> Marselis. However, his father died in 1746 leaving widow Anna to raise a large <a href="../../census1756.html#238">family</a>.</P>

<p>In November 1766, he married Albany native <a href="../d/madf4732.html">Maria De Foreest</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage may have produced only one child who did not survive to maturity. He was a member and long time pewholder at the church.

<p>In 1766, he was <a href="../../wills/willgemarselis711.html">named</a> heir and co-executor of his brother Gerrit's estate. In 1769, he was named as an heir and co-executor of his mother's <a href="../../wills/willanbeekman3879.html">estate</a>.  By that time, he had moved forward to establish himself as a merchant and shipper. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a> and 1771, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In 1768, he petitioned for lots on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>.

<P>From the 1760s until his death, he was a first ward <a href="../../census1790.html#724">mainstay</a> as his holdings were accorded modest  <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a> on Albany  rolls.

<p>In 1775, he stood for American liberties when his accounts for service were paid by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>. Perhaps he was the Henry Marselis who, in June 1776, was appointed captain of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company raised in Albany County to reinforce the Continental army in Canada. That officer was on duty north of Albany throughout the summer. In June of 1777, he was elected to represent the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#724">land bounty</a> right under the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>After the war, Henry and his wife settled into their Albany home and were enumerated on city census and <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#724">assessment</a> documents. In <a href="../../census1790.html#724">1790</a>, their household included one slave.  
 
<P>Hendrick Marselis died in October 1802 and was buried from his church. He had lived about sixty years.  His widow survived until 1816.</p>
