<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ahasueras Marselis</b></a> was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="../vb/marjansvb.html">Marselis Janse</a> and <a href="../g/angerr6012.html">Anna Gerritse</a>. He was known by the surname <a href="marselis.html">Marselis</a>

<p>He was one of five children noted in the <a href="../../wills/willmarjansvb.html">will</a> filed by his father in June 1690.


<p>He grew up in Albany but married Sara Heemstreet of Schenectady in December 1697. Their twelve children were baptized between 1698 and 1723 in the Dutch churches of Albany and Schenectady. Ahasueras or "Swear" was a member of the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany church</a> and a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Even prior to his marriage, he <a href="../../census1697.html#092">lived separately</a> in a first ward house. During the late 1690s, he had some unpleasant experiences before the Albany court. After 1700, these Marselises relocated to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where he was known as a cordwainer. He retained his Albany home for <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#623">several years</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was still alive in 1727 when he was paid (along with two sons) for work done at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>!</p>
