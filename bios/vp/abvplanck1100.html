<P>One time Albany resident, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham Isaacse</strong></a> probably was not the son of Guleyn and Hendrickse Wessels Verplanck who was born in 1674 as some family-based sources claim. However, he was one of a number of boys named for the <a href="abivplanck1099.html">founder</a> of this early American Verplanck family. He often was <a href="../../res/sp.html">referred to</a> as "Abraham Isaacz." His ancestry has been and is <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002040693997;view=1up;seq=93">puzzling</a>. We seek information on this Abraham's early years and <a href="../../res/origins.html">path</a> to Albany.

      <p>About 1687, this individual married <a href="../s/ansickles7033.html">Anna Sickles</a> 
        (but probably not in Albany). By 1695, at least five children were christened 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents 
        had been counted as members from the earlier <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/part1.html">recordings</a> 
        of the church. Their first son was named Isaac and the second Zacharias. 
      <p>In August <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7&q=sluyter#v=snippet&q=sluyter&f=false">1695</a>, city records identified "Ab. Isaaks" as the "Fort Sluyter" (perhaps the gate closer) when he submitted his bill for services.

<p>His name does not appear on the city and manor censuses for <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>. However, in that year two men were <a href="../../census1697.html#135">counted</a> in the first ward household of <a href="isvplanck1127.html">Isaac Verplanck</a> - probably his uncle. Two years later, "<a href="../../lists/list1699.html#1100">Abraham Verplank</a>" was among the residents of Albany and its environs who signed a loyalty oath to the royal governor.  After that, his name seems to have dropped from the community-based record. 

<p>The subsequent life of this onetime Albany resident continues to elude our ongoing sweeps of community, family, and <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet-based</a> resources. Thus, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
