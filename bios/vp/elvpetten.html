<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Van Petten  Abel</strong></a> is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=vanpatten&id=I08585">said</a> to have been born in July 1780. She was the daughter of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents Henry S. and Hester Fairly Van <a href="../../res/sp.html">Petten</a>. 

<p>By 1800, she had wed Albany native <a href="../a/heabel.html">Henry Abel</a>. Beginning in that year, a number of their children were christened at and buried from the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. 

<p>Her husband owned property in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">third ward</a> that was destroyed in the fire of <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">1797</a>. During the early 1800s, these Abels <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22abel+henry%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22abel%20henry%22&f=false">lived</a> near the city <a href="../../citylimits.html">line</a> on Market and then Orange Streets.

<p>Elizabeth Van Petten Abel is said to have died in 1825. She was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> with the Abels in the plot of their Albany church. Thus, she would have lived for about forty-five years - although that life span does not compliment the dates given for her birth and death. Additionally, an Elizabeth Abel was granted <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">letters</a> of administration in January 1830 although her husband lived on in Albany until 1832.

<p>With unresolved issues on her life, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
