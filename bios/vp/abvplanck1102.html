<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham Verplanck</strong></a> was born in May 1739. He was a younger son of <a href="guvplanck1119.html">Guleyn</a> and <a href="../vd/arvdp6236.html">Ariaantie Vanderpoel</a> Verplanck. He grew up in the second ward home of a frontier trader turned businessman and civic leader. His father died in 1749 leaving the widow to raise her children in an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#133">home</a>.

<p>It <a href="../qqqq.html">appears</a> that Abraham was invloved in the northern supply train (including carrying rum to Lake George and Crown Point) during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. The "<a href="#nysl">Abraham Verplanck Papers</a>" at the New York State Library (especially a journal perhaps covering 1758-84) bear investigation.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1760">1760</a>, he was named constable for the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1762">1762</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the ward.

<p>In August 1761, he married a somewhat older <a href="../b/mabogert6129.html">Maria Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Two children were christened there in 1763 and 1768. His first wife appears to have died because, in July 1772, he married Helena <a href="../l/lansing.html">L</a>ansing also at the Dutch church. That union appears to have been childless.

<p>At the time of his first marriage, he was called a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">cooper</a>.

<p><a href="#river">A</a>t some point afterwards, he would be numbered among Albany's <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">rivermen</a>. In October 1774, he advertized in New York that he would pay a reward for the sails stolen in New York City. He later was known as a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> mariner and was a landholder in the Manor.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north end</a> Albany house and property were accorded a moderate assessment. In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1102">1779</a>, his second ward lot was valued on the city assessment.

<p>In 1779, he joined in a community-based <a href="../../doc/pettillman1779.html">petition</a> to the governor regarding John Tillman, Sr. After the war, Abraham Verplanck was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1102">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>Abraham Verplanck was not yet forty-five when he filed a <a href="../../wills/willabvplanck1102.html">will</a> in March 1784. At that time, he identified himself as a Rensselaerswyck mariner and in "perfect memory." However, he was dead by March 24 when the will passed probate.</p>
