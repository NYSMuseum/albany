<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Catharina Verplanck</B></A> was born in 1639. She was the daughter of New Netherland pioneers Abraham and Maria Vigne Roos <a href="#name">Verplanck</a>. </P>

<P>She married recently arrived <a href="../s/dapschuyler1262.html">David Pieterse             Schuyler</a> in 1657 at the New Amsterdam Dutch church. In her wedding papers, she acknowledged that she had been born in New Amsterdam. Her eight children were born between 1659 and 1678 and were baptized in the Dutch churches of Manhattan and Albany. Both Catharina and her husband were prominent members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</P>

<p>From the 1660s thru the end of the century, these Schuylers lived in a <a href="#home">landmark</a> Albany house near the river and just inside the north gate of the <a href="../../1686.html">city stockade</a>. </p>

<p>In May 1688, David Pieterse's <a href="../../wills/willdapschuyler.html">will</a> bequeathed to her his "great house" and other Albany assets for the duration of her "natural life."

<p></p>David Pieterse Schuyler died in 1690. At that time, all eight of their  children were still living. Catalina was named executor and chief beneficiary of his estate. As her children began to start lives of their own, Catalina <a href="../../census1697.html#058">continued to live</a> in the North Albany <a href="#home">home</a>. She died in October 1708.<p></p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Catharina Verplanck Schuyler</B> 
            is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 1108. This profile is derived chiefly 
            from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We have found interesting 
            reading on the Verplancks on several <a  href="http://www.user.shentel.net/neals/v-v-v.html#am">Internet 
            websites</a>. The spelling "Verplanck" has been adopted for consistency.</P>

          <p><a name=name></a><b>Family:</b> Abraham Verplanck and French-born 
            Marie Vigne may have been in New Netherland as early as 1634. Reportedly, 
            Catharina's mother and father both died in Albany in about 1670 and 
            1690 respectively. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a></p>

          <p><a name=home></a>Her <b>house</b> was on the southeast corner of 
            today's Broadway and Steuben Street. In 1699, her petition to add 
            fourteen feet to the north side of her lot was denied because it was 
            too close to the stockade. The "little house on the street" was occupied 
            by her sons, <a href="../s/abschuyler921.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../s/jacschuyler1326.html">Jacobus 
            Schuyler</a>. The Schuylers lived on that site into the nineteenth 
            century. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a></p> </font size>
