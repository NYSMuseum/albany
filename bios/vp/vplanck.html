<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the story of the <a href="#sources"><strong>Verplanck</strong></a> family in America begins with the arrival of <a href="abivplanck1099.html">Abraham Isaacse</a> in <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the 1630s. This family patriarch and his wife <a href="../v/mavigne.html">Maria Vigne</a> (died about 1671) lived in lower New York. Abraham Isaacse <a href="../../res/ts.html">may not </a> have ventured as far north as Beverwyck/Albany and died about 1691. We are <a href="../../res/guess.html">not</a> certain of the connection of Abraham Isaacse's contemporary, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&site=&source=hp&q=%22jacob+albertse+verplanck%22&oq=%22jacob+albertse+verplanck%22&gs_l=hp.3...1329.6666.0.6932.26.26.0.0.0.0.130.2129.22j4.26.0....0...1c.1.32.hp..9.17.1418.YLuwhG0Wtug">Jacob Albertse</a> Verplanck, who seems to be <a href="../../na/na.html">tang</a>ential to the Albany family and to the early Albany record.

<p>In 1657, daughter <a href="cavplanck.html">Catharina</a> married one of the first Albany Schuylers while her younger sister <a href="arvplanck1104.html">Ariaantie</a> was the first wife of a middling Albany mainstay. Son <a href="isvplanck1127.html">Isaac</a> became an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#135">mainliner</A> and the father of at least ten children.

<p>A puzzling individual called <a href="abvplanck1100.html">Abraham Isaacse Verplanck</a> raised a family in the Albany area and was the city gatekeeper in 1695.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#135">1697</a>,only Isaac Verpanck's household was configured on the Albany census.
		
<p>As <a href="guvplanck1119.html">Gulian</a> became <a href="wmvplanck1172.html">William</a>, the family continued to adapt to its life in America.

<p>In 1722, surveyor <a href="phvplanck.html">Philip Verplanck</a> would be named sheriff of Albany city and county.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#133">1756</a>, the home of "widow valplantin" also included at least two adult sons.

<p>In 1790, only <a href="../../census1790.html#1172">one</a> Verplanck named household was counted on the Albany census. However, three more Verplanck families were enumerated in surrounding <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. Two households located in Fishkill (Dutchess County) and one on Manhattan completed the statewide family demographic. However, Verplanck <a href="arvplanck1106.html">daughters</a> continued to be represented in city households. By the time of the printing of the first city directory in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, the name dropped from early Albany rolls.

<p>Beginning with "Ver Planck Street," in the residential Upper Washington Avenue section of today's Albany (which is more associated with descendant and Victorian surveyor and Adirondacks advocate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verplanck_Colvin">Verplanck Colvin</a>), the family name has been applied to numerous locations across New York State and beyond. <a href="http://www.mountgulian.org/verplanck.html">Mount Gulian Historic Site</a> in Westchester County commemorates the family's earliest days in America.</p>
