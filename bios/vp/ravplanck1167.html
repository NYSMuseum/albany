<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rachel Verplanck</strong></a> was born in May 1700. She was the daughter of <a href="isvplanck1127.html">Isaac</a> and Agigail Uytenbogert Verplanck. She was the last child born into a large newcomer family and grew up in Albany's second ward.

<p>In January 1726, she married <a href="../w/jowinne2974.html">Jan Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1728, three children had been christened at the Albany church.

<p>Like her father, these Winnes made their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Jan was able to augment his initial holdings.

<p>However, in March 1736, "Rachel Winne," "a wedow," was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+rachel+winne&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22annals%20of%20albany%22%20rachel%209&f=false">forgiven</a> her debts by the city council. Her brother, <a href="guvplanck1119.html">Guleyn</a>, was referenced in the minutes as well.

<p>Rachel's status as a widow is further supported by the burial of Jan Winne in August 1733. However, subsequent information shows that Jan (son of Daniel) Winne lived for at least two more decades.

<p>At this point, we must step back from these Winnes as apparent conflicting information leaves us with unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Rachel Verplanck Winne. </p>
