<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Willem Verplanck</strong></a> was born in November 1727. He was the second son of <a href="guvplanck1119.html">Guleyn</a> and <a href="../vd/arvdp6236.html">Ariaantie Vanderpoel</a> Verplanck. He grew up in the Albany home of a frontier trader turned businessman and city official. His father died in 1749 leaving his mother to raise their family in a <a href="../../census1756.html#133">house</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In July 1759, Willem was thirty-two when he married the spinster <a href="../l/lylievers.html">Lydia Lievers</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1765, three children had been christened in Albany. At the time of his marriage, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">cooper</a>. 

<p>Willem Verplanck first appeared on the community landscape in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1749">1749</a> when he was appointed constable for the second ward. He settled his family in the third ward where his holdings were accorded moderate <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1172">1763</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany County freeholders.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA825&lpg=RA12-PA825&dq=%22willem+verplank%22&source=web&ots=hq0MrgbxF_&sig=7sibr8RsHv3rSzUurCrKg6LWnGQ#v=onepage&q=%22willem%20verplanck%22&f=false">1767</a>, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In his late forties at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, in 1778, he was among the older residents <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#1172">exempted</a> from active duty. In 1775, he was among the third ward residents who contributed supplies for Ticonderoga. In February 1778, he <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;rgn=full%20text;idno=ABP1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000954">complained</a> that too many soldiers were billeted in his house. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1172">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1172">1779</a>, the personal holdings of William Verplanck were assessed substantially under the third ward lot owned by <a href="../t/abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1172">1788</a>, his third ward property also housed another adult family member. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA205&lpg=PA205&dq=%22william+ver+plank%22&source=bl&ots=jvaLXDq5dV&sig=MPF1y6v-Eh8vo0BgdvyfvhHeECY&hl=en&ei=N9IpTcPECML38AbW1aG0AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CEIQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22william%20ver%20plank%22&f=false">B</a>efore and after the war, he held lots along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.

<p>In February 1787, both parents were listed as sponsors at the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1PAEzZId9fMC&pg=RA6-PA62&lpg=RA6-PA62&dq=%22Willem+and+Lydia+Verplank%22&source=bl&ots=fI2MQeIK0Q&sig=yiy_62NG3q6FmkK9eIW_N7ikitY&hl=en&ei=O_IpTenBC4Sclgee2eT8AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&sqi=2&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22Willem%20and%20Lydia%20Verplank%22&f=false">christening</a> of their <a href="arvplanck1106.html">daughter</a>'s son who was named "Willem."

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA246&lpg=PA246&dq=%22william+verplank%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0SrktrQmBu&sig=-sAapgFyGKzyjK4YAiHOVlPsWFs&hl=en&ei=a9kpTaTRKoO88gbi_vjhAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&sqi=2&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22william%20verplank%22%20albany&f=false">1785</a>, Willem Verplanck was among those paid from the city treasury and his debts were shown on a number of Albany account books during the post war years. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1172">1790</a>, his household included three adults and two slaves. A decade later, his name was no longer found on the Albany <a href="../../census1800.html">census</a>.
