<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Verplanck</strong></a> was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany in 1722. He apparently held that office for a year and was replaced by former sheriff <a href="../w/thwilliams.html">Thomas Williams</a> in September 1723. He seems to have been an Albany resident during the 1720s.

<p>This individual was born in June 1695. He was the son of Samuel and Ariaantie Bayard Verplanck of New York City. Pieter and Johannes Schuyler were <a href="http://www.onentofl.com/chbiblebeekman.html">said</a> to have been his godfathers.  His father was lost at sea in 1698.

<p>This younger son became a surveyor of some note and that business probably brought him to Albany.

<p>Philip married Gertrude, the only daughter of Johannes Van Cortlandt, in April 1718. She ultimately would inherit a portion of the Westchester manor - but apparently not directly thus placing her husband in the spotlight. Their long marriage produced nine children - four of whom were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1721 and 1727.

<p>In August 1722, he was identified as a surveyor and "of Albany" when he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=%22philip+verplanck%22&source=bl&ots=_rQdROAzzk&sig=9RcOOELFYjm5tdvK-kXcvyyFNa0&hl=en&ei=gIMbTb-PEYH88Aasm8CrDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDAQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20verplanck%22&f=false">brought before</a> the city magistrates for making a bonfire outside the city gates and for "making a disturbance" drinking to the health of the king. The so-called transgression  occurred in May. That September, he was appointed sheriff by the royal governor.

<p>Following his term as sheriff, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Y3JIAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA343&lpg=PA343&dq=%22philip+verplanck%22&source=bl&ots=32iE74O99x&sig=_NYw9htXUFqwX64KuSElBOtYUlw&hl=en&ei=gIMbTb-PEYH88Aasm8CrDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20verplanck%22&f=false">represented</a> the Manor of Cortlandt (Westchester County) in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> from 1734 to 1768. Residing on the Manor, he was prominent in provincial affairs throughout that time.

<p>In March 1762, he was made co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willdavplanck.html">estate</a> of his upriver cousin. At that time, he was identified as living on the "Manor of Cortlandt."  

<p>According to a family <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/ny/state/bible/beekman001.txt">bible</a>, Philip Verplanck, Esq., a resident of the  Manor of Cortlandt died on October 13, 1771. He had lived 77 years. His widow survived until 1766. </p>
