<strong>Adrian Gerritse Van Papendorp</strong></a><a href="../../res/sp.html">*</a> probably was born during the first half of the seventeenth century. 

<p>He was married to <a href="../c/jancroon.html">Jannetie Croon</a>. The marriage appears to have been childless. Like his wife, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1678, he was named co-overseer in the <a href="../../wills/willabeel.html">will</a> of his sister-in-law. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#5301">1679</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany householders. During those years, he seems to have been an Albany mainstay as his name appeared regularly in the community <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a>.  


<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1686">1686</a>, he was appointed one of the first <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">aldermen</a> under the new Albany <a href="../../charter.html">charter</a>. He still held that office two years later.


<p>Adrian Gerritse Van Papendorp filed a <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2003-04/1049978314">will</a> in October 1688. It named his wife and nieces as heirs. His estate included gold and silver pieces. It passed probate in February 1689.</p>
