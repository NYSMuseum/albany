<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Verplanck</strong></a> was born in late September 1725. He was the first child born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="guvplanck1119.html">Guleyn</a> and <a href="../vd/arvdp6236.html">Ariaantie Vanderpoel</a> Verplanck. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home of a frontier trader-turned-businessman who died in 1749.

<p>This eldest son probably did not marry but <a href="../../census1756.html#133">lived</a> with his widowed mother and siblings. He also witnessed a number of baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> with his mother and with other women of the community.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1747">1747</a>, he was elected constable and then appointed high constable. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1753">1753</a> and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>, his name was included on the cumulative roster of Albany firemen.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1143">1763</a>, he was named among the freeholders of Albany County. The next year, Isaac G. Verplanck was among those Albany merchants who <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#1143">petitioned</a> the provincial governor.

<p>In March 1762, he was named co-executor of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9EAGAAAAMAAJ&q=isaac+ver+planck#v=snippet&q=david%20ver%20planck&f=false">estate</a> of his cousin <a href="davplanck.html">David Verplanck</a> of Rensselaerswyck. In September 1767, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoglen4933.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor. In September 1772, he was identified as an Albany resident when a notice appeared in the New York newspaper stating that he had laid claim to a lot in New York City that belonged to his great greandfather, Abraham <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EK2mIhswSAIC&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=%22Verplanck+(Planck)%22&source=bl&ots=I6vp9TA3IC&sig=v0FYn_3d15Pm52LrOwXlYF2UOxo&hl=en&ei=c3T6TKqyOMSBlAe8ra3KDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Verplanck%20(Planck)%22&f=false">Verplanck</a>.


<p>Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his second ward property was valued on city assessment rolls - sometimes, his mother was referenced under Isaac's holdings. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1143">1779</a>, his house and property and another <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#ivp">lot</a> were valued on the Albany tax list. After that, his name drops from Albany rolls. 

<p>Fifty years old at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, Isaac supported the Revolutionary cause by pledging to serve if called in the <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#1143">Associated Exempts</a>. In December 1778, he was paid four pounds from the city treasury. In <a href="../../doc/petvd1779.html">1779</a>, he was among the Albany residents who petitioned Governor Clinton for the return of Dr. Van Dyck. Otherwise, his name has not been encountered in our sweep of wartime records. However, afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1143">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.
 
<p>Isaac Verplanck filed a <a href="../../wills/willisvplanck1143.html">will</a> in July 1777. It named his siblings and his nephew as his heirs. It passed probate in January 1791.  His name did not appear in the <a href="../../wills/willabvplanck1102.html">will</a> filed by his brother in March 1784.</p>
