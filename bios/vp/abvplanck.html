<P><a href="#sources"><b>Abigail Verplanck</b></a> was born in 1729. She was the daughter of Albany businessman <a href="guvplanck1119.html">Gulien Verplanck</a> and his wife, <a href="../vd/arvdp6236.html">Ariaantie Vanderpoel</a> Verplanck. Her father died in 1749 but her mother survived for a decade or more in their second ward <a href="../../census1756.html#133">home</a>.</p>


<p>Abigail married Albany baker <a href="../l/salansing3756.html">Alexander "Sander" Lansing</a> in 1753. Apparently, their long marriage was childless. She was a pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>For more than fifty years, these Lansings lived in a landmark home on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market Street</a>. In 1777, she was identified as the sister, heir, and co-executor of the estate of Isaac Verplanck.</p>

<p>Abigail Verplanck Lansing died in October 1805 and was buried from the Dutch church. She was two months shy of her seventy-sixth birthday.</p>
