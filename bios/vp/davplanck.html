<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>David Verplanck</strong></a> was born in April 1695. He was a younger son in the large family of Albany residents <a href="isvplanck1127.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../v/abuten.html">Abigail Utenbogert</a> Verplanck. He grew up in a comfortable home of a tradesman and city official in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his adolescence and early adulthood. Perhaps he was the "David Splank" listed on the roster of an Albany militia company in <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>.

<p>In July 1723, David was twenty-eight when he married a much older <a href="../c/arcoey.html">Ariaantie Coeymans</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their marriage was childless as his bride was more than fifty at the time of the wedding.

<p>David appears to have lived with his new (but older) wife in the Coeymans home on what became known as the "<a href="../../na/coeypat.html">Coeymans Patent</a>" located about ten miles south of Albany. He also seems to have been the business associate of his newly married but also childless brother-in-law, <a href="../c/sacoeymans.html">Samuel Coeymans</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1127">1742</a>, he was counted among the freeholders of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 

<p>David Verplanck (then age 48) lost his wife when seventy-one-year-old Ariaantie Coeymans died in 1743. Any inheritance of Coeymans property is uncertain. However, Verplanck did own land within the city of Albany.

      <p>By the early 1750s, he had remarried (perhaps twice). In November 1752, he 
        wed area native "Catharina Boon" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. Those marriages produced at least the four children he named 
        in 1762. The eldest daughter of the final marriage was christened "Ariaantie." 
      <p>In June 1754, David witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willsacoeymans.html">will</a> of his late wife's brother. That document also referenced Verplanck's land within the Coeymans Patent.

<p>Calling himself a resident of "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeren_Island">B</a>eeren Island," David Verplanck filed a <a href="../../wills/willdavplanck.html">will</a> in March 1762. It named no spouse but divided his assets among the four children. He was dead by April 1763 when the will passed probate.</p>
