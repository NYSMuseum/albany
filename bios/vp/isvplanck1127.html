<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Isaac Verplanck</strong></a> is said to have been <a href="http://altlaw.com/edball/dutchbap.htm#1641">christened</a> in New Amsterdam in June 1641. He was a son in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="abivplanck1099.html">Abraham Issacse</a> and <a href="../v/mavigne.html">Maria Vigne</a> Verplanck. He grew up in the home of a Manhattan businessman and property holder.

<p>Probably by the mid-1670s, he had married <a href="../v/abuten.html">Abigail Utenbogert</a> and had settled in Albany. By 1700, the marriage had produced at least ten children most/all of whom were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents were members and regular baptism sponsors.

<p>In 1678, he purchased a house and lot on the hill in Albany from <a href="../vt/abvtricht6599.html">Abraham Van Tricht</a>. The following year, his home was included on the Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#1127">census</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#1127">1689</a>, his first ward property was valued on the city assessment roll. For several decades he was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#135">mainstay</a>. By <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1127">1709</a>, his primary property was in the second ward and was of modest value. Previously, he had inherited real property in New York from his father's estate. 

<p>He was a shoemaker who actively supported community functions as juror, assessor and collector, and constable. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1686">1686</a>, He was named assistant alderman under the new city <a href="../../charter.html">charter</a>. He was elected and re-elected alderman a number of times afterwards. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#1127">1699</a>, he signed a community-based document pledging loyalty to the king of England.  

<p>Albany mainliner Isaac Verplanck may have passed on by <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a> as his name was not included on a countywide list of freeholders.
