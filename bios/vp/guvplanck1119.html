<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Guleyn Verplanck</strong></a> was born in June 1693. He was the son of <a href="isvplanck1127.html">Isaac</a> and Abigail Utenbogart Verplanck. He was a middle child in the large family of a newcomer shoemaker who settled in Albany during the 1670s. He was <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as "Guleyn" although his same-named <a href="wmvplanck1172.html">son</a> was called "William."

<p>Perhaps he was the "Galyn Splank" identified as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia </a>company in <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#1119">1715</a>.

<p>In September 1721, he was included in a company of young men (mostly from Albany) who were <a href="../../doc/1721inst.html">instructed</a> to establish a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading</a> post on Lake Erie near Niagara. The traders returned to Albany the following September.

<p>Perhaps he also was the merchant "Gulian Verplank" who was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=%22burghers+and+freemen%22&source=web&ots=W4zL6h-NDG&sig=jgYAaGL-vhXYjpAzBa2ydE2OjSg#v=onepage&q&f=false">made</a> a freeman of New York City in August 1723. 

<p>In December 1724, thirty-one-year-old Guleyn married the younger Albany native <a href="../vd/arvdp6236.html">Ariaantie Vanderpoel</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1739, six children had been christened in Albany where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1726">1726</a> and 1736, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the <a href="../../wards.html">second ward</a>. Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">1729</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the second ward.

<p>In October 1727, he was paid for carrying stones to <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. On a number of occasions during the 1730s and 40s, he was contracted to supply and repair the Albany fort and fortifications. During those years, he <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3859.html">witnessed</a> the signing of a number of wills.

<p>In March <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+rachel+winne&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22annals%20of%20albany%22%20rachel%209&f=false">1736</a>, he was a party to an action by the Albany corporation regarding the debt of his supposedly widowed <a href="ravplanck1167.html">sister</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1119">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of second ward freeholders. In December, he petitioned the council for land along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. 

<p>Guleyn Verplanck was buried in July 1749. His widow was still alive and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">living</a> with their sons in 1767.</p>
