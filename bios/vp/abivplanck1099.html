<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously (aka <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002040693997;view=1up;seq=17">Abram Planck</a>),  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham Isaacse</strong></a> was born in Europe during the early part of the seventeenth century. He arrived in <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the 1630s. He is regarded as the patriarch of the <a href="vplanck.html">Verplanck</a> family in America.

<p>By 1635, he is said to have wed the widow <a href="../v/mavigne.html">Maria Vigne</a>. By 1668, their marriage had <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/s/w/i/Jay-Swift/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0160.html">produced</a> at least eight children. Maria was dead by 1671. Abraham Isaacse does not seem to have remarried. Instead, he raised the surviving children in the greater Manhattan area although he is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have spent time in the upper Hudson Valley as well. At this point, we have <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> been able to place this individual on the historical landscape that became the city of Albany.

<p>After a long and <a href="#na">successful life</a> in New Netherland and New York, Abraham Isaacse Verplanck was dead by August 1691 when letters testamentary were issued to Jacob Kipp (his principal creditor) in New York.
		 
<p>Two daughters and a <a href="isvplanck1127.html">son</a> became Albany residents.</p>

<p><a name=na></a>Abraham Isaacse's career has been profiled in <a href="http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=yale.39002040693997;view=1up;seq=17"><i>The history of Abraham Isaacse Ver Planck</i></a>. It is the <a href="../../res/ts.html">best source</a> for much of what we have said about him. Unless we can connect him directly to an Albany life, we probably cannot pursue his story.
