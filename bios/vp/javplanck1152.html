<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Verplanck</strong></a> was born prior to 1700. He probably was the son of an Albany <a href="vplanck.html">Verplanck</a> family.  Multiple potential origins and few <a href="../../famrecon.html">family-based</a> clues dictate <a href="../qqqq.html">caution</a> in fixing his birth date.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#1152">1715</a>, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In September of that <a href="../../org/cc.html#1715">year</a>, he was named constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In 1721, he was <a href="../../doc/1721inst.html">identified</a> as the lieutenant in a company of mostly Albany men who were settle among the Senecas for a year to <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a> for furs. The party returned to Albany in September 1722.

<p>In 1727, he was among those who were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zQIKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA379&lpg=PA379&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false">compensated</a> by the provincial government for provisioning and otherwise assisting the troops at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>. As late as early <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc10844.htm">1735</a> his name was found among those supplying "strouds and rum" for Oswego.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1734">1734</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the second ward.

<p>Perhaps he married Lydia <a href="../va/valst.html">Van Alstine</a> in November 1733 at Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, no children were christened to the couple and only one witnessing of a baptism (1736) was recorded for them in the extant church records.

<p>We move on for now, still <a href="../qqqq.html">seeking</a> defining information on the <a href="../../res/origins.html">or</a>igins and later life of the early eighteenth-century Albany resident knnown as Jacob Verplanck. </p>
