<P>According to family-based <a href="http://www.vanpattenancestry.com/cfvp.html">resources</a>, <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netheland</a> pioneer <a href="#sources"> <strong>Claes Frederickse Van Patten</strong></a> was born in Holland in May 1641. He was in the Albany area by 1664 when he leased a farmstead on the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> flats. He is the patriarch of the Van Patten<a href="../../res/sp.html">/</a>Petten family of New Netherland and New York.

<p>He has been counted among the original <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/vanpetten_c.html">settlers</a> of Schenectady and was identified as a "Husbandman." His holdings have been chronicled <a href="http://www.vanpattenancestry.com/claasfvanpetten.html">online</a>.

<p>In 1672, he married <a href="../b/aebradt.html">Aefie Arents Bradt</a> - daughter of deceased Schenectady proprietor. At least four children were christened by the couple between 1684 and 1692 although their family may have been somewhat larger.

<p>In 1679, he is said to have owned a half interest in a Hudson River sloop.

<p>In 1683 and afterwards, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A subscription <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#clvp">list</a> for that year, included him with the "farmers below." An assessment for <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">1689</a>, taxed him with the "farmers in Marte Gerritse's company."

<p>Between 1683 and 1694, he was identified as a resident of <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html#paps">Papsknee Island</a>. He is said to have missed the so-called Schenectady massacre as, at that time, he was living at <a href="../../res/sp.html">Papsknee</a>.

<p>Under the rule of <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a>, he held minor official appointments.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#clvp">1697</a>, his household was configured on the census in Rensselaerswyck. At that time, his family included three adults and five children.

<p>Afterwards, these aging Van Pattens appear to have returned to their Schenectady holdings. In 1720, two individuals identified as "Claes Van Petten" were included on a list of <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyalbany/census/1720.html">freeholders</a> for Schenectady.


<p>Both Claes Frederickse Van Patten and his wife died in 1728 and were <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=20654471">buried</a> in the Schenectady cemetery. He had lived more than eighty-seven years.</p>
