<P>Between 1757 (perhaps earlier) and 1767, portraitist <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas McIlworth</strong></a> produced paintings of a number of early Albany residents within a career that included distinctive likenesses of a number of prominent colonial New Yorkers.

<p>He was born in <a href="../irish.html">Scotland</a> about 1720 and was the son of limner artist "Andrew McIlwraith" and Anne Mosman (daughter of Scottish portrait painter William Mosman).

      <p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/thmcil.jpg" align=left width=200 height=270 vspace=1 hspace=4 border=1 alt="perhaps a self portrait"></a> 
        By 1757, he was in New York City where he joined the St. Andrew's Society 
        and became an "assistant" and/or manager there in 1759. By May 1758, he 
        was known as a portrait painter and as "McElworth" had a studio in Broad 
        Street. He advertised in New York City newspapers. 
      <p>After living in New York for five years, he moved up the Hudson in search 
        of more commissions. Settling in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">S</a>chenectady, 
        he painted William Johnson, a number of prominent Schenectadians and Albany 
        residents <a href="../e/daedgar7917.html">David</a> and <a href="../g/jagregg7916.html">Jane 
        Edgar</a>, <a href="../vr/cavr.html">Catherine Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler, 
        future signer and Albany native <a href="../l/phlivingston.html">Philip 
        Livingston</a>, <a href="../b/jobradstreet.html">John Bradstreet</a>, 
        as well as a much alluded to but elusive portrait of Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
        Johnson</a>. His relationship with Johnson extended beyond soliciting 
        his preferment to naming his son "William Johnson McIlworth." 
      <p>In October 1760, he married Anna Statia (or Anastasia) Willet of New Jersey. They are thought to have lived for a time in Westchester County. The marriage produced a number of children before her death in 1766. Whether they accompanied him north to <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> is not known.

<p>He is said to have been appointed the first Schenectady town clerk in <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/17.html">1765</A>.

<p>Thomas McIlworth is thought to have left Schenectady two years later. He was last heard from in Montreal in 1767 and is said to have died in Canada about 1769.

<p>His two surviving children were provided for in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bBwXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA173&lpg=PA173&dq=%22thomas+mcelworth%22&source=bl&ots=YN5nNbzmbO&sig=vqkXtkZRfzWpRc-FuBZPGq9MrOs&hl=en&ei=_0gyTNPrJsXflgfy_YC9Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22thomas%20mcelworth%22&f=false">will</a> filed by (possibly) his father-in-law in January 1770.

<p>Although McIlworth probably only visited (or simply passed through) colonial Albany, this sketch is presented in support of his work on early Albany people.</p>
