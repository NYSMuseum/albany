<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Jonathan Pearson</strong></a> was born in Chichester, New Hampshire in February 1813. His Pearson forebears were known as tradesmen, millers, and for service in the Revolutionary army. Jonathan was the son of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7RQCAAAAYAAJ&pg=PR15&lpg=PR15&dq=%22caleb+pearson%22+chichester&source=bl&ots=6qS4N7F621&sig=cPKGliond9v5Y_l5hYJj18qvJEc&hl=en&ei=BiNDTNOXMIL58AaPsZUh&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CB8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22caleb%20pearson%22%20chichester&f=false">Caleb</a> and Mehitable Libbey (1795-1880) Pearson. In 1831, his father quit New England to find a better life in Ohio.

<p>Young Jonathan Pearson appears to have received extensive preparatory training in New Hampshire. But this <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> stayed behind and then followed his brother  Caleb who settled in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. There Jonathan was able to continue his education and graduated first in his class from <a href="http://www.union.edu/about/history">Union 
        College</a> in 1835. He is said to have taught for a year in Philadelphia but returned to Schenectady where he taught science and natural history at Union College for many years. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IW5mAAAAMAAJ&pg=PT263&lpg=PT263&dq=%22caleb+pearson%22+chichester&source=bl&ots=bJj7Edsto3&sig=Wr8fftet4SNuARGZY36dtaadm3w&hl=en&ei=BiNDTNOXMIL58AaPsZUh&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22caleb%20pearson%22%20chichester&f=false">said</a> 
        to have received an A.M. from Union in 1838. He also was the college treasurer 
        and librarian. 
      <p>In April 1841, he married Mary Lord <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22hosford+david%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hosford%20david%22&f=false">Hosford</a> of Albany. The couple had three sons.
 
      <p>Personal interest in his family's history led him to genealogy and then to 
        the study and translation of documents relating to the history of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew 
        Netherland and New York. He is responsible for the production of many 
        invaluable resources - most of which were packaged and popularized by his contemporary, publisher <a href="../../victorian.html#munsell">Joel Munsell</a>. 
      <p>His birth date places him <a href="../../criteria.html">outside</a> our research parameters. Hopefully, the <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a> will help us get to know him better in the future. In the mean time, here are some links to what we have said about Professor Pearson so far:

<p>Jonathan Pearson died in 1887. Although he passed on almost a hundred years before we began our search for the social history of this early American community, Pearson arguably was the single most important contributor to reclaiming and interpreting the history of the <a href="../../criteria.html">people</a> of colonial Albany. He is a charter member of our historian's <a href="historians.html">Hall of Fame</a>.</p>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Young Pearson kept a <a href="http://www.eriecanal.org/UnionCollege/Pearson.html">diary</a> of his travels along the Erie Canal in 1822. Pearson left us many useful           <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/nnkey.html">informational works</a> and essays.
