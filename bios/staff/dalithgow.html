      <P>Historical illustrator/artist <a href="#sources"> <strong>David Cunningham 
        Lithgow</strong></a> was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1868. This minister's 
        son emigrated to New York with his sister Jesse in 1888. Two years later, 
        he relocated to Albany, opened a studio, and married a daughter of long 
        standing rural Albany families. 
      <p>Lithgow lived in the region until his death in 1959. He earned 

      <p>Lithgow's work is important to the <a href="../../index.html">PCALHW</a> 
        in that his scenario depicted important historical events critical to 
        the early Albany story. All appear to have been based on some historical 
        research and sensitivity. But they all require strong leaps of faith for 
        adequate historical credibility. Our first rationalization for using his 
        images is that a particular piece typically offers the only known visualization 
        of a major event in the city's history. In addition, his scenes are people-rich 
        - a particularly appropriate recommendation for our people-first approach 
        to the past. Also, they are handsomely colored.
