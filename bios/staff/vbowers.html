<P>Since 1986, <a href="#sources"><strong>Virginia Bowers</strong></a> has been the official historian of the city of Albany. Appointed by the mayor, the <a href="historians.html">city historian</a> is a <a href="http://www.nysm.nysed.gov/services/historian/winslowdoc.html">municipal officer</a> and public servant. 

<p><a href="http://www.maimonidesschool.org/TNT/Video/PartridgeOral/Interviews/VirginiaBowers/B&P.htm"><img src="../../images/jpg/people/vbowers.jpg" align=left wifth=200 vspace=4 hspace=8 border=2 alt="Virginia Bowers talking about Albany in 2005"></a>Virginia was also a great friend and long-standing supporter of the Colonial Albany Project. Having the good fortune to be able to call on her more than two decades of service as city historian, I am certain that she was the most knowledgeable person of her day on the history of Albany - particularly regarding the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. She took seriously the public historian's task of answering historical questions about the city of Albany and its people. She was a constant and positive presence at historical gatherings and a wonderful colleague. I thoroughly enjoyed our frequent chats.

<p>Virginia Bowers was the author of a book entitled <i>The Texture of a Neighborhood: Albany's  South End, 1880-1940</i> - published in 1991. She has been the subject of a number of media articles and is often enlisted as a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22virginia+bowers%22+albany">resource person</a>. 

<p>A lifelong advocate for her beloved <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a>, Virginia Bowers died on December 30, 2007. She was a great friend and comrade-in-arms and will be sorely missed. She was eighty-four years young!

<p>Virginia never entered the computer age - no e-mail, no website, no Internet presence. For me personally, that was part of her charm. She had a great and orderly mind and memory! However, I'm certain she would politely take exception to this profile. Gosh, I miss that charming lady! </p>

<p><strong>Virginia Bowers</strong> was a life-long history lover! Rising through the banking community to become the first woman bank vice-president in Albany, she later pursued historical studies at the <a href="http://www.strose.edu/Future_Students/Academics/School_of_Arts_and_Humanities/history_grad.asp">College of St. Rose</a> where she received an MA in History and Political Science. Her book grew out of a thesis project. Virginia served on a number of boards of Albany historical and community-based organizations. A recent picture of her working with one of those local groups is available <a href="http://www.maimonidesschool.org/TNT/Video/PartridgeOral/Interviews/VirginiaBowers/B&P.htm">online</a>. A www.google.com <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22virginia+bowers%22+albany&hl=en&start=40&sa=N">search</a> reveals some of her many, recent  contributions.
