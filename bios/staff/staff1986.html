<p><img src="../../images/jpg/people/commoncouncil1986.jpg" align=left width=600 hspace=9 vspace=4 border=0 alt=" the not-so-Dutch Masters - 1985 "><b>T</b>his photo was taken by historical artist <a href="http://www.lftantillo.com/Artist's%20Biography.htm">Len Tantillo</a> in 1985 at the State history office in the Cultural Education Center in Albany. Len insisted on shooting a group of us posed (if not poised) around a table to represent the first <a href="../../corporation.html">Common Council</a> meeting in July 1686. 

<p>This photo served as the model if not the inspiration for his <a href="../../commoncouncil.html">drawing</a> that we often have used to depict the city government in action!</p>

<p>This "passport quality" group photograph (probably taken with Len's camera) included several people who were important to the formation and early history of the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i>. It appeared alongside the "finished" product in several <a href="../../tricentennial.html">Tricentennial</a>  features and in <i>The New York State History Network</i> newsletter in 1986. It occasioned many inquiries which we had no way of servicing - until now!</p>

<p>Seated around the table from left to right are: the mustacheod <b>Joe Meany</b> - close friend, military historian, devil's advocate, and dreamer; <b>Charly Gehring</b> - Dutch translator, close friend, and a terrific and tireless cook; <b>Bob Mulligan</b> - military curator, lover of a good tartan, and all-around eighteenth-century guy; <a href="sbbio.html"><b>myself</b></a> as a boy; <b>Tom Burke</b> - <a href="../../books.html#burke">historian</a>, friend, and great influence on the project during its early years; the late <b>Ed Winslow</b> - beloved by local historians; student intern <b>Mike Hook</b>; graduate intern <b>Carol Laffin</b>; <b>Paul Scudiere</b> - boss and benefactor; and artist <b>Keith Prior</b> - who, among other things, designed the <a href="../../whoarewe.html">project logo</a>.</p>

<p>This bittersweet photo commemorates the earlier years of the <i>Colonial Albany Project</i>. It was the best of times, it was the .  .  .  We were so dumb then. That group laughed a lot and so much actual fun!</p>
