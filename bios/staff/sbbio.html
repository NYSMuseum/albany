Stefan Bielinski is the founder and director of the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i>, a model community history program at the New York State Museum. For more than forty years, he has been a student, teacher, and advocate of the "history of the people, by the people, and for the people"  <a href="sbstmt.html">approach</a> of the community historian.

<p>In June 2013, he <a href="sbretirement.html">retired</a> from his position as Senior Historian in the History Office of the New York State Museum. Currently, he is devoted to the following initiatives as a "practicing" <a href="../../art/art-bbpast.html">Community Historian</a>.</p>

<p>Bielinski is the author of <i><a href="../y/ayjr.html">Abraham Yates, Jr.</a> and the New Political Order in Revolutionary New York</i> (1975); <i>Government by the People: The Story of the <a href="../../charter.html">Dongan Charter</a> and the Birth of Participatory Democracy in the City of Albany</i> (1986); of numerous <a href="../../pub.html#articles">articles</a> and essays on the people of colonial Albany; and of <a href="http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/library/pdfs/articles_books_essays/americanloyalist.pdf">monographic</a> and edited works on aspects of New York State history. He is the principal  writer for "The People of Colonial Albany Live Here <a href="../../index.html"><b>Website</b>.</a></p>

<P>He was a founder of the annual <a href="http://www.nysha.org/nysha/for_teachers/cnysh"><i>Conference on New York State History</i></a> and its coordinator from 1979 to 2001. He is an Executive Board member of the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/nyacademyhistory/executives.htm">New York Academy of History</a> and a 2014 recipient of its Herbert H. Lehman medal for distinguished service. 

<p> Beginning in 1981, <a href="../../art/art-welcome.html"><image SRC="../../images/jpg/people/sb1980s.jpg" border=1 height=150 width=187 align="right" alt="Squirriling away during the early 80s" vspace=2 hspace=8></a>he was joined by a <a href="../../roster.html">diverse group</a> of students, descendants, community people, and professional historians in a cooperative research program dedicated to understanding early American community life by studying the contributions of <a href="../../criteria.html">each</a> of the almost 16,000 men, women, and children who lived in the city of Albany before 1800. More than <a href="../../students.html">250</a> historians have completed the project's program of <a href="../../art/art-welcome.html">basic training in social history research</a>. In addition to publications, the <i>Colonial Albany Social History Project</i> presents the story of early Albany people and their world to diverse audiences through public programs incorporating the popular appeal of creative exhibitions, video imagery, and <a href="../../art/art-rr.html">music</a>.</p>

<p>Steve Bielinski has focused <i>Colonial Albany Project</i> resources on developing "<a href="../../welcome.html">The People of Colonial Albany Live Here</a>" website. His personal agenda is to <a href="../../res/inq.html">articulate</a> every aspect (persons, places, things,  activities, and events) of project learning online. In recent years, he has <a href="../../newfeatures.html">added </a> as many as 400 new web items annually. The project website now contains more than 3,500 interconnected and illustrated items. That initiative will be the <a href="../../res/inq.html">project priority</a> for the foreseeable future.</p> 

<p><a href="../../loc/arc.html"><image SRC="../../images/jpg/people/TU 2013.jpg" border=1 width=200 height=133 align="right" alt="Albany Rural Cemetery Fall 2013" vspace=2 hspace=8></a>Evolving alongside all of the above is a major research and programming initiative entitled "<a href="../../or/or.html">The Other Revolutionaries</a>." It intends to answer the <i>Colonial Albany Project's</i> <a href="../../guide/intro.html">prime</a> research question.  A number of <a href="../../or/or.html#book">chapters</a> and chapter parts are now online. It is evolving and being integrated into the overall Internet exposition on an ongoing basis.</p>

<p>Finally, in all of this, this long journey has been an exciting, captivating, rewarding, frustrating, and, above all, <a href="sbstmt.html">humbling</a> experience. It still knocks me out in every way. I hope for more of the same in the years to come. Going forward, I also hope for more real time interaction with all of you.</p>

<a name=eljefe></a>Captain and crew exploring a Hudson River estuary in days gone by. The kids thought of themselves as pirates. I was JFK in PT 109! Actually, in those days this was essential fieldwork near Staats Island. That foray was part of a larger operation known in these parts as "The Hudson Chronicles!"
