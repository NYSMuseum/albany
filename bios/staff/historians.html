          <p><b>T</b>he death of City Historian <a href="vbowers.html">Virginia 
            Bowers</a> at the end of 2007 has prompted me to submit this page 
            to begin to acknowledge, organize, and pay tribute to those who have 
            come before us to lay the groundwork for present and future historians 
            and the historical study of our historic city. 
          <p>Every one of the individuals listed below was a special and unique 
            character who made long-term and sometimes selfless contributions 
            to the history of our city. Their individual careers may be the subjects 
            of future biographical treatments. Ultimately, this list will encompass 
            all of the major and significant contributors to early Albany's history. 
<p>Admittedly, this is a subjective list and the biographies presented 
            are intended to introduce these Hall of Famers to everyone who encounters 
            this page. I confess that this is a "Tribute Page." It begins to acknowledge 
            the individuals who have meant <a href="../../guide/histres.html#gp">so 
            much</a> to <a href="#me">me</a> and to the <i>Colonial Albany Social 
            History Project</i> for more than thirty years. 

<p> Included below are those who have made significant contributions to the history and historical study of Albany over an extended period of time. Not appearing here are historians whose primary contributions are in the form of publications. They are acknowledged <a href="../../books.html">elsewhere</a> on this website. 
            <p>Some of these individuals were the officially appointed "city historian" 
            - public servants whose tenures tell us much about the state of historical 
            work during their lifetimes. All of them were antiquarians - lovers 
            of the past and compilers of its legacies. For many years until 1986, 
            the city and county historian was the director of the <a href="http://www.albanyinstitute.org/">Albany 
            Institute of History and Art</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=20 height=15 alt="more to come"></a> 
          <p>Here's a preliminary roster of past and passed historians of Albany: 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../e/jaeights2036.html">James Eights</a> (1798-1882)

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../../victorian.html#munsell">Joel Munsell</a> (1808-1880) 
            
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="jopearson.html">Jonathan Pearson</a> (1813-1887) 
           
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="../r/cureynolds.html">Cuyler Reynolds</a> (1866-1934) 
            
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;   <a href="vbowers.html">Virginia Bowers</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; city historian -1986-2007
           
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="topalka.html">Tony Opalka</a> (2008) - current city historian

            <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> This introductory access 
            page is derived chiefly from modern and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
            historical resources</a>. In time, it will become a comprehensive 
            exposition on the historians of early Albany. 
            <p><a name=me></a>Because <a href="sbbio.html">I</a> have been at this 
              too long, on many occasions I have wondered at the paths these individuals 
              have taken to learn what they learned and what they saw as the goals 
              of so much historical detective work. The process of finding, learning, 
              understandings, and then interpreting past truths is what the best 
              of us never forget!</p>
