<P>On October 28, 1663, <a href="#sources"><b>Jan Nack</b></a> married Catharina Roemers in New Amsterdam. At that time, he was identified as "a young man from Utrecht now of <a href="#fo">Fort Orange</a>." He had been living in the region since at least 1660 when he settled his account with Dirck Janse Croon.</p>


<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. In 1681, his name appeared on a list of Albany <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#5287">burghers</a> who were petitioning the court for help in encouraging the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>.  He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 1683, a Dutch church subscription roll listed him as residing "outside the North Gate." </p>

<p>Nack's first marriage produced several children and ended with the death of Catharina before December 6, 1692, when Jan married Sophia Wyberstool, the widow of Hendrick Abelse Ridderhaus.<p>

<p>A mainline Albany resident who leased and then owned houses and property on <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Rom Street</a>, Nack was a small scale fur trader and gunstock maker who served on Albany juries and as constable and assessor for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> during the 1680s and 90s. In <a href="../../census1697.html#153">1697</a>, his home was configured on the Albany census and included three men. Perhaps they were his apprentices - whom he trained as gunstockers, or his recently married son, <a href="andnack5291.html">Andries</a>.  In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html"#5287">1699</a>, he signed an oath of allegiance to the king of England.  His second ward property was included on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessments</a> during the early <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5287">1700s</a>.

<p>In November 1689, common council minutes identified him as a supporter of <a href="../l/leisler.html">Jacob Leisler</a>.</p>

<p>Jan Nack <a href="../../res/ts.html">may have died</a> on December 12 1708.</p>
