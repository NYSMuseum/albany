<P><a href="#sources"><b>Joseph Newland(s)</b></a> was born about 1760. He probably was the kinsman of contemporary Albany resident <a href="dnewland2390.html">David Newland</a>.</p>


<p>He was in Albany in May 1788, when he married Isabel Minnoch of Scotland at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. Their children were baptized at the church in 1789 and 1791. From 1787 to 1792, he served as a church elder.</p>

<p>Church records identified him as a merchant. In December 1786, he was named the administrator of the estate of his "friend" James Murray. In 1787, notices in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> asked Murray's debtors to settle with Newland "otherwise their account will go to a lawyer."  An assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2046">1788</a>, valued his home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. But, his first ward home (probably on lower <a href="../../loc/statestreet.html#lower">State Street</a>) was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#2046">census</a> of 1790.</p>

<p>After February 1791,  when he was named administrator of the estate of John Douglass, the name of Joseph Newland dropped from Albany rolls.</p>
