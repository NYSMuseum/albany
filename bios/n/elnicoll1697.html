<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Elizabeth Nicoll</strong></a> was born about 1747. She was the daughter of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=G1ITAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA216&lpg=PA216&dq=%22rensselaer+nicolls%22&source=bl&ots=LiWxZ3_6t2&sig=ja5D7SnQiAzajtxTDyoWzlMjbCE&hl=en&ei=5NT5SYSTDZ3OMaGPwMAE&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1#PPA216,M1">R</a>ensselaer and Elizabeth Salisbury Nicoll. She was raised in the country home built by her father in the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> section of Renssealerswyck.

<p>In October 1764, she was a young bride when she married <a href="../g/coglen4920.html">Cornelis Glen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Both partners were prominent members and pewholders of the church. However, their marriage probably produced no children.

<p>Glen was a merchant and landholder who lived in a comfortable home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. These  Glens eventually relocated to her family home in Bethlehem. 

<p>Elizabeth buried her husband in the family cemetery in March 1810. Elizabeth Nicoll Glen died in November 1812 at age sixty-five. She also was buried in Bethlehem. Her will passed probate on December 25.
