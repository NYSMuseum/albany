<P><a href="#sources"><b>David Newland(s)</b></a> was born about 1773. He was in Albany by 1794 when he pledged two pounds to support the college. In 1798, his name appeared on lists of prospective jurors. He was called a grocer, victualler, and merchant. In 1799, he was identified as a boarder in the third ward home of future neighbor <a href="../w/elwillett6906.html">Elbert Willett</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2390">1800</a>, he was the sole inhabitant of a third ward residence and named as the <a href="../../census.html">head</a> of the household. In 1801, he belonged to an Albany fire company.</p>

<p>In November 1803, he married Albany resident Jane Mc Harg at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a>. The marriage produced a number of children born during the 1800s.</p>

<p>His home was at 26 <a href="../../streets.html#green">Green Street</a> and his store was on North Market. Beginning in 1813, he purchased a number of lots in the downtown area of the city and later above today's Allen Street. Later, his headquarters appeared to settle at <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">361 North Market Street</a>.

<p>He was a Presbyterian church officer and during the 1820s and 30s a director of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>. He probably was the kinsman of <a href="jonewland2046.html">Joseph Newland</a> - who had settled in Albany by 1788.</p>
 

<p>David Newland died in Albany in May 1855 at the age of eighty-two!</p>
