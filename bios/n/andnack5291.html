<strong>Andries Nack</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s. At this point we are uncertain of his parentage but he probably was the son of Albany trader <a href="janack.html">Jan Nack</a>. However, he sometimes was referred to as the son of <a href="manack5288.html">Matthys Nack</a>.

<p>In 1696, Andries was admitted as a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In November 1713, he married Jannetje La Grange there. No christenings for this marriage were recorded in the church records.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#155">1697</a>, he probably was living his father's Albany house. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5291">1699</a>, he joined other Albany people in swearing a loyalty oath to the king of England.

<p>In 1701, he was identified as a merchant living in Albany. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1707">1707</a>, he was appointed constable in the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1714">1714</a>, he was named second ward firemaster. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5291">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of qualified freeholders living in the second ward. 

<p>In 1726, the Seneca Iroquois asked the royal government in New York to send Andries to the Indian country to instruct "the smith" in Indian language. 

<p>During the 1720s, Andries Nack seems to have relocated to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where he became a member of the Dutch church in 1731. Two years later, he purchased property in Schenectady. His name then dropped from the Albany and Schenectady record.</p>
