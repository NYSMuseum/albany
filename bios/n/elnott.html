<P>In 1804, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Eliphalet Nott</strong></a> became president of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_College">Un</a>ion College in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. From 1798 until then, he was the pastor of the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">First Presbyterian church</a> in Albany. The subject of extensive <a href="#sources">biographical study</a>, this sketch will focus on his six years as a resident of Albany and leave the particulars of his long and energetic ministry and career to Codman Hislop and other chroniclers.
 
<p>Eliphalet Nott was born in June 1773. He was the youngest of the nine children of Stephen and Deborah Selden Nott of Ashford, Connecticut. His father has been characterized as a "shoemaker-farmer." Perhaps, he received a basic education from the woman he later called "the best of mothers." He was profoundly influenced by his older brother, the Yale-trained, New Light minister named Samuel Nott (1754-1852). Sympathetic and reflective by nature, Eliphalet is said to have begun teaching at the "district school" and became "Principal Instructor" at Plainfield Academy by 1793. He was able to graduate from Rhode Island College (now Brown University) in 1795. His theological education continued under his future father-in-law which left him ending the year seeking chiefly to "preach the Gospel of Edwards."

      <p>Seeking to find his way in what New Englanders called the "vacant ground" 
        in New York, this <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> opportunist 
        accepted a call from the "Scotch Presbyterians" in <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/otsego/book/cherry/presbych.htm">Cherry 
        Valley</a>, New York. The particulars of those years are vague and chiefly 
        passed down from the remembrances of his future colleague at Union, young 
        <a href="../staff/jopearson.html">Jonathan "Pinky" Pearson</a>" - one 
        of Albany's pioneer community <a href="../staff/historians.html">historians</a>. 
        After delivering a sermon in Schenectady in 1796, Nott was persuaded by 
        the president of Union College to accept a call to the "Court Church" 
        in Albany where he would serve some of the leading lay Calvinists in the 
        State Capital and where his frail new wife would feel less vulnerable 
        than in the wilderness to which he had formerly aspired. 
      <p>In 1798, twenty-five-year-old Eliphalet Nott embarked on a rigorous regimen of study and service from his Albany pulpit while <a href="../b/sabenedict.html">Sally Benedict</a> Nott raised the children in their home near the church at the corner of <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl</a> and Beaver Streets. In <a href="../../census1800.html#elno">1800</a>, their household included three children and three slaves. During his time in Albany, Reverend Nott was involved with a number of community-based organizations - many of which would continue beyond his actual years of residence. He was a  frequent and energetic public speaker whose views on education, social issues, and spiritual matters created some controversy among his parishioners and beyond.

<p>His first wife <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5YMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7#v=onepage&q=sally%20nott&f=false">died</a> in March 1804 at the age of twenty-nine. He would marry twice more.

      <p>While living in Albany, Nott was an active participant in several facets of 
        secular life - most significantly with respect to the community's transformation 
        and transition. We expect to connect him more closely to the Albany scene 
        both during and after his tenure. 
      <p>In August 1804, he was elected fourth president of Union College where he had served as a trustee since 1800. Relocating to Schenectady, he served in that capacity for more than sixty years. During his tenure, the permanent campus, curriculum, and professional schools came into being.  Eliphalet Nott died at his farm on "Nott Road" in Rexford in January 1866. He had lived for more than 92 years.
