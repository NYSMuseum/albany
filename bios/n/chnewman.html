      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Charles Newman</strong></a> probably was born 
        before 1750 and is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IzIwAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1923&lpg=PA1923&dq=newman+wool+albany&source=bl&ots=XWPLPzhRdf&sig=4RVQcCDWwMygrjb7WvQldIrrKn0&hl=en&ei=HWxlTPyNG4O0lQeEicGSDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=newman%20wool%20albany&f=false">said</a> 
        to have come from Frankfort, Germany. He most likely came to the Hudson 
        Valley as a young man and is said to have been in business in Albany as 
        early as 1768. 
      <p>In December 1773, he married Christina <a href="../../res/sp.html">Si</a>egle 
        at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. Later, 
        he would counted as a member and pewholder at the First <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran 
        Church</a>. It appears that he had a family although no baptisms have 
        been found in the existing records of the early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
      <p>We have not yet connected him to <a href="../../or/or-3r.html"> wartime</a> 
        activities. However, he was granted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#ch">land 
        bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>An early (undated but allegedly 1768) <a href="../../ag.html">news</a>paper 
        advertisement for "Charles Newman and Sons - Woolen merchants - South 
        Market Street" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA264&lpg=PA264&dq=%22charles%22+newman+albany&source=web&ots=GwIcqiwYcg&sig=yj4XAqhR5ZA6DQ9q7MxjqsP7DGw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=10&ct=result#v=onepage&q=%22charles+newman%20albany&f=false">described</a> 
        his business. In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#cn">1781</a>, he was 
        among those who purchased the "freedom" to conduct business in Albany. 
        At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html#mer">merchant</a>. 
      <p>By the mid-1780s, his regularly submitted and sometimes substantial accounts 
        were being paid by the Albany government. At that time, he owned <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#cn">property</a> 
        along what became <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">South Pearl Street</a>. 
        In <a href="../../census1790.html#cn">1790</a>, his first ward household 
        included eight people. His business related to the processing and production 
        of <a href="../../trades/leather.html">animal hides</a> and their products. 
        In 1797, he was identified as a "skinner" and freeholder. The next year, 
        he was called a "glover." 
      <p>Charles Newman was last heard from in January 1800 when he witnessed 
        the <a href="../../wills/willjoostjr.html">will</a> of Albany resident 
        John Ostrander, Jr. However, a tailor named Charles Newman was listed 
        on the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 70 State 
        Street in 1814. Two Newman-named households were listed in the directory 
        in 1815. 
      <p>His descendants (particularly his son <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22henry+newman%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20newman%22&f=false">Henry</a>),
