      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Matthys Nack</b></a> was born about 1670. He was 
        the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="janack.html">Jan</a> 
        and Catharina Roemers Nack. His parents recently had migrated north to 
        the Albany area.</p>
      <p>In July 1698, he married Susanna Lansing in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a member. Twins were born in 1699. However, the 
        marriage was short-lived. In December 1702, he married <a href="../s/agschaets8630.html">Agnietie 
        Schaets</a>. The second marriage produced eight children who were christened 
        in Albany and New York by 1720.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#155">1697</a>, he was accounted for 
        in his father's house on the census. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5288">1699</a>, 
        he signed a community petition pledging loyalty to the king. His second 
        and third ward homes were <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5288">assessed</a> 
        on subsequent tax rolls. In 1715, his name appeared on a <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#5288">roster</a> 
        of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 
      <p>During the first decades of the eighteenth century, Matthys Nack served 
        as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> and constable for the 
        <a href"../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> and, in 1716, as high constable for 
        the city. In 1701, Albany sent him to carry a message to Oneida. His home 
        was an Albany landmark.</p>
      <p>After 1718, his name dropped from Albany rolls. Perhaps he relocated 
        to New York where his last two children were baptized.</p>
