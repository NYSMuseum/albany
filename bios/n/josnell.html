<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Joseph Nelliger</strong></a> was born about 1758. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, we expect that his ancestors first came to <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a>.

<p>Coming of age during the era of the American Revolution, we expect to find relevant <a href="#dar">info</a>rmation on his activities. Afterwards, he was among those accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#jone">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. 

<p>His wife was Hannah (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RpQYrtuOQP0C&pg=PA258&lpg=PA258&dq=%22joseph+nellegar%22&source=bl&ots=Gk2n6-pfWe&sig=ov7nOnddqJ-jucBM3CiFGUG0wVI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LkHSVPqmC8XmsATK1oGoCA&ved=0CD4Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22joseph%20nellegar%22&f=false">Bennet</a>) who <a href="https://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/294/mode/2up/search/nellegar">appears</a> to have been at least ten years younger - thus pointing to a marriage date closer to 1790.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jone">1788</a>, his personal property was assessed within a first ward household. In <a href="../../census1790.html#jone">1790</a>, his household of five people was configured on the census for the first ward. A decade later (listed as "Alligor"), the <a href="../../census1800.html#jone">total</a> had grown to eight including an older woman. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census listings</a> accounted for the growth of the family in that first ward location. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and modest holdings were valued in that location as well. 

<p>Beginning with the first issue in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA81&lpg=PA81&dq=%22nelliger%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22nelliger%22&f=false">1813</a>, city directories listed him as a cartman living on Westerlo Street in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> of Albany. In November 1813, his lot was referenced in a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> transaction.

<p>"Joseph Nellegar" <a href="https://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/294/mode/2up/search/nellegar">died</a> in January 1831 at the age of 73. He was buried in the Episcopal plot. His somewhat younger widow also was buried there in July 1843 at the age of 71.</p>
