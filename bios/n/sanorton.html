      <P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Samuel Norton</strong></a> 
        was born during the late 1760s. Several possible <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        are plausible for this individual with a name not infrequently <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22samuel+norton%22+census+1790">encountered</a> 
        in what became the northeastern United States during the latter part of 
        the eighteenth century. 
      <p>Perhaps he was a son of Samuel Norton, one of the founders of Saratoga 
        Springs. A Samuel Norton was listed as a head of household on the Saratoga 
        census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. 
      <p>About that time, he had married Albany native <a href="../r/elradcliff1044.html">Elizabeth 
        Radcliff</a>. Beginning in 1792, their children were christened at the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
      <p>In 1799, his house and lot in the first ward was valued on the Albany 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment roll</a>. The personal 
        property of his <a href="../r/joradcliff1067.html">father-in-law</a> was 
        listed next to Norton's holdings. In <a href="../../census1800.html#sn">1800</a>, 
        the Nortons were listed on the census in a separate household with John 
        L. Radley's household <a href="../../census1800.html#1067">configured</a> 
        on the line immediately above. During the 1790s, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">included</a> 
        on community-based documents as a freeholder, juror, and bricklayer. 
      <p>With the passing of his father-in-law in 1809, Samuel Norton was acknowledged 
        as the proprietor of <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">48 Hudson Street</a> 
        and was listed in the annual directory as a <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">mason</a>. 
        He also purchased a number of parcels of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> 
        also on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside of the city. 
        However, in 1819, the city directory showed that these Nortons had moved 
        out to an address at 218 <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South 
        Pearl Street</a> where they remained for a number of years. 
      <p>Samuel Norton lost his wife when Elizabeth died in April 1841. After 
        that, he seems to have removed to Lyme, Connecticut and to the home of 
        his married daughter where the Albany newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA334&dq=%22samuel+norton%22+lyme">reported</a> 
        he died in October 1842. He had lived to the age of seventy-three. </p>
