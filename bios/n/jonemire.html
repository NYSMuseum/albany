<P>Spelled and referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Henry Nemire</strong></a> (Nehemiah) was in the city by the late 1780s. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. His long connection with the <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church may suggest Germanic origins. But see also heritage material for <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/p/e/a/Danny-C-Pearce/GENE13-0062.html">Nehemiah</a>.

<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1025">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. In 1818, "John H. <a href="../../res/sp.html">N</a>armir" is <a href="http://www.fold3.com/document/25084960/">said</a> to have been awarded a pension for service. At that time, he was said to have been 62-year-old and a resident of Albany. He thus served as a private in Col. Gansevoort's regiment and was discharged at Saratoga on November 7, 1780 when his enlistment expired.

<p>Church records dated as early as 1788 identify him as a pewholder and communicant of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1025">1790</a>, the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> census configured the household of John Nehemiah" with a boy, three men, and three women. A decade later, the <a href="../../census1800.html#1025">census</a> called him "John Henry Nemire" and  noted three boys, four girls and a couple each born prior to 1756 in the same general location as in 1790. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> and in 1820, his household was a census fixture.

<p>Missing from the household in 1810 was his wife, Mary Ann, who was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch</a> church in May 1809. In March of that year, John H. and Mary sold a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lot</a> located nearby their residence but in the adjoining town of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> to <a href="../qqqq.html">one</a> James Hartness. 

<p>The assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a> valued his personal property modestly under the <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> house of widow <a href="../r/chroff.html">Christina Roff</a> - whose home was located near the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a>ern border of the city.

<p>The city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">censuses</a> for 1810 and 1820 configured his shrinking households but did not place him in a particular ward.

<p>The 1820 edition of the Albany  <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> listed John Henry Nemire as a "<a href="../../trades/leather.html">glover</a>" with an address of <a href="../../streets.html#patroon">Patroon Street</a>. Previous editions do not seem to have included him.

<p>With unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on his origins and passing we move on for now. </p>
