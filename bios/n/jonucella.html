<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Nucella</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> John Peter Nucella) is said to have supplied spiritual services to the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">congregation</a> in 1699-1700. He was more widely known a the pastor of the Reformed church in Kingston, New York.

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional resources tell us that he had been <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=idQQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA641&lpg=PA641&dq=%22Johannes+Nucella%22&source=bl&ots=jHZbNFDUAS&sig=8Hqh2ZWNPuR4Db3RHuk2NG4Dde8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDtuD1ioXPAhXJGx4KHW_jAHYQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=%22Johannes%20Nucella%22&f=false">ordained</a> by the classis of Amsterdam in the Spring of 1694. He was sent to America to serve at Kingston where he arrived in 1695.

<p>The Ulster County faithful had been without a minister since 1689 when Domine <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mlsjMujhHIcC&pg=PA208&lpg=PA208&dq=johannis+weekstein&source=bl&ots=rKTk7O02XV&sig=zbAwQ1R46js9TbY-cYL0dcRTL_w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwju66Ltu4fPAhWIth4KHVbbCfEQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=johannis%20weekstein&f=false">Johannes Weekstein</a> was dismissed for unacceptable behavior.

      <p>A not dissimilar situation existed in Albany where its long-time <a href="../d/godellius.html">pastor</a> 
        had or was about to return to Europe. Actual services probably were supplied 
        by Nucella. A new pastor had been <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rlpOAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA350&lpg=PA350&dq=nucella+rev+john+peter&source=bl&ots=9-qLQTufXX&sig=w7PQdZyL83ZNjmwUcW9WNcK8Drs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOsNTCxIfPAhVIJB4KHZyzCrYQ6AEINTAI#v=onepage&q=rev%20john%20peter%20nucella&f=false">called</a> 
        but had not yet arrived in Albany. In 1700, Nucella helped pave the way 
        for Reverend <a href="../l/jlydius4614.html">Johannes Lydius</a> to be 
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=w54lAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1471&lpg=PA1471&dq=nucella+rev+john+peter&source=bl&ots=HqJkLpR0bi&sig=pEoZir6dPRrqKCaXrfNx1c5ycOk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOsNTCxIfPAhVIJB4KHZyzCrYQ6AEIIjAC#v=onepage&q=nucella%20rev%20john%20peter&f=false">received</a> 
        as the lawful minister in Albany. 
<p>Nucella was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hdVCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=nucella+rev+john+peter&source=bl&ots=Q5kPHL6tWr&sig=TLE-YAEsiZVJ5t0e1LgEbpluhYo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOsNTCxIfPAhVIJB4KHZyzCrYQ6AEIMDAG#v=snippet&q=nucella&f=false">known</a> to fellow clerics as "a man of good report, of studious habits, of excellent gifts and godly walk." Provincial political machinations caused him some discomfort (perhaps <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=w54lAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1471&lpg=PA1471&dq=%22rev.+john+peter+nucella%22&source=bl&ots=HqJkMxR4bj&sig=-AGaHpKwx9fvgUFEwTQyRV4vJkE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5zPDI5IzPAhWEGB4KHYgECFoQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22rev.%20john%20peter%20nucella%22&f=false">innocently</a>) especially in his Albany setting. Those troubles are chronicled more closely in the most useful <a href="#sources">monograph</a> on the Albany church.

<p>His wife was named <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pe0pAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=maria+ nucella&source=bl&ots=eLKdTzgpZY&sig=3ckRtwOhZPGZw_Imv2wq_rGvcUg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjKwqCRv4zPAhVENz4KHVGMCiUQ6AEINTAH#v=onepage&q=maria+nucella&f=false">Maria</a> and has been characterized as an English woman. A number of <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=idQQAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA641&lpg=PA641&dq=%22Johannes+Nucella%22&source=bl&ots=jHZbNFDUAS&sig=8Hqh2ZWNPuR4Db3RHuk2NG4Dde8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiDtuD1ioXPAhXJGx4KHW_jAHYQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&q=%22Johannes%20Nucella%22&f=false">Nucellas</a> became Reformed church ministers. We still seek clarity on his precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>.
	  
<p>Even though, Johannes Nucella probably <a href="../../na/na.html">never</a> resided in Albany nor was he formally called to the Albany pulpit, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mWxZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22nucella+street%22+albany&source=bl&ots=GuKrtMtdIz&sig=qyKUu5ero62iYIv96lf1BXCuRtU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi8pL-dvofPAhXTPB4KHZ4-A7I4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22nucella%20street%22%20albany&f=false">Nucella Street</a> in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> was among those named for early Dutch church clerics	  
<p>Upon leaving America, Johannes Nucella is said to have settled in London "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pYguAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA440&lpg=PA440&dq=nucella+wife&source=bl&ots=kJux7cjQeH&sig=NaCENJPETT2SKbXAWniKR_OEiVk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjKwqCRv4zPAhVENz4KHVGMCiUQ6AEIQzAL#v=onepage&q=nucella%20wife&f=false">undoubtedly</a>" due to the influence of his English wife and to take charge of the "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=w54lAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1471&lpg=PA1471&dq=%22rev.+john+peter+nucella%22&source=bl&ots=HqJkMxR4bj&sig=-AGaHpKwx9fvgUFEwTQyRV4vJkE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi5zPDI5IzPAhWEGB4KHYgECFoQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22rev.%20john%20peter%20nucella%22&f=false">Dutch chapel</a>" there. He died in 1722.</p>
