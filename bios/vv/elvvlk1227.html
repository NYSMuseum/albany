<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Van Valkenburgh</b></a> was born in 1745.She was the daughter of Albany carpenter <a href="javvlk1306.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="../r/mgtradcliff1080.html">Margarita Radcliff</a> Van Valkenburgh.</p>

<p>She married newcomer <a href="../l/thlynott1147.html">Thomas Lynott</a> about 1765. The couple had two daughters before his death in 1770. She was among the beneficiaries of his estate. She then married newcomer skipper <a href="../b/abbgd7351.html">Abraham Bloodgood</a> in 1773. Over the next two decades, seven of their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>The Bloodgoods lived on the <a href="../../loc/experiment.html">Albany waterfront</a> where Abraham was among the most prominent mariners and also an innkeeper.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was a slaveholder in her own right. In 1801, she freed Diana, who was born a year earlier to her slave, Rose.</p>

<p>Abraham Bloodgood died in 1807. His will gave her control of his estate during her widowhood. After Bloodgood's passing, she moved in with her children as her name did not appear on subsequent <a href="../../sources.html#ad">lists</a> of Albany householders.</p>

<p>Elizabeth filed a will in 1822. It left her household items to her daughter Rachel. Widow Elizabeth Van Valkenburgh Lynott Bloodgood died on July 21, 1823. She had lived almost seventy-eight years.</p>
