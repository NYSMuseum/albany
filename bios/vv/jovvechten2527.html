      <P>According to <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~dflanagan/page230.html#BYE100">traditional 
        sources</>, </a><a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Van Vechten</strong></a> 
        was born in 1677. He was the son of Gerrit T. and Anna Jans Van Vechten 
        of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
      <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/jovvechten1719.jpg" align=right height=216 width=176 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="Johannes Van Vechten - 1719"></a> 
        In March 1699, he married Albany native <a href="../b/mabogardus6378.html">Maria 
        Bogardus</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1714, eight children had been christened in Albany where he had been 
        a member since 1692. 
      <p>These Van Vechtens first made their home in Albany's first ward where 
        Johannes's property was accorded a moderate <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment</a>. 
        Perhaps they took over for Maria's <a href="../b/pibogardus6381.html">father</a> 
        when he moved away from Albany a couple years after their marriage. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">1715</a>, he was identified 
        as as sergeant in Johannes Schuyler's troop of horse. 
      <p>In July 1708, Johannes expressed interest in buying a plantation in <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 
        Perhaps he was the Johannes Van Vechten who was living in Rensselarswyck 
        in <a href="http://www.genealogy-quest.com/collections/nyalby.html">1720</a> 
        or <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyalbany/pearson/A-B.html">identified</a> 
        as a resident of Schaghticoke. In October 1741, this individual transferred 
        all his <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=K_w2AQAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=sons-in-law%20&f=false">lands</a> 
        at "Hoosic" to his three sons-in-law. Presumably, those lands were in 
        the form of a leasehold. 
      <p>Two individuals named Johannes Van Vechten were <a href="../../dead.html#drc">buried</a> 
        from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html#sources">church</a> in 1734 and 
        1743. Both were interred in the burial plot located on <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html#paps">Papskanee 
        Island</a>. Thus, this short-term city resident probably died after 1741.</p>

        Vechten</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 2527. 
        This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. For his Rensselaerswyck homestead, see an online (at least 
        in 2015) essay by <a href="http://www.newyorkhistoryblog.com/2011/11/shirley-dunn-early-dutch-house.html">Shirley 
        Dunn</a>. With at least two JVVs at-risk, we are aware that we may have 
        melded the identities of several same-named individuals together. In any 
        event, this treatment lacks several essential ingredients. 
        <p>Photograph of a <a name=portrait></a><b>portrait</b> of Johannes Van 
          Vechten said to have been painted by <a href="http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/pbio?235870">Pieter

          the <a href="http://www.philamuseum.org">Philadelphia Museum of Art</a>. 
          However, at least one source has identified the sitter as the other 
          Johannes (1666-1734).
