      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick Van Vechten</strong></a> was born 
        in March 1747. He was the youngest of the seven children born to the marriage 
        of <a href="jovvechten2528.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../b/cobeekman3884.html">Neeltje 
        Beekman</a> Van Vechten. His father was dead by the time Hendrick was 
        christened. He grew up in his mother's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In May 1762, he was named as the youngest son in the <a href="../../wills/willcobeekman.html">will</a> 
        filed by his mother. Besides receiving an equal share of her estate, his 
        mother arranged for him to be apprenticed as a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a>. 
        She was dead by 1766 when he would have been nineteen. 
      <p>His adult life began earlier than for most as in 1766 and '67 his first 
        ward property was valued on the city assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#2525">1767</a>, he was a private 
        in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. In 
        <a href="../../org/cc.html#1767">1767</a>, he was appointed firemaster 
        for the first ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1772">1772</a>, he was 
        elected assistant alderman for the first ward. He was re-elected in 1773 
        and 1774. He was an active member of the city council - raveling to New 
        York and to <a href="../j/swj.html">Johnson Hall</a> on city business. 
      <p>With the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 
        1775, he supported the cause financially but declined to be appointed 
        captain of the Albany company. In 1776, he was elected and served on the 
        Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence.</a> In <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2525">1778</a>, 
        he served on the homefront under the Quartermaster. Afterwards, he received 
        a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2525">land bounty right</a> in 
        conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>Henry or Hendricus Van Vechten probably did not marry and seems to have 
        had little apparent connection to the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2525">1779</a>, his substantial 
        personal assets (probably his silver) were valued under the real property 
        holdings of his brother <a href="vovvechten2574.html">Volkert</a>. 
      <p>Hendrick Van Vechten died in August 1786 and was buried from the Dutch 
        church. In April 1787, he was identified as a silversmith when letters 
        of administration on his estate were granted to his other older brother 
        <a href="epvvechten2454.html">Ephraim</a>.</p>
