      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Van Vechten</strong></a> was born 
        in February 1735. He <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~fayfamily/auburn_cousins.html">appears</a> 
        to have been the eldest surviving son of <a href="havvechten2520.html">Harme</a> 
        and Elizabeth (<a href="../qqqq.html">V</a>an Buren) Van Vechten. His 
        father was an Albany native who was more closely connected to <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> 
        than to Albany. Perhaps, the first part of his life reflected his father's 
        dual identities as well. Moving forward, we are <a href="../../res/guess.html">cautious</a> 
        as a number of same-named individuals are at risk in greater Albany County 
        over his long lifetime. 
<p>In December 1757, Cornelis married Albany native <a href="../k/anknick.html">Anna Knickerbacker</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that 
        time, he was called a resident of Schaghticoke. By 1773, the marriage 
        had produced at least <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=stoddard2&id=I02761">ten</a> children who were christened in Albany and elsewhere 
        in Albany County. From the time of his marriage, he was a pewholder at 
        the Albany church and an occasional baptism sponsor. 
      <p>At least during this Cornelis's young adulthood, his life appears to have 
        been connected to the city of Albany. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a>, 
        he was appointed firemaster for the third ward. In <a href="../../solconst.html#2444">1766</a>, 
        he signed the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. All of the signatories 
        were city residents. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>, 
        his <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> Albany property was assessed 
        at a significant rate. He also had a lot in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">West 
        Manor</a>. During the 1760s, he witnessed a number of legal documents - probably in Albany.
		 
<p>In October 1775, he was <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nysarato/Sylvester/chap20.html">commissioned</a> 
        Lieutenant Colonel of the Eleventh or Saratoga regiment of the Albany 
        County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. He is said to have 
        served until 1781. Consequently, he was known as "Colonel Van Vechten." 
        Some of his wartime exploits and information on his home have been <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=A8YiAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22van+vechten%22+saratoga&source=web&ots=lEmOsl0HUG&sig=hPMo4Z7ybuoE-jWjV_QxV9zpz_I">chronicled</a> 
        by Benson Lossing. His family fell back to Albany when Van Vechten's "Coveville" 
        home was burned by the British in 1777. 
      <p>In October <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/saratoga/taxlists/oct1779.txt">1779</a>, 
        his Saratoga properties were valued substantially on the district assessment 
        roll. "Cornelius Van Veighton" as was identified as one of the assessors. 
      <p>In 1789-90, he represented Albany County in the State Assembly. He was 
        the clerk of town of Schaghticoke in 1794-96. 
      <p>In 1790, his household was configured under the town of Saratoga. At 
        that time, seven family members were attended by ten slaves. 
      <p>The will of Cornelis Van Vechten passed probate in November 1813. Perhaps, 
        it belonged to a younger individual of the same name. His eldest <a href="mavvechten2556.html">daughter</a> 
        married newcomer <a href="../l/enleonard.html">Enoch Leonard</a> and survived 
        in Albany and Lansingburgh until 1859.</p>
