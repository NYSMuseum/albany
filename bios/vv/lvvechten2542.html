<P><A href="#biography"><B>Lucas Van Vechten</B></A> was born in October 1724. He was the second son of the eight children born to Albany-area residents <a href="revvechten2564.html">Reuben</a> and <a href="../w/gewitbeck1795.html">Geertruy Witbeck</a> Van Vechten.</P>

<p>Losing his father in 1735, the young boy found the <a href="../../peace.html">opportunity</a> 
        to follow the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> out on the frontier. 
        By the outbreak of the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>, he 
        was an associate of <a href="#swj">William Johnson</a> and well-known 
        at outposts across British North America where he provided a number of 
        services. He also was called "Captain" - although his commission has not 
        been found! As late as 1762, he was at the head of a party receiving a 
        <a href="#toronto">trading pass</a> to Toronto.</p>

<P>Frontier trader Lucas Van Vechten also was a prominent Albany-area resident. He received negroes and other property from the estate of his uncle. By the 1760s, he had settled in Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2542">1763</a>, his name was on a list of Albany freeholders. Three years later, he joined the local protest against the Stamp Act by signing the <a href="../../solconst.html#2542">Sons of Liberty Constitution</a>. During that time he was .living in a modest home near the northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">boundary</a>  of the city. 
		
<p>Although he may have been married to a woman named Maria Lantman, none of their children appear to have been baptized in any of the <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>. He was, however, a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

      <p>Like most native sons, he served in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. 
        He was a lieutenant!</p> 
      <p>Over the next decade, Van Vechten established a more permanent home near 
        the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Patroon's house</a> in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> 
        where he formed an association with <a href="../vr/svr5114.html">Stephen 
        Van Rensselaer II</a>. At the outbreak of the War for Independence, he 
        held several lots in Albany city, property in Rensselaerswyck, and investment 
        real estate <a href="#beyond">beyond</a>.</p>

      <p>In 1775, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of 
        Correspondence</a> for Rensselaerswyck. In July, he declined a Congressional 
        appointment as Major in the Continental army. No reason was given for 
        the refusal. After 1776, he no longer attended committee meetings. In 
        1778, he was among those who were exempted from active service because 
        they were over fifty years old.</p>

<p>After the war, sixty-year-old Lucas Van Vechten settled into his Watervliet <a href="../../census1790.html#2542">home</a> where he was attended by six slaves. Managing his Albany property, he occasionally was reimbursed for expenses by the Albany city government.</p>

<p>In August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">1797</a>, a great fire destroyed a large block of the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> waterfront. Van Vechten's house and stables on <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#mont">Mont</a>gomery Street and his dwellinghouse, storehouse, and stable on <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#water">Water</a> Vliet Street were among those lost and his tenants were displaced. 

      <p>Lucas Van Vechten died in December of 1801 and was buried from the Albany Dutch 
        church where he was a life-long member. His will <a href="../../inprog.html">passed 
        probate</a> in February 1802.</p>
