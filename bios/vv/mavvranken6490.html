<strong>Maus R. Van Vranken</strong></a> was born in November 1752. He was the youngest son in the large family of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents Ryckert and Anna Truax Van Vranken.

<p>In 1774, he is said to have opened a school in the "new city" of <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>. He also agreed to read one English and one Dutch language sermon every Sunday at the church there.

<p>In February 1776, he was appointed adjutant of the newly organized <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> Battalion of the Fourth militia regiment. Later, he received a land bounty right in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment.



<p>In March 1781, he applied and was <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#6490">admitted</a> to the "Freedom" of Albany. At that time, he was identified as a merchant. 

<p>With the end of the war, he settled down in Albany and entered the dry good business. In December 1782, he <a href="../../ag.html">announced</a> his intention to open a "Shop of Goods" on the "Schoharie Road" that  would offer dry goods, Jamaica Spirits, West India Rum, Powder'd Suger, and other items and would accept "any kind of grain" in payment.  

<p>In February 1783, he married Albany native <a href="../v/geerveeder6762.html">Geertruy Veeder</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1789, three children had been christened in the church where he was a member and supporter.

<p>His <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6490">modest</a> home was located in the <a href="../../census1790.html#6490">second ward</a> (in 1813 the address was 168 <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a>). During the 1780s, he purchased additional properties within the city. He was paid by the municipal government on a number of occasions. In 1788, he was appointed justice of the peace.

<p>In April 1801, he was identified as a grocer and was charged seven dollars for a license. In 1815, the city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">Directory</a> gave his address as 35 North Market Street.

 
<p>Maus R. Van Vranken died in March 1816. He had lived almost sixty-two years.</p>
