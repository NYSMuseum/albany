<strong>Philippus Van Vechten</strong></a> was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on February 2, 1729. He was a younger son in the family of Albany residents <a href="revvechten2564.html">Reuben</a> and <a href="../w/gewitbeck1795.html">Geertruy Witbeck</a> Van Vechten. He grew up in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where his father kept a stables. Reuben Van Vechten died in 1735 leaving Geertruy to raise their large family. 

<p>However, the widow Van Vechten died ten years later - leaving Philippus either under the Van Vechten-Witbeck <a href="../../children.html">family</a> umbrella or else on his own at the age of sixteen. Although he lived several decades longer, Philippus does not appear to have married or to have raised a family. In 1754, he was identified as a pewholder at the Dutch church.

<p>In 1748, he was named to share in the estate of his uncle Johannes L. Witbeck of Rensselaerswyck. In May 1769, he was identified as the brother-in-law, heir, and <a href="../../wills/willhawendell2669.html">co-executor</a> of the estate of Harmanus Wendell.

<p>In November 1756, he was identifed as a yeoman when he <a href="../../sources.html#cw">witnessed</a> the will of widow Elizabeth Van Rensselaer. In 1760 and 1770, his accounts were paid by the Albany treasurer.

<p>In 1766 and '67, his property on the West side of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Van Rensselaer Manor</a> received moderate <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>. He probably lived north of the city - in the <a href="../../wills/willelgroesbeck3932.html">vicinity</a> of the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a>. 

<p>In 1776, he <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">signed</a> the General Association. The next year, he supported the crusade for American liberties when he swore an <a href="../../coc.html">oath</a> of secrecy. Philippus Van Vechten was last heard from in November 1778 when he was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#2558">exempted</a> from military service because of his age.</p>
