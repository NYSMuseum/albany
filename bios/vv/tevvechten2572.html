<strong>Teunis Van Vechten</strong></a> was born in November 1785. He was the son of <a href="tetvvechten2569.html">Teunis T.</a> and <a href="../d/eldewandelaer6176.html">Elizabeth De Wandelaer</a> Van Vechten. He grew up in a prominent merchant's home on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a>.

<p>He graduated from Union College, studied for the law with chancellor <a href="../l/jolansing3755.html">John Lansing, Jr.</a> and his uncle, <a href="abvvechten2378.html">Abraham Van Vechten</a>, and was admitted to practice in June 1807. He joined his uncle and later succeeded to his practice. His efforts on behalf of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> patroonship were particularly notable.

<p>In December 1810. Teunis married Catherine Gansevoort at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1830, the marriage had produced ten children.

He was a trustee and director of many Albany organizations, and an elected official (alderman for the third ward) and mayor of Albany (four terms beginning in 1837).

<p>Teunis Van Vechten lost his wife in 1831. He lived much longer and died in February 1859 at the age of seventy-three. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in March and named his four living children as heirs.</p>
