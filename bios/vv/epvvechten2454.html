<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ephraim Van Vechten</strong></a> was born in April 1743. He was the son of <a href="jovvechten2528.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../b/cobeekman3884.html">Neeltie Beekman</a> Van Vechten. He grew up in a comfortable <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
        home but lost his father at age three when Johannes Van Vechten, Jr. died 
        in December 1746. In May 1762, he was named an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willcobeekman.html">will</a> 
        filed by his mother.
		 
      <p>February 1767,he married <a href="../w/anwendell2753.html">Anna Wendell</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their only child 
        was born the following March. After Anna's death, he married the widow 
        <a href="../h/suhogan4393.html">Susanna Hogan</a> De Garmo in November 
        1774. In 1779, their daughter was christened in the church where Ephraim 
        was a member and pewholder.
		 
      <p>During the early 1760s, Ephraim Van Vechten was a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> 
        operating out of Niagara. He also was beginning to establish a permanent 
        identity in Albany by acquiring land and serving as firemaster in the 
        <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> - first in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">1763</a>. 
        Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his first 
        ward home was valued on city assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2454">rolls</a>.
		 
<p>At the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, he began to build a record of support by accepting the commission as Quartermaster of the city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. He later <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2454">served</a> as Deputy Wagon Master General. He also lent financial support and was paid by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committees</a>. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2454">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany regiment.

<p>With the coming of peace, this forty-year-old sought to establish himself as a skipper <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">or</a> mariner as his home on Court <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html#low">and</a> Hudson Streets became an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#2454">landmark</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2454">1800</a>, his household included only his wife and a younger female.

<p>In 1787, he was empowered to administer the estate of his younger <a href="hevvechten2525.html">brother</a> who was recently deceased and probably a bachelor.

<p>Ephraim Van Vechten died in November 1802 and was buried from his church. He was a few months shy of his sixtieth birthday.</p>
