<strong>Geertruy Van Vranken</strong></a> was born in October 1754. She was the daughter of <a href="gevvr.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../e/suegberts4541.html">Susanna Egberts</a> Van Vranken. She grew up with a number of sisters in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward home</a> of an Albany carpenter.

<p>In March 1779, she married newcomer soldier <a href="../g/jogates6507.html">John Gates</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1788, five children had been christened at the Albany church.

<p>This Gates family made their <a href="../../census1790.html#gevvr">home</a> in the third ward next to that of her aging parents. A decade later, her parents had passed on but their <a href="../../census1800.html#6507">household</a> included six children. Their home at 5 Van Tromp Street also housed Gates's workshop. 
 
<p>The aging couple resided in their corner house until John died in 1825. Geertruy carried on after his death for another decade and a half. In 1836, she was granted an annual pension of $240 plus arrears for his Revolutionary War service. Geertruy Van Vranken Gates lived until she was eighty-five - dying in May 1839. The widow of John Gates was buried in the Dutch church cemetery plot.</p>
