<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit Ryckse</b></a> probably was born during the mid 1670s. He was the son of pioneer farmers <a href="rycvvranken6474.html">Ryckert</a> and <a href="../r/hirycks6522.html">Hillegont</a> Van Vranken. They were early residents of Niskayuna and of Albany as well.</p>

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">T</a>raditional sources have called him a resident of <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Nistagicone</a>. However, by <a href="../../census1697.html#066">1697</a>, he was identified as an Albany resident and householder. Two years later, he signed an <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6473">oath</a> swearing allegiance to the king of England. Subsequent assessment rolls in 1702 and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6473">1709</a> valued his modest holdings in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.</p> 


<p>In September 1696, he married Barber Jans at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1715, seven children had been baptized in the church where he had been a member since 1695.</p>

Although he served as a juror, assessor, and constable in the third ward, in 1699 Gerrit Ryckse was identified and cited as one of those trading without a license - that is without the "freedom of the City." That meant he was not born in Albany and thus was obliged to apply for a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trading license</a>. 


<p>After the first decade of the eighteenth century, his name dropped from Albany city rolls. Perhaps he returned to the countryside. Gerrit Ryckse Van Vranken died in January 1748.</p>
