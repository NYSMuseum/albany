<strong>Johannes Van Vechten, Jr.</strong></a> was born in June 1709. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents <a href="vovvechten.html">Volkert</a> and <a href="../t/lytbroeck63.html">Lydia Ten Broeck</a> Van Vechten and the twin of Ephraim Van Vechten. He was called "Johannes Jr." to avoid confusion with an older <a href="jovvechten2527.html">kinsman</a> of the same name.

<p>In 1727, he was paid by the provincial government for six days of labor done at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>.

<p>In October 1734, he married Albany native <a href="../b/cobeekman3884.html">Cornelia Beekman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1747, seven children had been christened in Albany. Three of them had been buried in the church by 1746. 

<p>By <a href="../../org/cc.html#1740">1740</a>, he had settled in Albany when he was first elected assistant alderman for the first ward. He was re-elected every year until his death. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2528">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders.

 

<p>He filed a will in May 1743. Johannes Van Vechten, Jr. died in December 1746 - a few months before the birth of his last son. He was only thirty-seven years old. His will passed probate in April 1749. His widow and four sons lived at least until the end of 1766 when Neeltie's will passed probate.</p>
