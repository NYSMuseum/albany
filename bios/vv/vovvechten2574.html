<strong>Volkert Van Vechten</strong></a> was born in August 1735. He was the eldest son of <a href="jovvechten2528.html">Johannes Jr.</a> and <a href="../b/cobeekman3884.html">Neeltie Beekman</a> Van Vechten. He grew up in a mid-size family in a businessman's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. However, his father died in 1746 when Volkert was eleven years old. In May 1762, he was identified as the eldest son, co-executor, and heir in the <a href="../../wills/willcobeekman.html">will</a> filed by his mother. 

<p>In November 1762, he married <a href="../h/jahun4775.html">Jannetje Hun</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their children were christened in 1763 and 1768 at the church where both parents were members and pewholders.

<p>At that time, Volkert began to take his place in the community by serving as firemaster for the first ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1762">1762</a> and 1763. Over the next two decades, his home near that of his <a href="epvvechten2454.html">brother</a> was accorded moderate <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a>. 

<p>During the 1770s, Volkert Van Vechten contributed to the support of the American cause and participated in some community-based activities. In January 1778, he was elected to represent the first ward in the last days of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. However, that August he was among those who refused to take the oath of allegience. At that time, he was characterized as a "farmer." Afterwards, his <a href="#name">name</a> was not found on lists of those Albany residents entitled to receive land bounties for service.

<p>Volkert Van Vechten would have been forty-eight-years-old with the coming of peace in 1783. He also was a <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slaveholder</a>. During the 1780s, his slaves were getting married in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. Otherwise, his name was mostly absent from the <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2574">1788</a>, his first ward property was valued on an Albany assessment roll. Two years later, the <a href="../../census1790.html#4775">census</a> identified his widow as the head of their household which included four slaves.

<p>It seems that Volkert Van Vechten had died between 1788 and 1790.</p>
