<P>
<b>T</b>he<a href="#sources"> <strong>Van Valkenburgh</strong></a> family of early Albany is descended from New Amsterdam resident <a href="lavvlk1363.html">Lambert Van Valkenburgh</a> who brought his family to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> during the early 1650s.

<p>Lambert was included on a census of Albany householders taken in <a href="../../census1679.html#1363">1679</a>. His given name persisted through many generations of the family.

<p>Their <a href="ravvlk1399.html">daughter</a> married soldier <a href="../r/joradcliff1060.html">John Radcliff</a> and raised a large Albany-based family that established the Radcliff/Radley family in Albany and the region for generations to come. Her Albany household represented the family on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1697.html#174">1697</a>.

<p>One of her Radcliff sons was named on the list of Albany freeholders taken in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>. No Van Valkenburghs were listed. 

<p>As many as three Van Valkenburgh households were identified on the census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>. One of them belonged to carpenter and tavern-owner's son <a href="javvlk1306.html">Jacobus Van Valkenburgh</a>. His five daughters <a href="../../marriages.html#daughters">married</a> newcomers who made important contributions to Albany life during the era of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>.


<p>By 1790, no Van Valkenburgh-named households were listed on the census for the city of Albany. Only <a href="../../census1790.html#vvlk">Jochem Van Volkenburgh</a> was named on the Watervliet census. By that time, the Van Valkenburgh family was becoming well-established in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> and beyond!</p>
