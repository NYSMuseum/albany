<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Jacobus Van Vorst</strong></a> was born in 1641. He <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/ga4/myhayes_family/f_1e.html">probably</a> was the second son of Gerrit and Geertruy Jacobs Van Vorst. He may have been born after his parents emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. He was sometimes referred to as "Jacob Gerritse." 

<p>In 1674, he was among those <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#6427">invited</a> to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer.

<p>We seek the name of his wife. He probably married during the 1660s as his son, Jellis, was eleven in 1681 when he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA529&lpg=PA529&dq=%22van+vorst%22+albany&source=bl&ots=9NcSFSbGXG&sig=ghJ9Uamm6HvBxCfHQvDtnfNBtdk&hl=en&ei=5JDdS-_6LIS69QSqrP2xBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAcQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22van%20vorst%22%20albany&f=false">apprenticed</a> to a shoemaker. Jacobus was a supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.


<p>He had settled in Albany by <a href="../../census1679.html#6427">1679</a> when he was identified as a householder. 


<p>During the mid-1680s, he was appointed city porter and was a licenced carman in Albany. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#later">January 1687</a>, he exchanged his house and lot in Albany with <a href="../q/piq.html">Pieter Quackenbush</a> for Pieter's house, shed, and land in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck. He also paid Quackenbush "twenty beavers."

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#084">1697</a>, his Albany household consisted of two men. In  <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6427">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England.

<p>After 1699, the name of Jacobus Van Vorst dropped from the Albany record. Jellis Van Vorst became a resident of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</p>
