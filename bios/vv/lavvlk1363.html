      <P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> 
        <strong>Lambert Van Valkenburgh</strong></a> was from "Valkenburg" Holland. 
        He probably was born about 1620. 
      <p>In 1642, he married Anna Jacobs in Amsterdam. A few years later, they 
        emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and raised a 
        family. Their children were christened in New Amsterdam during the 1640s 
        and 50s. In 1645,he purchased a house on Manhattan. By the early 1650s, 
        he had settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. 
      <p>During the 1650s, he was called a sergeant at the fort and was appointed 
        to the Beverwyck watch. In <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#1363">1660</a>, 
        he was among the fur traders petitioning the court for permission to go 
        into the woods to trade with the Indians. During that time, he appeared 
        regularly before the <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">court</a> on a variety 
        of matters. 
      <p>His Beverwyck home was on the <a href="ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> 
        of the community near the Dutch church <a href="../../dead.html#drc">burying 
        ground</a>. His house was <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to be located 
        on the west corner of Green and Beaver Streets. In <a href="../../census1679.html#1363">1679</a>, 
        he was listed on a census of Albany householders. 
      <p>Lambert Van Valkenburgh was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> and subscribed for the minister's salary as late as 1683. He 
        was not living in 1697. His widow is <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/vanvalkenburgh.html">said</a> 
        to have died in 1704. </p>
