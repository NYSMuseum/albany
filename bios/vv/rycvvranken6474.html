<strong>Ryckert Claese Van Vranken</strong></a> was born about 1630. He probably came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> as a young man. He was known widely as "Ryckert Claese."

<p>During the 1660s, he was a partner in some farmland at 
<a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a>. In 1679, his name was included on a census of <a href="../../census1679.html#70">Albany householders</a>. During the third quarter of the century, he bought and sold parcels of land in and around Albany.

<p>He probably was married to <a href="../r/hirycks6522.html">Hillegont Ryckse</a>. They were the parents of several sons and a daughter.

<p>Ryckert Claese Van Vranken was dead by 1697 when his widow was <a href="../../census1697.html#167">identified</a> as the head of their Albany household.</p>
