<P>According to family-based resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Van Vechten</strong></a> was born in July 1786. He was the son of <a href="abvvechten2378.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../s/caschuyler1249.html">Catharine Schuyler</a> Van Vechten. He may have been born while his father was residing and practicing law in the Mohawk Valley. But this eldest son in what would become the large family of an eminent Albany attorney and jurist came of age after his father relocated to Albany during the 1790s.

<p>Subsequent court <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=lm5UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA27&lpg=PA27&dq=%22philip+van+vechten%22&source=bl&ots=vnUoW-JRyQ&sig=d93jz2j_pt3eOiIlMn2sVGIzlLo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwizhaLqxKLNAhWm3YMKHVBpDNEQ6AEIUzAP#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20van%20vechten%22&f=false">documents identified</a> him as present during the notorious assault case involving (among others) <a href="../vr/solvr5113.html">So</a>lomon Van Rensselaer and <a href="../j/eljenkins.html">El</a>isha Jenkins on an Albany street in 
April 1807.

<p>In June 1809, he was one of the young Federalists who "<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA406&lpg=PA406&dq=%22philip+van+vechten%22+lovett&source=bl&ots=GyMeshqZah&sig=1fNRi1aKfiAiUDEoiNyeckEomZA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiax42zrqDNAhVl7YMKHSOlBowQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20van%20vechten%22%20lovett&f=false">delivered an address</a> with the news the embargo was raised, an occasion of restoration harmony [sic] and renewal of commerce with Great Britain." In the years that followed, his presentations on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/committee-arrangement-celebrating-anniversary-independence/dp/B0008BJJ0S/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1465741287&sr=1-2&refinements=p_27%3APhilip+Van+Vechten">additional topics</a> would be issued by Albany printers. 

<p>We have <a href="../../res/guess.html">inferred</a> that he followed his father in the <a href="../../trades/law.html">legal</a> profession but have not identified his training nor the particulars of what would have been a brief career. Perhaps he was educated at Union College (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=M63OAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=%22philip+van+vechten%22+union&source=bl&ots=r7ZOFSDJX_&sig=7I2PxelisHt853UwHadYU64bZFI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiIy9Tq1qLNAhWJ7SYKHSRVBHUQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20van%20vechten%22%20union&f=false">A.M. 1804</a>). Also, he does not appear to have married.

<p>In 1809, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">personal property</A> was assessed under the Market Street home of his father.

      <p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22van+vechten+philip%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22van%20vechten%20philip%22&f=false">1813</a>, 
        the first city directory identified him as a counselor living at 2 Market 
        Street - the same address as his famous father. That source also listed 
        Philip as an assistant alderman for the third ward. 
      <p>Philip Van Vechten died in February 1814. He was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=%22philip+van+vechten%22+albany&source=bl&ots=SrbtVLzjyh&sig=lFua1GRvG0Pibg1IynBhk-ZMAVo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiOr8mYpqDNAhUH_4MKHS5aDHU4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20van%20vechten%22%20albany&f=false">buried</a> in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> plot. He had lived but 27 years. Later, his stone <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=95954788">was relocated</a> to <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.</p>
