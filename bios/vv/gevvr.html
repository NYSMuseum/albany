      <P>Several individuals christened <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit Van 
        Vranken</strong></a> were born during the first decades of the eighteenth 
        century to Van Vranken parents in Albany, Schenectady, and in-between. 
        At this <a href="../../inprog.html">point</a>, we are considering several 
        individuals who became the Albany resident whose profile follows. 
      <p>At this <a href="../../inprog.html">point</a>, we are uncertain as to 
        the identity of his wife or their children. However, we do believe that 
        he <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> and raised an Albany family. 
        Perhaps his wife was <a href="../e/suegberts4541.html">Susanna Egberts</a> 
        whose marriage to "Gerrit Van Vranken produced five daughters between 
        1746 and 1758 who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where Susanna, the wife of Gerrit Van Vranken, was a pewholder. 
      <p>In November 1762, an Albany carpenter named "Gerritt Van Vrankie" was 
        left a substantial bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willjavisscher4138.html">will</a> 
        of his third ward neighbor, <a href="../v/javisscher4138.html">Jacob Visscher</a>. 
      <p>Over then next three decades, his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">holdings</a> 
        were valued on Albany assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#gevvr">rolls</a>. 
        His name appeared on the first Federal census in <a href="../../census1790.html#gevvr">1790</a> when his household consisted of only an adult couple. 
 
<p>His name was included on a <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#gevvr">list</a> 
        of Albany freeholders in 1763. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1763">that 
        year</a>, he was named firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. Over the next two decades, his accounts frequently were paid 
        by the city <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a>. 
      <p>Gerrit Van Vranken was last heard from in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, 
        when he was identified as a carpenter and freeholder living in the third 
        ward. Later [<a href="https://ia601407.us.archive.org/17/items/annalsofalbany04munsuoft/annalsofalbany04munsuoft_bw.pdf">perhaps</a> 
        (see p. 326) in late 1803], the Albany paper <a href="../../doc/nn3.html#gevvr">reported</a> 
        that he had died at the age of 97.</p>
