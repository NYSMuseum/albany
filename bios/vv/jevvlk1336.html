      <P>According to family based sources, <a href="#sources">Jac</a>omyntie (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> 
        Jemima) Van Valkenburgh was born in September 1775 and christened at the 
        Dutch church in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. Thus, she 
        would have been the daughter of Kinderhook area residents Abraham and 
        Cornelia Ten Eyck Van Valkenburgh. Perhaps she had but one sibling. 
      <p>In December 1797, she married <a href="../h/behilton.html">Benjamin Hilton</a> at the Dutch church in Kinderhook. By 1802, the first two of their children had been christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. Subsequent baptisms were recorded in Kinderhook.

<p>Following her marriage, these Hiltons <a href="../../census1800.html#behi">lived</a> briefly in Albany where Benjamin appears to have been a grocer. But the end of the first decade of the 1800s, they had returned to Kinderhook their home for the remainder of their lives

<p>Jacomyntie (Jemima) Van Valkenburgh, "wife of Benjamin Hilton," died at Kinderhook in September 1826. She had lived for fifty-one years. Her locally prominent husband may have lived somewhat longer.</p>
