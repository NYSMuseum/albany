      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anthony Van Vechten</strong></a> was born in January 
        1748. He was the son of <a href="../b/anbogardus2387.html">Anna Bogardus</a> 
        and the "gravely ill" Albany taylor <a href="bevvechten2393.html">Benjamin 
        Van Vechten</a>. His father died the following August. He was known as 
        "Anthony" <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> "Antony" but apparently not 
        as "<a href="tetvvechten2569.html">Teunis/Tunis</a>" - the name of contemporary 
        kinsmen. 
      <p>After five years, his widowed mother remarried and brought him to the 
        third ward home of an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#319">mainliner</a> 
        and to a marriage that would produce several additional children. His mother appears to have survived until 1787.
		
<p>As Anthony was the only surviving child, his father's <a href="../../wills/willbevvechten.html">will</a> 
        eventually bestowed on him about half of the estate. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, 
        his house and property was valued on an Albany assessment roll. In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#2392">1767</a>, 
        he was identified as a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.
<p>He is <a href="http://www.fonda.org/files/Fonda_Oct15.pdf">said</a> to 
        have married <a href="../f/mavfonda.html">Maria Fonda</a> at the Dutch 
        church in Stone Arabia in April 1770. In November 1771, their son was 
        christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At 
        least seven more children followed but they were baptized in Stone Arabia. 
      <P>After 1771, his name dropped from Albany rolls. It appears that following his 
        marriage to a daughter of <a href="http://library.nysha.org/special_collections/wp/?page_id=80">Jellis 
        Fonda</a>, he relocated to the Mohawk Valley, became a prominent patriot 
        officer in Tryon County, and was living in Caughnawaga in <a href="https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XHKG-LQM">1790</a>. 
        We have <a href="../../na/na.html">not actively</a> followed his life 
        after his time in Albany. 
      <p><a href="http://www.biblerecords.com/mount1.html#112">Thus</a>, he would 
        have been the Anthony Van Vechten who died October 14, 1812 in "the 68th 
        year of his age." That individual had a forty-eight-year-old son named 
        Benjamin. Perhaps Anthony had lost his wife in 1800 when Mary Van Vechten 
        was buried near him in June.</p>
