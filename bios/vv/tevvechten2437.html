<strong>Teunis Cornelise</strong></a> was born during the early 1600s. He may have been the patriarch of the Van Vechten family of early Albany and its environs. <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us he was from Breucklen in Holland and came to New Netherland during the 1630s to work for the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Van Rensselaers</a>. 

<p>He was known as a shoemaker but also supervised a number of tenant farmers.

<p>During the 1640s, he received support from the deacons of the <a href+'../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>By the 1650s, he had gravitated to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where served as a magistrate.

<p>We believe that he was married and the father of a number of children.

<p>We must be cautious here as frequent opportunity exists for confusing the life of Teunis Cornelise Van Vechten with that of his prominent contemporary, <a href="../vd/tevdp6272.html">Teunis Cornelise Vanderpoel</a>! In fact, we are stopped cold by an individual called "Teunis Dirckse Van Vechten." This sketch appears as a cry for help in sorting out the life of this <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer. </p>
