<strong>Margarita Van Vranken</strong></a> was born in July 1748. She was the daughter of Albany-area residents Ryckert and Anna Truax Van Vranken. Her mother appears to have <a href="http://brideindex.info/t-surnames/truax.html">died</a> in 1755.

<p>In November 1771, she married <a href="../w/hewaldron662.html">Hendrick Waldron</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Both were identified as of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">the colony</a> By the 1790s, as many as nine children had been <a href="http://www.google.com/books?pg=RA3-PA183&id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ#v=onepage&q=&f=false">christened</a> in Albany area churches.

<p>These Waldrons probably lived in the part of Rensselaerswyck (West Manor) that became known as Guilderland. By the 1790s, they were receiving services from the Heldeberg Reformed church.

<p>In May 1786, she was identified as the wife of Waldron in the <a href="../../sources.html#en">will</a> filed by her father, a resident of the West Manor.

<p>Beyond church information, little mention of her has been found in the Albany-based communtiy record. We seek information on the later life and passing of Margarita Van Vranken Waldron
