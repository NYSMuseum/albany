<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelis Teunise Van Vechten</b></a> was born about 1640. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="tevvechten2437.html">Teunis Van Vechten</a>.</p>


<p>In 1668, he was identified as the husband of <a href="../g/sagoewy5161.html">Sara Salomons Goewy</a>. That marriage produced at least two (and maybe four) children.</p> Van Vechten was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and an occasional baptism sponsor. In June 1689, the church recorded his marriage to the Widow Maria Lucasz. At that time, he was called the widower of Anna Leenderts - ostensibly meaning he was embarking on a third marriage!<p></p>

<p>Although connected to Albany activities, Cornelis Teunise was listed as a farmer in <a href="../vb/mgvb6656.html">Captain Gerritse's</a> company in <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">1689</a>. He was identified as a resident householder in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> on the census taken in <a href="../../census1697.html#2449">1697</a>.</p> 



<p>In December 1697, he was accused of running over Colonel Schuyler's daughter. His brother claimed it was an accident. Cornelis Teunise Van Vechten joined his Albany neighbors in signing a petition in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1701pe">1701</a>.

<p>In March <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lY1YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA14&lpg=PA14&dq=%22cornelis+teunise+van+vechten%22&source=bl&ots=uR-MvFMYvN&sig=SF84-yNzFnLPO3bLn6HkvexdK9w&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qg40U-KKKMXvoASl1oLwAg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20teunise%20van%20vechten%22&f=false">1705</a>, he was identified as a yeoman of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> when his attorney sued a neighbor for an old debt.  It was the last recorded reference to him found to date!</p>
