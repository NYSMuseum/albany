      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Teunis T. Van Vechten</strong></a> was born 
        about 1749. He was the son of Teunis and Judith Ten Broeck Van Vechten 
        of Catskill. He was the older brother of Albany jurist <a href="abvvechten2378.html">Abraham 
        Van Vechten</a>. 
<p>His wife was <a href="../d/eldewandelaer6176.html">Elizabeth De Wandelaer</a>. 
        Between 1777 and 1788, five children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a member and member of the church Consistory. 
<p>Starting out as a <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2569">boarder</a> in a third ward home, Teunis T. Van Vechten came to live in a <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2569">small house</a> at what became 333 <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html"> North Market Street</a> - an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#2569">landmark</a> for many years. He was a merchant, property owner, and community leader. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1775">1775</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the third ward and served again in 1788 and 1791. 

<p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he was serving as an ensign on 
        the third ward watch. He also served as an officer in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        regiment</a>. In 1776, he was elected to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a>. He also served in the Quartermaster Department 
        under General <a href="../l/morlewis.html">Morgan Lewis</a>. In August 
        1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2569">identified</a> an Assistant 
        QMG at Albany. Later, he received a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty 
        right</a> for service in conjunction with the city militia regiment. 

<p>After the war, he augmented his real property holdings and expanded his business to include importing and paint sales. He also was involved in a number of civic projects. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a>, he was identified as a "gentleman." 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22teunis+t%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22teunis%20t%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed him at 107 Market Street. By that time, his small, traditional <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">home</a> was dwarfed by grander buildings representing the new Albany of the nineteenth century.

<p>Teunis T. Van Vechten died in December 1817. His will was probated in January 1818. He had lived sixty-eight years. His widow survived until 1831.</p>
