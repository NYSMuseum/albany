      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Benjamin Van Vechten</strong></a> was born 
        in September 1720. He was the son of <a href="divvechten.html">Dirck C.</a> 
        and <a href="../l/mgtlievers.html">Margarita Lieverse</a> Van Vechten. 
        He probably spent most of his childhood on his father's farm at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 
      <p>His wife was <a href="../b/anbogardus2387.html">Anna Bogardus</a>. In 
        1745 and 1748, their children were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1744">1744</a>, he was appointed constable 
        for the third ward. In 1748, he identified himself as a "merchant tailor." 
        It appears that he lived with his mother but owned other <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        property</a> as well. 
      <p>Benjamin Van Vechten filed a <a href="../../wills/willbevvechten.html">will</a> 
        in April 1748. It stated that he was "very sick." It named his wife, son, 
        and mother as his heirs. He died in August 1749. He had not reached his 
        twenty-ninth birthday. His widow remarried in 1753 and lived until 1787.</p>
