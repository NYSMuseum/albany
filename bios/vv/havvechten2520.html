<strong>Harme Van Vechten</strong></a> was born in February 1704. He was the son of <a href="divvechten.html">Dirck C.</a> and <a href="../l/mgtlievers.html">Margarita Lievers</a> Van Vechten. By 1710, his family had re-located to <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> where his father operated a farm and sawmill. 


<p>About 1728, he married Elizabeth Van Vechten. By 1741, six of their children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Several of those children were buried through the church during the 1730s and 40s.

<p>Harme Van Vechten appears to have been at least a sometime <a href="../../criteria.html">Albany resident</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1732">1732</a>, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the third ward. He also appears to have held land at Schaghticoke and to have followed his father as a woodcutter and at the sawmill.


<p>Harme Van Vechten was buried by the church in April 1746. However, he was mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willbevvechten.html">will</a> filed by his brother in 1748.</p>
