<P>Known <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jannetje Segers Van Voorhout Schermerhorn</strong></a>, Jannetje was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="covvoor.html">Cornelis Segers Van Voorhout</a> and his wife <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Breetje Jacobs. The family <a href="../../newcomers.html">emigrated</a> to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in 1643 when an often utilized <a href="covvoor.html#vrbm">resource</a> specified the ages of their six living children. At that time, Jannetje was said to have been ten years old. Thus, she probably was born in Europe about 1633.

<p>Jannetje was the wife of American patriarch <a href="../s/jajscher5448.html">Jacob Janse Schermerhorn</a>. Beginning in 1652, the marriage produced at least nine children. Although all of her children were born prior to surviving Baptism records, from the earliest, she was identified as a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>These Schermerhorns would raise their family in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and afterwards <a href="../../census1679.html#5448">Albany</a> and posssibly also on the Manor and in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where Jacob Janse was an <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">substantial landholder</a>.

<p>In 1663, she was named in the <a href="https://archive.org/stream/calendarwillson00appegoog#page/n468/mode/1up">joint will</a> filed by her parents and identified as the wife of Jacob Schermerhorn.

<p>In May 1688, she was <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html#wife">named</a> as the principal heir (and sole executrix during widowhood) in the <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">will</a> filed by her husband. He died shortly thereafter.

<p>By the end of the century, widow Schermerhorn probably was absorbed in the households of her many surviving children. Jannetje Segers Van Voorhout Schermerhorn is said to have died about 1700.</p>
