<strong>Philip Van Vechten </strong></a> probably was born during the 1680s. He was not named in the baptismal records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> although he was married there and was an occasional baptism sponsor there between 1717 and 1724. <a href="../../res/ts.html#">Perhaps</a> he was the child of Michel Dirckse and Maria Parker Van Vechten who was presented for baptism in 1687. 

<p>In June 1714, he married <a href="../vd/engvdu.html">Engeltie Van Deusen</a> at the Albany church. None of their children were recorded in the baptismal records of the Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 

<p>These Van Vechtens made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>  where Philip was appointed firemaster first in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1717">1717</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2557">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. 

<p>Philip Van Vechten was last mentioned at the burial of his wife in March 1734.</p>
