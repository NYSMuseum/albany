      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Abraham Van Vechten</b></a> was born in December 
        1762. He was the youngest son of Teunis and Judike Ten Broeck Van Vechten 
        of Catskill. His older brother, <a href="tetvvechten2569.html">Teunis T. Van Vechten</a>, also became a resident of 
        Albany.</p>
      <p>Abraham Van Vechten received a basic education in Esopus. He was a schoolmate 
        and lifelong friend of <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer, 
        III</a>. He then attended Columbia College. Afterwards, he clerked at 
        the Albany law office of <a href="../l/jolansing3755.html">John Lansing, 
        Jr</a>. He then moved to the Mohawk Valley and began to practice law. 
        He quickly gained repute in the handling of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        estate</a> matters and in Federalist politics. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his household 
        was configured on the census for the town of Caughnawaga.
		 
      <p>In May 1784, he married <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> 
        resident <a href="../s/caschuyler1249.html">Catharina Schuyler</a> at 
        the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage may have produced as many as fifteen 
        children! Both parents were members and pewholders at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. As late as <a href="../../doc/sl1825drc.html">1825</a>, he pledged a substantial sum toward the future of religious higher education.</p>
		
   <p>In 1788, he began a long association with the Albany government when 
        he was retained by the city to take action against squatters on the city's 
        <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a> lands.</p>
		
      <p><a href="../../census1800.html#2378">Settling</a> in Albany during the 1790s, 
        over the next three decades he developed an extensive legal practice. 
        He trained many attorneys including his nephew and prot&eacute;g&eacute;, 
        <a href="tevvechten2572.html">Teunis Van Vechten</a>. His house on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
        Street</a> was a center of legal business in Albany for many years. One 
        of his students <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bio23.htm#">recalled</a> 
        his training under Van Vechten and lifelong association with his mentor.
		
<p><a href="#bust"><img src="../../images/jpg/abvvechten.jpg" align=left border=0 width=200 alt="Bust of Abraham Van Vechten"></a>At the same time, he held a number of public offices including that of city recorder (1797-1808), State senator, member of the New York State Assembly, and Attorney General - first in 1810. In 1792, he was elected one of the first directors of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>. This <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city father</a> belonged to and served as an officer of a number of community organizations.

<p>Beginning in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22van+vechten+abraham%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22van%20vechten%20abraham%22&f=false">1813</a>, the city directory identified him as the Attorney General with a residence at 3 Market Street (near the northern boundary of the city). At that time, eight VAn Vechten households were listed in the first directory - four were identified as "counsellors."

<p>Contemporary observer <a href="../w/goworth.html">Gorham Worth</a> also <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=V5UPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22abraham+van+vechten%22&source=bl&ots=Py7R4cAlTe&sig=BuMpW-WuOADtnZ7XQOW9jHxfSmo&hl=en&ei=Zn8yS_q4FszIlAfzl-SlBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20van%20vechten%22&f=false">profiled and praised</a> the jurist.

<p>Catharina Schuyler Van Vechten died in 1820. Abraham Van Vechten died in January 1837 at the age of seventy-four. His obituary appeared in papers far beyond Albany. This <a href="http://theoldentimes.com/abrahamvanvechten37ny.html">one</a> from Newark, New Jersey "Suddenly at his residence in Albany, Abraham Van Vechten, in the 75th year of his age. Pure, enlightened, and patriotic, he lived respected, and his memory is blessed. He was one of the fathers of the N. Y. Bar." His <a href="../../wills/willabvvechten.html">will</a> (written four years earlier) passed probate at the end of January. His <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=92401966">gravestone</a> resides at <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>. </p>
