<strong>Dirck C. Van Vechten</strong></a> probably was born about 1680. He probably was the son of Albany-area residents <a href="cotvvechten2449.html">Cornelis T.</a> and his first wife, <a href="../g/sagoewy5161.html">Sara Goewy</a> Van Vechten.

<p>In December 1703, he married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> resident <a href="../l/mgtlievers.html">Margarita Lievers</a> (Lewis) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1720, seven children were christened in Albany.

<p>Shortly after his marriage, Dirck Cornelise began to acquire properties at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. His family was living there by 1720 when he was <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">identified</a> as a Schaghticoke freeholder. He appears to have been a Schaghticoke-based tenant of the city of Albany for most of his adult life. He held water rights on the Tomhannock and operated a sawmill.   

<p>Dirck C. Van Vechten filed a will in August 1739. He was dead by October 1752 when the will passed probate. In any event, he had lived less than fifty years. Several of his <a href="bevvechten2393.html">children</a> became Albany residents.</p>
