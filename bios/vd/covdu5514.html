      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Van Deusen</strong></a> probably 
        was born during the 1720s. He probably was a member of one of the Van 
        Deusen branches spread out in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a>. 
      <p>By 1752, he had married <a href="../o/leostrander.html">Lea Ostrander</a>. 
        By 1771, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>In June 1755, his name appeared on Albany rolls when he agreed to open 
        and shut the city gates. He was on the Albany payroll the following January. 
      <p>In March 1761, he was <a href="../../wills/willcoblo1464.html">named</a> 
        co-executor of the estate of his wife's uncle. 
      <p>Beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his 
        second ward house and property were accorded the most modest of assessments. 
        In 1767, he was identified as a sergeant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. During the 1780s, he was called a "watchman," had charge 
        of the "town bulls," and was paid by the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city</a> 
        on a number of occasions in a variety of ways. 
      <p>By the end of the 1780s, the name of Cornelis Van Deusen had dropped 
        from Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">rolls</a>. His name does not appear 
        to have been included on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census of 
        1790</a> anywhere in New York State. One <a href="../../res/ts.html">source</a> 
        noted that he died in 1792.</p>
