      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Wynant Vanderpoel</strong></a> was christened 
        in October 1683. He was the son of <a href="mewvdp.html">Melgert</a> Vanderpoel 
        and his first wife, Ariaantie <a href="../vp/vplanck.html">Verplanck</a> 
        Vanderpoel. He grew up in the mainline Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#142">home</a> 
        of a tradesman/trader in a large combined family but lost his father before 
        1710. 
      <p>In 1704, he joined in an expedition against French privateers. In 1715, 
        he was <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#6277">identified</a> as a 
        private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. 
      <p>In September 1706, he married Ulster County native <a href="../d/cadhooges.html">Catharina 
        De Hooges</a> in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1722, nine children had been christened at the Albany church. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6277">1709</a>, his second ward 
        Albany property received a modest assessment. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6277">1720</a>, 
        his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders in the first ward. In 
        that year, he purchased a small lot in front of his house from the city 
        government. 
      <p>At some point thereafter - possibly as early as the late 1720s, these 
        Vanderpoels moved away and <a href="../../inprog.html">appear</a> to have 
        relocated in New Jersey where they <a href="http://www.greenapple.com/~cshart/SR1727-1729.html">witnessed</a> 
        a baptism in July 1729. 
      <p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, Catharina 
        De Hooges Vanderpoel died in 1744. Wynant Vanderpoel died in April 1750 
        and was buried in the old churchyard in Newark, New Jersey.</p>
