<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Vanderheyden</strong></a> was born in September 1733. She was the daughter of <a href="jovdh5697.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="ravdh5707.html">Rachel Vanderheyden</a> Vanderheyden. She was a middle child in the large family of a prominent businessman and attorney.

<p>Maria Vanderheyden may have been married to newcomer <a href="#jw">Ja</a>mes Wilson as a daughter named Rachel was christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> with Wilson and Maria as the parents.

<p>In March 1771, she was named as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjovdh5697.html">will</a> filed by her ailing father. Her mother had been dead since 1754 and her father died at the end of July 1771. However, no mention of Wilson or any other husband was made in the will abstract.

<p>That was the last reference to Maria Vanderheyden encountered thus far. With many un-answered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, at this time we must step back from the life of this native of early Albany.
