<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Debora Van Dam</B></A> was born about 1670, the daughter of Albany carpenter <a href="crvdam6352.html">Claes Ripse</a> and Maria Bords Van Dam. Their family was small and she was left without siblings when her only brother was sent to New York for business training.</P>

          <p>With no sisters, the dowry of a carpenter's daughter was larger than usual. 
            Consequently, Debora was able to marry well. In 1692, she wed upwardly 
            mobile <a href="../h/hehansen4939.html">Hendrick Hansen</a> in the 
            Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> where the couple 
            remained lifelong members. As the Van Dam family passed from Albany 
            rolls following the death of her parents, Debora's life became more 
            closely tied to the more numerous Hansens. The couple settled into 
            the Hansen house on Market Street where they raised seven children. 
          </P>

<p>Hendrick Hansen was a <a href="../../census1697.html#057">prominent</a> trader, landholder, 
            and <a href="../../cityfathers.html">public official</a> who was appointed 
            mayor of Albany in 1698. He later served several terms in the provincial 
            assembly. Official and personal business often took him to New York 
            leaving Debora to manage the Albany home and their young children. 
            Successful and prominent, Hansen was able to shower extensive resources 
            on his family.</p>

<p>Debora's husband died in 1724. Hansen's <a href="../../wills/willhehansen4939.html">will</a> left her the use of his estate during her widowhood. She lived on in Albany until her death in November 1742. She was buried beneath the Dutch Church.</p>
