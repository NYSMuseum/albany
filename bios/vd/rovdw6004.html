<P><a href="#sources"><b>Roeloff Gerritse</b></a> probably was born during the 1640s. His father's name probably was Gerrit - a pioneer settler of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>.</p>

<p>In 1677, Roeloff Gerritse Vanderwerken had a farm at Halfmoon on Cohoes Island. In 1683, he lived outside Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north gate</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#6004">1689</a>, a local assessment roll identified him as a farmer in Marte Gerritse's company. The census of <a href="../../census1697.html#018">1697</a>, identified him as a resident of the city of Albany. At that time, his household included a wife and six children.</p>


<p>His wife was Geetruy Jacobs. By 1693, nine of their children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member.</p>

<p>Roeloff Gerritse Vanderwerken joined his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6004">1699</a> and again in 1701. In 1703, however, he was appointed "pathmaster" for <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Half Moon</a>. Perhaps he was the individual named on a list of Halfmoon <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html#1720">freeholders</a> in 1720.</p>
