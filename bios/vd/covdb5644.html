<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Willemse</strong></a> was born about 1679. He was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="wgvdb5641.html">Willem Gysbertse</a> and <a href="cavdp.html">Catharina Vanderpoel</a> Vandenbergh. He grew up learning the jobs held by his father as cartman and husbandman.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5644">1699</a>, he joined with his neighbors in pledging loyalty to the king of England. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his  <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> property was accorded a modest assessment. In 1705, he was cited by the Albany government for not paving in front of his house. Like his father, he seems to have earned his living as a cartman and from performing varied services. He also bought and sold <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> in Albany and its environs.  


<p>In July 1701, he married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> native <a href="../w/mawinne3008.html">Maria Winne</a>. Over the next six years, the marriage produced several children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
 
<p>In November 1705, he was "weak of body" when he made his <a href="../../wills/willcowvdb.html">will</a>. Identifying himself as a carman and millwright, he left substantial property to his wife along with instructions on the raising of their children. He was dead by May 1713 when his will passed probate. His widow re-married.
