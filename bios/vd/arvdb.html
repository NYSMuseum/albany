<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Arent Vandenbergh </strong></a> was in Beverwyck and Albany from the 1650s into the 1670s. He may (or <a href="../qqqq.html">maybe</a> not) have been a member of the larger <a href="vdb.html">Vandenbergh</a> family of early Albany and beyond.

<p>He is said to have come to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> in 1654 and to have served as a corporal at <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>.

<p>In May 1661, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA368&lpg=PA368&dq=%22arent+vandenbergh%22&source=bl&ots=-Yz6z1JZcr&sig=ABzOantNgAFEoM-y29lzJvrjXTQ&hl=en&ei=NAZsTJmqLoKclgei66nmDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22arent%20vandenbergh%22&f=false">leased</a> a lot in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> (behind the fort).

<p>By the mid 1660s, he was known as a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> and master tailor who employed a journeyman tailor in 1674. He also was involved in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> and in June 1677 was <a href="../../sources.html#cma">charged</a> by the sheriff with illegally employing an Indian as a broker.

<p>His wife was known as "Maria Arents" and is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been the sister of Andries Hendrickse. Only their <a href="covdb5640.html">daughter</a> appears to have made a life in Albany as an adult. Widow Maria is said to still have been alive in 1714.

<p>He lived in and owned a house and lot (perhaps in more than one location) in Albany and its predecessor. His house on the hill was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#rpr">referenced</a> as late as December 1678. 
<p>Arent Vandenbergh was dead by March 1679 when his widow <a href="../../sources.html#era">granted</a> a power of attorney to her son-in-law, <a href="../g/jogilbert5155.html">John Gilbert</a>. In 1681, Gilbert was living in Arent's house located on the west side of Pearl Street - north of Maiden Lane.</p>

<p>We are <a href="../qqqq.html">not</a> at all certain about this individual's connection to the larger and more spread out Albany Vandenbergh family. This sketch compiles and consolidates available information on a heretofore obscure (yet fundamental) first-generation American.
