<P>At least three individuals each <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a>d <a href="#sources"> <strong>Wynant Vandenbergh</strong></a> lived in Albany and its environs during the last quarter of the eighteenth century. All three were married and raised families. Correctly assigning qualitative information requires <a href="../qqqq.html">patience</a>. This compilation is intended as a <b>first step</b> in separating out the Wynant(s) who lived in the city of Albany.

<p>A Wynant W. Vandenbergh (<a href="../../guide/histres.html#marr">id</a>entified as a gentleman of the city of Albany) married <a href="../d/madridder.html">Maria De Ridder</a> in 1759. Their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1761 and 1774. Perhaps he was the Wynant whose property was valued on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment roll</a> for Halfmoon in 1766. In December 1770, his property in the third ward was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willahroseboom1533.html">will</a> filed by Albany resident <a href="../r/ahroseboom1533.html">Ahasuerus Roseboom</a>. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=12 height=10 alt="biography in-progress"></a> By 1790, that individual (probably born before 1740) no longer appeared on community-based rolls.

<p>However, two younger Wynants were listed on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>. One was a <a href="../../census1800.html#wyvdb2">resident</a> of the second ward who also was assessed on tax rolls and on a freeholder's list in 1797. The <a href="../../census1800.html#wyvdbw">household</a> of a <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet Wynant included four children under ten and also was configured ("Vinant Vandeburgh") on the Watervliet census in <a href="../../census1790.html#wyvdbw">1790</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wyvdb">1788</a>, one of the above-mentioned Wynants probably was living in the third ward house of a family member. Additional information for Wynant Vandenbergh has been uncovered but does not seem to relate to any particular individual. 

<p>To avoid possibly confusing these individuals further, we must move on from the late eighteenth century Wynant Vandenberghs. </p>
