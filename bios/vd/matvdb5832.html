<strong>Matthys Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in March 1690. He was the son of <a href="cogvdb5718.html">Cornelis Gysbertse</a> and his second wife, <a href="covdp6245.html">Cornelia Vanderpoel</a> Vandenbergh. He grew up in a trader's home in and on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">outskirts</a> of Albany.

<p>In 1714, he was among the eight children named as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willcogvdb.html">will</a> filed by his father.

<p>In 1715, he was listed as <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#5832">member</a> of Captain Johannes Schuyler's troop of horse.

<p>In May 1717, he married <a href="cavdu5508.html">Catharina Van Deusen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1736, ten children had been christened in Albany.
