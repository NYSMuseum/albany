<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Van Deusen</strong></a> was born in November 1747. He was the second of three sons born to <a href="jovdu5546.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../w/mawinne3012.html">Maria Winne</a> Van Deusen. He grew up a member of a small family in the home of a first ward carpenter.

<p>Perhaps he was the "Peter Van Duesen" listed on the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#5567">roster</a> of an Albany city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company in 1767.

<p>At that time, his house and holdings in the first ward were valued modestly on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5567">1779</a>, only his real property in the same vicinity was taxed.

<p>In November 1769, he married <a href="../vw/cavwie.html">Catharina (Lena) Van Wie</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. However, over the next twenty-four years, only three children appear to have been  christened at the Albany church.

<p>In his late twenties at the outbreak of hostilities, we expect to connect him to <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5567">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>After the war, he seems to have returned to the Southside of Albany where in  <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5567">1788</a>, his real property and personal holdings in that location were valued modestly. In <a href="../../census1790.html#5567">1790</a>, his first ward household included four residents.

<p>In <a href="../../doc/nn1.html#1188">November 1788</a>, the newspaper reported that Van Deusen and <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Jacob Van De Bilt" had opened a "soap and candle factory" in Albany.

<p>Except for the possible assessment of the house and lot of a "Peter Van Luven" in the vicinity of Schuyler Mansion on the assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, subsequent references to this Pieter Van Deusen have not yet been uncovered in the community-based record. A younger same-named individual was listed on the first ward census in <a href="../../census1800.html#5567">1800</a>. We move on for now seeking to answer <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on this subject's later life and passing.</p>
