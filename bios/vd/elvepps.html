<!-- Start Main Content -->
<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Elizabeth Van Epps</strong></a> was born about 1623. She was the daughter of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> Dirck and Maria Damens Van Epps.


<p>By 1660, she had become the wife of Albany newcomer - trader <a href="../b/gebancker6467.html">Gerrit Bancker</a>. She was the mother of several children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Banckers held property in several locations but were known as Albany <a href="../b/gebancker6467.html#prop">mainstays</a> for three decades. As Gerrit often was away from their Albany home, Lysbeth's activities were of higher profile than those of many early Albany women.







<p>Elizabeth Van Epps Bancker lost her husband in 1691. A year earlier, she had been named as principal heir in his <a href="../../wills/willgebancker.html">will</a>. Controlling substantial property in Albany, Schenectady, and New York, she re-located to Manhattan where she died on July 3, 1693 at the age of seventy. Her son, <a href="../b/ebancker6454.html">Evert Bancker</a>, inherited her substantial estate and became mayor of Albany in 1694. </p>
