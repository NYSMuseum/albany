<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Vanderpoel</b></a> was the daughter of <a href="tevdp6272.html">Teunis Cornelise</a> and Catrina Jans Croon Vanderpoel - early residents of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. She probably was born during the 1650s.</p>


<p>By 1680, she had married Albany merchant <a href="../vs/antvschaick3934.html">Anthony Van Schaick</a>. Eight of their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1682 and 1702. She was a member and baptism sponsor there and her husband was a church officer.</p>

<p>In 1694, she was named co-executor of her mother's estate which left her a share of a house in Holland. She raised her family in an <a href="../../census1697.html#102">Albany house</a> on State Street and also on the Van Schaick family farm on the upper Hudson. In 1712, she purchased a small piece of land for thirty shillings in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> with Johanna Van Stryden.</p>

<p>When Anthony Van Schaick filed a <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">will</a> in January 1737, it named Maria as sole beneficiary and co-executor of his considerable estate - although its did impose several conditions on her inheritance. Probably then in her eighties, Maria Vanderpoel Van Schaick died sometime after she also <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html#will">signed</a> that document.</p>
