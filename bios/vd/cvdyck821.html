<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Van Dyck</strong></a> was born in March 1642. He was the son of <i>Schout Fiscal</i> Hendrick and Dwertje Cornelis Van Dyck of New Amsterdam. His basic education came under <a href="../vi/ajvilp.html">Adrian Janse Van Ilpendam</a>. Then he was trained in <a href="../../trades/medical.html">medical practice</a>. By 1661, he had served a four year apprenticeship under <a href="../d/jadhinsse.html">Jacob D'Hinsse</a> - the surgeon at <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and husband of Van Dyck's sister.</p>

<p>By that time, he had settled in the upriver fur trading center. About 1663, he married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">on</a>e <a href="../l/ellakens.html">Elizabeth Lakens</a>. The marriage produced at least two sons before her death. In April 1682, he married the widow <a href="../b/elbeeck.html">Elizabeth  Beeck</a> Salisbury at the New York City Dutch Reformed church. That marriage 
        produced at least two daughters who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a member.</p>
      <p>Although only twenty-three-years-old, in 1665 Cornelis Van Dyck was accepting 
        his own apprentice <a href="../../trades/medical.html">surgeons</a>.

      <p>In September 1677, Van Dyck submitted an <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1bJXAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA164&lpg=PA164&dq=%22Elizabeth+Lakens%22+Van+Dyck&source=bl&ots=TjYuMrRFxo&sig=i2cluoCwqiOETkV0NjjcOvdVK08&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwirzLb6wKjQAhUC8IMKHQg-BA0Q6AEIMTAF#v=onepage&q=%22Elizabeth%20Lakens%22%20Van%20Dyck&f=false">affidavit</a> 
        in Albany authorizing two Amsterdam merchants (one named William Lakens) 
        to administer his present and future assets on behalf of Elizabeth Lakens 
        whom he identified as his wife, alive and well, and that he was her guardian. 
        However, five years later she was dead and he had remarried.
      <p>Dr. Van Dyck also was <a href="http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/files/7614/2777/4978/Court_Minutes_of_Albany_Rennselaerswyck_and_Schenectady_1675-1680_Vol_II.pdf.pdf">known</a> as a merchant and magistrate. He served for many 
        years as the physician for the almshouse. By <a href="../../census1679.html#821">1679</a>, 
        his house was an Albany landmark. He was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5etLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=%22van+dyck%22&source=bl&ots=4zaS8Er5YU&sig=U8zRO91IncYlKfqqvWbkKhV-xwY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipsabO89nMAhUGGD4KHXhVC0s4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22van%20dyck%22&f=false">active</a> on the Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real 
        estate</a> market and also acquired acreage <a href="../../na/sarapat.html">beyond</a> the Albany stockade.</p>
      <p>Cornelis Van Dyck died in 1686 and his widow remarried. His <a href="hvdyck830.html">son</a> 
        succeeded him in medical practice in Albany.</p>
