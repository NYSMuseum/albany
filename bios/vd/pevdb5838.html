<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Pieter Claese </strong></a> was born in April 1703. He was the son of Albany-area newcomers Cornelis C. and Susanna [Lievers or Ouderkirk] Vandenbergh. He was a middle child with several siblings and grew up on an Albany-area farm - probably in the vicinity of what became <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. With some historical precedent, we <a href="../../res/sp.html">refer</a> to this individual as "Petrus."

<p>In January 1731, he married New York resident Maria Lievers at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1748, five children had been christened in Albany where, over the next three decades, the parents were regular baptism sponsors and where Maria was a pewholder.

<p>In <a href="../../wills/willheoo.html">1738</a>, he witnessed the will of Hendrick Oothout of Rensselaerswyck. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5838">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> freeholders.

<p>In July 1746, he was named co-executor and heir of the <a href="../../wills/willedblood.html">estate</a> of his "cousin," Edward Blood. In June 1750, he was <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/collectionsforye28newyuoft/collectionsforye28newyuoft_djvu.txt">identified</a> as the husband of Marytie Lieverse and "of Albany" in the will filed by her Manhattan-based uncle.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, Petrus's property at Halfmoon was assessed substantially. 

<p>In August <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wd-LTleLtO8C&pg=PA428&lpg=PA428&dq=ARIANTJE+VAN+WOERDT&source=bl&ots=MdgO3HgF0Z&sig=XYhIRRH4fF7C9jEWjo0529oyfFE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=wBFFT4uiG8H30gGsyJyyBA&sqi=2&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=ARIANTJE%20VAN%20WOERDT&f=false">1773</a>, Petrus and his son Pieter were mentioned in the will filed by his sister.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5838">1790</a>, the household of "Petrus Vandenburgh" was configured on the census for Watervliet. At that time, five slaves were listed with him. 

<p>Calling himself "Petrus" of "the Boght," he filed a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> in August 1794. <a href="../../sources.html#en">It</a> named two sons as executors and three daughters (but no spouse) as his heirs. The will passed probate in June 1795.
  
<p>Pieter C. (Petrus) Vandenbergh <a href="../../res/guess.html">probably</a> had lived for more than ninety years.</p>
