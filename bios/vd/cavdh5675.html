<strong>Catharina Vanderheyden</strong></a> was born in Albany about 1664. She was the daughter of <a href="javdh5688.html">Jacob Tysse</a> and <a href="../h/anhals.html">Anna Hals</a> Vanderheyden. Her father was a tailor and trader and one of the early settlers of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>.

<p>"Caatje" grew up in Albany where her brother <a href="divdh5681.html">Dirck</a> was a prominent businessman and landholder who had taken over from their aged father. By the early     1680s, she had become the wife of the French trader <a href="../d/pdegarmo947.html">Pierre De Garmo</a>. She was the mother of his ten children born from the 1680s to 1704. She was a lifelong member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>As the Albany-based wife of a frequently absent French trader, Catharina was called on to answer complaints against her husband before the Albany court. She also was sued for slandering another Albany woman.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#947">1709</a>, she was identified as the co-owner of a piece of property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Perhaps she had inherited the parcel from the Vanderheydens.</p>

<p>No record has been found of her death.</p>
