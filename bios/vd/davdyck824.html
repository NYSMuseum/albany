<strong>David Van Dyck</strong></a> was born in November 1693. He was the son of Albany physician <a href="hvdyck830.html">Hendrick Van Dyck</a> and his wife <a href="../s/maschuyler1491.html">Maria Schuyler</a> Van Dyck. He grew up along the Albany waterfront but lost his father at age thirteen when Dr. Van Dyck drowned in the Hudson in 1707.


<p>By the time Widow Van Dyck had taken her family to live in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>, David had married <a href="../t/chtbroeck24.html">Christina Ten Broeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a></a>. By 1732, the marriage had produced eight children who were christened in Albany where both parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>These Van Dycks first <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#824">lived</a> in the second ward where David conducted business - which included purchasing wheat from the city government. He was a <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#824"> member</a> of an Albany troop of horse and was <a href="../../org/cc.html#1719">elected</a> alderman for the first ward in 1719 and 1720. At that time, he may have been living in the <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> house recently vacated by his mother or in a nearby home owned by <a href="../t/wtbroeck83.html">Wessel Ten Broeck</a>.  

<p>David Van Dyck was last noted in June 1723 when he was mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willwtbroeck.html">will</a> of his father-in-law. Perhaps, he too went home to Kinderhook!</p>
