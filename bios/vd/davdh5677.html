<strong>David Vanderheyden</strong></a> was born in May 1695. He was the son of <a href="divdh5681.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="../k/raketel4648.html">Rachel Ketelhuyn</a> Vanderheyden. He grew up in a trader's <a href="../../census1697.html#025">home</a> in Albany's first ward. By the time he was twenty, his parents had re-located to a farm in <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> where they lived for the next <a href="../../peace.html">two decades</a>.

<p>In December 1725, he married Albany native <a href="../v/geervisscher4125.html">Geertruy Visscher</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740 seven children had been christened at the Albany church where both parents were members, pewholders, and regular baptism sponsors.

<p>David Vanderheyden made his home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. He was numbered among the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1720fl">core group</a> of Albany-based <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchants</a>. In his younger days, he ventured into the Indian country to <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a>.  He found success in business over a long career by representing the interests of frontier developers including <a href="../l/jhlydius4615.html">John Henry Lydius</a> and <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>. A key in his success is the import/export <a href="../../books.html#armour">connections</a> he established with New York and beyond.

<p>Assessment rolls and other <a href="../../census1756.html#130">community documents</a> represented him as very wealthy and living in a "very good house."

<p>Like other successful Albany merchants, he invested in 
<a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyherkim/herkpatents.html">frontier land</a> while also purchasing <a href="../../res/realestate.html">parcels</a> within the boundaries of Albany. 

<p>He served the community when he was elected alderman in first <a href="../../org/cc.html#1745">1745</a>. He later served as assistant judge on the county court. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5677">1742</a> and again in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5677">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>A long career of service culminated in his commissioning as a Major and then Lieutenant Colonel in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> during the 1760s. He was known as "Major Vanderheyden."


<p>In February of 1770, he announced that he was "sick and weak," when David Vanderheyden filed a <a href="../../wills/willdavdh5677.html">will</a>. He died soon there after as the will passed probate in September.</p>
