<strong>Wilhelmus Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in January 1713. He was the third son born to the marriage of <a href="wyvdb5872.html">Wynant W.</a> and <a href="../vh/vovh6418.html">Volkie Van Hoesen</a> Vandenbergh. He grew up in the home of a <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> brickmaker.
 
<p>In May 1749, he was among the five children named in the <a href="../../wills/willwyvdb5872.html">will</a> of his father. His mother had died two years before.

<p>In November 1761, Wilhelmus would have been approaching fifty when he married the Widow Anna Vanderwerken (possibly born Vosburgh) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.  The marriage is said to have delivered widow Anna two additional children.

<p>Mostly known as "Wilhelmus" (and sometimes confused with an older <a href="wmvdb5861.html">uncle</a>), this mainline individual appears to have <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">lived</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> either with <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#vdb">or</a> near his brothers and sisters. Perhaps those properties had been described in the will of their father several decades earlier.

<p>During the 1760s and afterwards, he was paid on a number of occasions by the city government. In 1769, he delivered gravel with his horse and cart. In 1770, he transported  two Indians to Half Moon. In 1781, he was <a href="../../cddc.html">called</a> an "Albany city laborer" when he posted a bond for a Rensselaerswyck farmer. 

<p>In 1776, he was paid by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> for firewood and barracks repair. 

<p>In 1785, the State government paid his account for supplying "pasturage" for thirteen horses for twenty-three days.

<p> In 1790, this individual would have been in his late sixties and appears to have been considered the <a href="../../census1790.html#5864">head</a> of a Vandenbergh family group - although a "Wilhelmus Vandenburgh" also was the <a href="../../census1790.html#wmvdb">head</a> of a household in nearby Watervliet. In 1792, his houselot on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#montgomery">Montgomery</a> Street between Columbia and Steuben was shown on a city map.

<p>The Albany Wilhelmus Vandenbergh probably died sometime thereafter. By the end of the century, the Vandenbergh <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">property</a> in the third ward was off of the city rolls.</p>
