<strong>Dirck Vanderheyden</strong></a> was born about 1662. He was the son of Albany pioneers <a href="javdh5688.html">Jacob Tyssen</a> and <a href="../h/anhals.html">Anna Hals</a> Vanderheyden.</p>

<p>In March 1687, he married <a href="../k/raketel4648.html">Rachel Ketelhuyn</a> at the Albany Dutch church. By 1707, his eleven children had been christened at the Albany church where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>Dirck Vanderheyden was a frontier <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> who, in his earlier days, sometimes ventured far from Albany. By the 1690s, these Vanderheydens had set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where they were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#025">mainstays</a> for several decades. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5681">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. He served on juries, as assessor, firemaster, constable, and was <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">elected</a>  assistant alderman - first in 1704. His Albany property was <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">assessed</a> comparable to that of other businessmen. He was a contractor of the city and also served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>After 1700, he began to acquire land across the Hudson and to the north of Albany. By 1720, he had re-located to  a farm in <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> which he continued to improve for the rest of his life.


<p>Dirck Vanderheyden died in October 1738 and was buried from the Albany church.</p>
