<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Anna Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in March 1751. She was the daughter of Cornelis and Cornelia Vandenbergh. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on her background and early life.

<p>In May 1769, this daughter of the countryside was not yet eighteen when she married the somewhat older Albany native <a href="../c/obcooper498.html">Obadiah Cooper</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Between July 1770 and 1791, seven daughters had been christened at the Albany church where her husband was a member and where both parents served as baptism sponsors.

<p>These Coopers raised their family in a landmark <a href="../../census1790.html#498">home</a> on the corner of  <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">Pearl</a> and Hudson Streets. Obadiah supported his family as a merchant with a store on Market Street. 

<p>However, Anna Vandenbergh Cooper lived for only fifty years. She died in June 1801 and "Mrs. Hadiah Cooper" was buried in the Dutch church cemetery plot. Moving in with one of his married daughters, her husband lived until 1826.</p>
