<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Van Dyck</strong></a> was born in November 1689. He was the son of Albany physician <a href="hvdyck830.html">Hendrick Van Dyck</a> and his wife <a href="../s/maschuyler1491.html">Maria Schuyler</a> Van Dyck. Any medical training probably would have ended with the accidental drowning death of his father in 1707.

<p>In July 1721, he married Albany native <a href="../b/mabries6347.html">Maria Bries</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1731, six children had been christened at Albany.

<p>These Van Dycks lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Cornelis was identified as a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#822">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#822">1742</a>.
 
<p>Cornelis Van Dyck filed a <a href="../../wills/willcovdyck822.html">will</a> in March 1747. It left all of his estate to Maria and then to their son, <a href="hvdyck832.html">Henry</a>. Cornelis Van Dyck died in June 1747. He had lived fifty-eight years. His widow lived until 1756. Dr. Henry Van Dyck was the last of the Van Dyck <a href="../../trades/medical.html">physicians</a> in Albany.

        <a href="vandyck.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. This biography is conservatively constructed to avoid conflicts with the life of Dr. Cornelis Van Dyck of Schenectady who married Maria Mabie also in 1721. At this point, we cannot identify him as a physician - the calling of his father, son, and many of his kinsmen!</font> <br>
