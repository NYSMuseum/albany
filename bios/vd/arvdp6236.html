<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Ariaantie Vanderpoel</strong></a> was born in November 1695. She was the daughter of <a href="mewvdp.html">Melgert Vanderpoel</a> and his second wife, <a href="../t/elteller6602.html">Elizabeth Teller</a> Vanderpoel. She was raised in the hillside home of a large combined, mainline Albany family. 

<p>In September 1710, an <a href="../../wills/willmewvdp.html">action</a> of the Albany Mayor's Court protected her inheritance (a one-sixth share) from the estate of her deceased father even though the adolescent Ariaantie was not present at the proceeding.

<p>In February 1720, she was named among the heirs and promised "a legacy" from her mother's <a href="../../wills/willelizteller.html">estate</a>. 

<p>In December 1724, Ariaantie was twenty-nine when she married a somewhat older returned frontier trader named <a href="../vp/guvplanck1119.html">Guleyn Verplanck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1739, six children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Verplancks raised their family in the second ward where Gulyen was a prominent businessman and city official.

<p>Ariaantie lost her husband in July 1749. She lived on for a number of years - being identified as the "Widow Valplantin" on a <a href="../../census1756.html#133">list of householders</a> drawn by the British army in the summer of 1756. At that time, an occupation was given as "cooper & showmaker." But that reference may have described her sons who were becoming resident adults. Son Isaac had his mother living with him in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>.

<p>Ariaantie Vanderpoel Verplanck died sometime thereafter. </p>
