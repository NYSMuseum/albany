      <P><a href="#sources">Melgert Wynantse</a> was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New 
        Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="wygvdp6276.html">Wynant Gerritse</a> 
        and Tryntje Melgers Vanderpoel. Family sources state he was born in 1646. He grew up in what appears to have been a smallish family in the house of a mainline trader and regional landholder of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>/Albany.</p>
		
<p>In 1668, he married <a href="../vp/arvplanck1104.html">Ariaantie Verplanck</a> 
        with whom he had eight children. After her death, he married widow <a href="../t/elteller6602.html">Elizabeth 
        Teller</a> Van Tricht in 1692. That union added two more children to an 
        already large family. He was a member and supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> and an occassional baptism sponsor.</P>
      <p>His house on the hill faced the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> 
        and he also owned a lot on the South side of the city. In <a href="../../census1679.html#6268">1679</a>, 
        his home was included on the city assessment roll.</p>
      <p>He was called a "gunstockmaker." Like his father, he owned a sawmill, 
        bought and sold real estate, and also participated in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur 
        trade</a>. He was fined by the Albany court for having Indians in his 
        house. In 1686, he was appointed assistant alderman by the governor under 
        the new city <a href="../../charter.html">charter</a>. He later served 
        as a firemaster and juror.</p>
      <p>In 1695, he was the only family member named in the <a href="../../wills/willwygvdp.html">will</a> 
        filed by his father who then was living in New York. 
      <p>Although <a href="#mis">mis-identified</a>, his large, combined family 
        was included on the Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#142">census 
        of households</a> taken in June 1697. Two years later, he signed a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6268">loyalty 
        oath</a> to the king of England. <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6268">Later</a>, 
        he was identified as a home owner in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>.</p>
      <p>In September 1710, he was dead. An <a href="../../wills/willmewvdp.html">action</a> 
        of the Albany Mayor's Court regarding his estate noted his six living 
        children, real estate, two negroes, and a sawmill on the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</A>. 
        His widow was not mentioned in the proceeding but she lived for another 
        fifteen years.</p>

      <a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Melgert Wynantse <a href="vdp.html">Vanderpoel</a> 
      is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6268. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">profile</a> 
      is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
      resources</a>. A number of <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/vanderpoel.html">Online 
      resources</a> are interesting but conflicting. 
      <p><a name=mis></a><b>Mis-identification:</b> There was no individual named 
        "Melgert Wendell." Assuming a rough location order for the census, his 
        State Street home would have been in that proximity - near other Wendell 
        houses. And the seven children fits well with the combining of two households 
        following his re-marriage in 1692.</p>
