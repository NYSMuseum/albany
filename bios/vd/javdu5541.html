<strong>Jacob Van Deusen</strong></a> was born in September 1748. That would make him a younger son of regional residents Abraham and Rachel Pels Van Deusen.

<p>In May 1771, he married <a href="../l/elslansing3229.html">Elsie Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1791, eight children had been christened in Albany - their names reflecting those of the grandparents.

<p>In his mid-twenties at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775</a>, we seek to account for this Jacob's wartime activities. As another same-named individual was alive in Albany County, at this point we can say that he contributed to the revolutionary cause in 1775 and that, afterwards, Jacob was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5541">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment.

<p>This Van Deusen family eventually settled in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Jacob was chosen firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1773">1773</a>. Assessment rolls show two parcels of city property in the second ward in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5541">1779</a>. But, beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5541">1788</a>, his house and lot were located in the third ward and assessed moderately. In <a href="../../census1790.html#5541">1790</a>, his home had nine residents members. A <a href="../../census1800.html#5541">decade later</a>, a younger "Jacob Van Deuzen" was identified as the head of a first ward household.

<p>We seek information on the passing of this Jacob Van Deusen.
