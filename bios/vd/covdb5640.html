<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelia Vandenbergh</strong></a> was the wife of English-identified <a href="../../newcomers.html">n</a>ewcomer resident <a href="../g/jogilbert5155.html">John Gilbert</a>.

<p>She is said to have been the daughter of <a href="arvdb.html">Arent</a> and Maria Vandenbergh who are said to have come to New Netherland in 1654. Perhaps she then would have been born during the 1660s when her father owned a house in Albany. 

<p>By 1683, she had become a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By the next year, church records identified her as Cornelia "Gilbornz." Beginning in 1685, three children were christened at the church in Albany. A boy was named "Arent" - perhaps to honor her father. <a href="../../sources.html#cma">Co</a>urt minutes referred to Arent's father-in-law in 1681.

<p>These Gilberts <a href="../../census1697.html#126">raised</a> their family in Albany where Jan was known as a <a href="../../garrison.html">soldier</a> and a baker.

<p>John Gilbert died in 1707. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">1709</a>, her name <a href="#app">appeared</a> on the assessment roll for the second ward.

<p>In 1714, church records <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22cornelia+gilbert%22+albany&source=bl&ots=jv8NVzm4eT&sig=GWrjnlXkTk7zTxEA8SqAdU3PUFw&hl=en&ei=O3ATTKujJIH6lwf064igDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q&f=false">noted</a> that Cornelia Gilbert was paid six pounds for the release of her claim on the pastures.
<p>In November 1717, provincial records <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ggQKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA961&lpg=PA961&dq=%22cornelia+gilbert%22+albany&source=bl&ots=gKHvxfop4p&sig=w83AqxBT0TXAj5FyqhnCpPYKb18&hl=en&ei=724TTLaqJYTGlQfOj_2kDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CCoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22cornelia%20gilbert%22%20albany&f=false">ordered</a> that "Cornelia Gilbert," the widow of John (deceased), would be paid for bread he supplied to the soldiers in Albany in 1682.

<p>We seek informaton on the later life and passing of Cornelia Vandenbergh Gilbert. By the 1720s, her three daughters had been married at the Albany church. </p>
