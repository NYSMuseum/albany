<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Catharina Van Deusen</strong></a> was born about 1748. She probably was the daughter of Cornelis and Lea Ostrander Van Deusen.
 
<p>In April 1771, her marriage to <a href="../g/wmgroesbeck3387.html">William Groesbeck</a> was proclaimed from the pulpit of <a hre="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. By 1784, the marriage had produced six  children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>These Groesbecks lived on the North side of Albany in a number of residences along the course of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. Perhaps Groesbeck earned a living as clerk of the Dutch church. In 1797, their church-owned house on Dock Street was destroyed during <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> that ravaged that area of the city.  
 
<p>Catharina Van Deusen Groesbeck lost her husband in 1802. He had lived less than fifty years. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, the Albany assessment roll identified her as a widow and stated that she owned a house and lot on Orange Street and a lot on Steuben Street. Subsequently, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> called her a widow living in a house at 78 <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a> in 1816. She died in November 1821 at the age of seventy-three.
