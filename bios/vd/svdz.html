<P>Family tradition holds that <A href="#sources"><B>Storm Vanderzee</B></A> was born on the <a href="http://olivetreegenealogy.com/ships/nnship28.shtml">ship</a> that carried his family to America in 1636-37. He was the second son of Norwegian ancestry New Netherland pioneers Albert Andriese and Anna Van Rotmers <a href="../../bios/b/bradt.html">Bradt</a>. </P>


<p>Growing up on the Normanskill, by the mid-1650s he was trading lumber, furs, and tobacco in New Amsterdam - probably on his father's behalf. In 1662, he obtained a lot and then a house in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. Thereafter, he settled in Albany - forming a number of trading partnerships, opening a tavern, and marrying <a href="../../bios/l/hilansing3400.html">Hilletie Lansing</a>. The marriage produced several children. By that time, he had adopted the surname "Vanderzee" - the name used by his descendants.</P>

<p>Running a tavern and other enterprises frequently <a href="#court">brought him before</a> the Albany magistrates. In February 1679, Storm and Hilletie filed a joint will. It stated that he was sick but she was well. He was listed on a <a href="../../census1679.html#4184">census of householders</a> made a month later. In May, another legal document stated that Storm Vanderzee had died at age forty-two. His two sons carried on the family name in the city of Albany.</p>
