<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gysbert Cornelisse</strong></a> was born during the first three decades of the seventeenth century. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=0gMzAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA837&lpg=PA837&dq=gijsbert+cornelisz&source=bl&ots=GyUOyJIYnn&sig=bu1jSVdaiZzFd6scrETKQO9FdYg&hl=en&ei=wO8uTteGKqXw0gGmgIHlAQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=gijsbert%20cornelisz&f=false">said</a> to have been from Breucklen (in Utrecht) and to have been a Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">tenant</a> beginning in 1648. "Gijsbert Cornelisz van den Hoogenberch" may have been the first <a href="vdb.html">Vandenbergh</a> family member in Albany. However, his life seems to have been distinct from a similarly named <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qo808tARY-EC&pg=PA474&lpg=PA474&dq=%22gysbert+cornelisz+de+weert%22&source=bl&ots=h98jQHAmGw&sig=vwTCnVkXQMQPzusQmNjQgJ8WGfM&hl=en&ei=sH0xTp8IifXSAajPtOEL&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22gysbert%20cornelisz%20de%20weert%22&f=false">contemporary</a>.

<p>His wife was Elizabeth and their children were born during the 1640s and 50s. At least two sons and a daughter married and became Albany residents.

<p>In February 1651, an "inventory of Animals found on the farm of gijsbert Cornelissen van breuckelen on the hill," was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA735&lpg=PA735&dq=gijsbert+cornelisz&sig=bu1jSVdaiZzFd6scrETKQO9FdYg&ei=wO8uTteGKqXw0gGmgIHlAQ&ct=result&id=0gMzAQAAIAAJ&ots=GyUOyJIYnn#v=onepage&q=gijsbert%20cornelisz&f=false">printed</a> in the <a href="../../sources.html#vrbm"><i>VRBM</i></a>.

<p>He appears to have appeared frequently before the Rensselaerswyck court during the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Tg0MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA221&lpg=PA221&dq=%22cornelissen+gysbert%22&source=bl&ots=QFnR_esTPH&sig=jlj1ZsDjWpYTmjERhk1VxdQ_6xQ&hl=en&ei=ZHsxTojYD4Lq0gGt6pmeDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22cornelissen+gysbert%22&f=false">1650s</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#gycvdb">1674</a>, he was among those invited to the funeral of the director of Rensselaerswyck. Gysbert and his two sons were identified on that list as "Van der Bergh." His name appears in the manor records into 1675.

<p>In 1662, he is said to have purchased a farm near <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> from Martin Cornelise Van Buren. He appears to have held a number of properties in the hinterland (Rensselaerswyck) surrounding Beverwyck/Albany. However, his name is absent from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based</a> resources so far encountered.

<p>In 1678, Gysbert Cornelis is said to have occupied a farm in Greenbush. Perhaps, he was the Gysbert Cornelis whose household was configured on the Rensselaerswyck census in <a href="../../census1697.html#gyvdb">1697</a>.

<p>Although <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> technically a city resident, Gysbert Cornelisse Vandenbergh was the father of what became the Albany Vandenbergh family. We seek more definitive information on his life and especially on his passing. </p>
