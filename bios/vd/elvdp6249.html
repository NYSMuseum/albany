<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Vanderpoel</b></a> was born during the mid-1650s. She was the daughter of <a href="tevdp6272.html">Teunise Cornelise</a> and Catharina Croon Vanderpoel.


<p>About 1675, she married <a href="../vs/syvschaick3982.html">Sybrant Van Schaick</a>. He died a decade into the marriage. In June 1686, the widow married a slightly younger <a href="../vc/bevc5336.html">Benomi Van Curler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1700, nine of her children from the two marriages had been christened in Albany where she was a long-time member and frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>Elizabeth raised her family in a comfortable Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#040">home</a>. In 1683, she was named sole heir of Sybrant Van Schaick. Following the death of her second husband in 1704, she carried on as the <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">head</a> of her <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household for several decades. Several of her children became prominent Albany residents.</p>
 

<p>"Aged and weak," widow Elizabeth Vanderpoel Van Schaick Van Curler filed a <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a> in November 1750. By that time, her daughter, Maria, was caring for her mother. Elizabeth died in January 1754 and was buried from the Albany church.
