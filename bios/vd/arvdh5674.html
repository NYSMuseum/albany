<p> <a href="#biography"><b>Ariantie Vanderheyden</b></a> was born about 1674 the daughter of Albany tailor/fur trader Jacob Tysse and Anna Hals Vanderheyden. She grew up in her father's Market Street home and subsequently joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Reformed Church</a>.</p>

          <p>In October 1695, her daughter <a href="revdh5714.html">Rebecca</a> was baptized in the Albany church. No 
            father's name appeared on the baptism record. However, two months 
            later, Ariantie's sister, Cornelia, appeared before the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a> 
            petitioning for support of the child from Lieutenant <a href="../y/syoung6901.html">Simeon 
            Young</a> - who Ariantie claimed was the father. Months later, Young 
            acknowledged his paternity and stated that the child would "never 
            want [for] bread" if it was sent to live with him. To that, Ariantie 
            <a href="#replied">replied</a> "she will never give her child to Simon 
            Young."</p>

<p>No further record of Ariantie Vanderheyden has been found!</p>
