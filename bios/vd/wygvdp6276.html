<P> <a href="#sources"></a><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional <a href="http://www.currays.net/Curtis%20Web%20Project/ps03/ps03_133.htm">sources</a> tell us that <a href="#sources"><b>Wynant Gerritse Vanderpoel</b></a> was born in Europe about 1620. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Thus</a>, he would have been the son of Gerrit Vanderpoel and Cornelia Wynants. He married Tryntie Melchoir about 1640. The marriage produced at least two sons and two daughters before Tryntje's death about 1671.</p>

<p> By the 1650s, these Vanderpoels were living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> in a house on the south side of what became <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. In 1660, his name was included on a <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6276">petition</a> regarding the fur trade. During these decades, he was <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#6276">counted</a> among the substantial members of the community. </p>

<p>In 1674, he purchased half interest in a sawmill east of the Hudson on a stream that later would be called the "Wynantskill." But during that time, he was a mainline Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#136">resident</a>, involved in <a href="#involved">business</a>, and a frequent litigant. He also was a <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html">member</a> of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>During the early 1690s, he appears to have removed his family to New York City.

<p>Wynant Gerritse Vanderpoel filed a <a href="../../wills/willwygvdp.html">will</a> in February 1695. It stated that he was a former resident of Albany but then was living in New York. It named a <a href="mewvdp.html">son</a> and son-in-law but not a wife. He is said to have died in 1699. His will passed probate in New York in April 1702.</p>
