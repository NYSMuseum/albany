<strong>Wynant W. Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born about 1675. He was the eldest son of the marriage of Albany residents <a href="wgvdb5641.html">Willem G.</a> and <a href="cavdp.html">Catharina Vanderpoel</a> Vandenbergh. He grew up in <a href="../../census1697.html#070">mainline</a> home of a cartman who lived in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a>.

<p>He married <a href="../vh/vovh6418.html">Volkie Van Hoesen</a> of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in December 1700. By 1723, eight children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>This Vandenbergh family lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where his property was accorded a modest <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5872">assessment</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5872">1699</a>, he joined his neighbors in pledging allegiance to the king of England. He was a sergeant in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>, served as juror and firemaster, was listed among third ward <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5872">freeholders</a>, and performed contract services for the Albany government. This long-lived Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#286">mainstay</a> was a brickmaker. For a time, he held a lot on the <a href="../../loc/wout.html">flats</a> near the northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">border</a> of Albany.

<p>Wynant W. Vandenbergh lost his wife in April 1747. He filed a <a href="../../wills/willwyvdb5872.html">will</a> in May 1749 dividing his estate among five living children. He died in September 1758 and was buried in the church cemetery.
