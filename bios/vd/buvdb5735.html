<strong>Burger Vandenbergh</strong></a> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on August 3, 1740. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents <a href="vovdb2441.html">Volkert</a> and Catharina Huyck Vandenbergh. He grew up a middle child in a large family. His christian name was a standard in the <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/huyck.html">H</a>uyck family.

<p>This individual does not seem to have married or to have raised a family. 

<p>In September 1766, he was among the heirs listed in the <a href="../../wills/willvovdb2441.html">will</a> filed by his father. He was named co-executor, heir to his father's dwelling house and lot in Rensselaerswyck, to his lots on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> in Albany, and also to inherit his father's Albany <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">brick</a>yard. Volkert's will passed probate the following July - leaving Burger with substantial holdings and to provide housing for his older, widowed sister as well.

<p>In May 1767, his name appeared on the roster of Ryckert Van Vranken's company of the Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. During the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war years</a>, his name was on the roster of the third regiment of the Albany County militia under Philip P. Schuyler . We seek  more complete information on his wartime activities.

<p>In April 1778, he sold a lot on the north side of Foxes Creek to Daniel Winne, Jr. In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5735">1779</a>, his lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> was valued more substantially than those located nearby.

<p>During the 1780s, Burger Vandenbergh witnessed baptisms at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>.

<p>By 1790, the name of Burger Vandenbergh had dropped from Albany-area rolls.
