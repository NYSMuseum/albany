<strong>Abraham Tewisse</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the son of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> trader then Claverack residents <a href="mavdu5561.html">Mattheus Abrahamse</a> and Helena Robberts Van Deusen. In June 1686, he was named in his father's will as his fifteen-year-old twin son.

<p>Abraham began his adult life holding down his father's Albany house. According to a census of householders, he was alone in that building in <a href="../../census1697.html#150">1697</a>. In May of that year, he married <a href="../vs/jacvschoon5900.html">Jacomyntie Van Schoonhoven</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1707, the marriage had produced five children who were christened in Kingston and Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3892">1699</a>, he joined his Albany neighbors in pledging allegiance to the king of England. A year earlier he had been identified as a shoemaker and a freeman of New York City.

<p>The name of Abraham Tewisse Van Deusen was absent from Albany rolls following the baptism of his son in June 1707. He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have moved between Albany and Kingston and to have died in Kingston in 1746!</p>
