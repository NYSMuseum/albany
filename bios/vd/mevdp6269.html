<P><a href="#sources"><b>Melgert Vanderpoel</b></a> was born during the early 1670s. He was the son of Albany mainstay <a href="mewvdp.html">Melgert Wynantse</a> and his first wife, Ariaantie Verplanck. He was known as "Melgert Melgertse" and "Melgert Vanderpoel, Jr."</p>


<p>In May 1696, he married <a href="../va/cavallen5606.html">Catharina Van Allen</a> of Kinderhook. By 1716, the marriage had produced nine children.</p>

<p>These Vanderpoels set up their Albany home near that of his father on the hill near the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a>. Melgert Melgertse followed his father in community service as a juror, firemaster, and contractor of the city. In 1715, he was a member of an Albany militia <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">troop</a>. In 1697, his new household was configured on the <a href="../../census1697.html#144">city census</a>. In 1699, he pledged <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6269">loyalty</a> to the King of England. Over the next decade, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> property was valued on city <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6269">assessment rolls</a>.</p>

<p>In 1712, Melgert Melgertse was deeded 120 acres of land on the east side of the Hudson, twelve miles south of Albany by his father-in-law. These Vanderpoels then relocated to the Kinderhook area where he became a <a href="http://www.genealogy-quest.com/collections/nyalby.html">freeholder</a> and died about  1720.</p>
