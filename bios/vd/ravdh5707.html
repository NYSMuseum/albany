<strong>Rachel Vanderheyden</strong></a> was born in September 1703. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="divdh5681.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="../k/raketel4648.html">Rachel Ketelhuyn</a> Vanderheyden. She grew up in a trader's home in the first ward and moved with her family to <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> by 1720.


<p>In January 1724, she married her cousin, Manhattan native <a href="jovdh5697.html">Johannes Vanderheyden</a>, at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1748, the marriage had produced eight children who were christened at the Albany church where both parents were baptism sponsors. According to family-based <a href="">resources</a>, her husband had lived with Rachel's Albany family since the death of his father in 1702.

<p>These Vanderheydens lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Johannes practiced law and was a mainline community member.


<p>Rachel Vanderheyden died and was buried from the Dutch church on on February 22, 1754. Her husband may have re-married. No wife was named in the <a href="../../wills/willjovdh5697.html">will</a> that he filed in 1771.</p>
