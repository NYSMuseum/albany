      <P>Based on subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#pevdu">res</a>ources, 
        <a href="../../res/sp.html">th</a>is <a href="#sources"> <strong>Peter 
        Van Deusen</strong></a> was born after 1756. He <a  href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lY1YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=%22pieter+van+deursen&source=bl&ots=uR_NrDRXyK&sig=w2na4DdWALCWw4uxCeD09EkN2o8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CmWkUvDcCbjIsASsnYHACg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22pieter%20van%20deursen&f=false">appears</a> 
        to have been the son of William and Cornelia Gilbert Van Deursen of New 
        York City and was christened there in July 1762. We seek information on 
        his early life and <a href="../../res/origins.html">path</a> to Albany. 
        We are mindful here of a similarly named slightly older <a href="pivdu5567.html">contemporary</a> 
        Albany resident and of more regional namesakes as well. 
      <p>Peter "Van Dausen" (one of two PVDs on list) received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#pevdu">bounty 
        right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. Otherwise, 
        we seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activies.
		
<p>In July 1786, he is said to have married <a href="../b/lybrewster.html">Lydia Brewster</a> of Middletown Connecticut. Their first child was born in New York in 1787. Between 1793 and 1805, at least five of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>At least by 1790, Peter and Lydia were raising their family in Albany's 
        <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. The <a href="../../census1790.html#pevdu">first 
        Federal census</a> showed that his household included five people. In 
        August 1790, his property/residence was <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">located</a> 
        on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> 
        between Steuben and Columbia Streets. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#pevdu">later</a>, 
        the middle-aged couple and five children were living under his roof. The 
        assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, 
        valued his house and lot in the third ward and his holdings modestly. 
      <p>Family-based resources have identified him as an attorney. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> 
        documentation of that connection. If so, perhaps he was associated with 
        his Market Street neighbors - the <a href="../vv/vvechten.html">Van Vechtens</a>. 
      <p>Peter Van Deusen died in Albany in April 1809. He had lived less than 
        forty-seven years. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22van+deusen%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22van%20deusen%22&f=false">1813</a>, 
        his widow was identifed as a resident of 60 Fox Street - an address that 
        had a number of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22van+deusen%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=60%20fox&f=false">seemingly 
        unrelated</a> people living there. 
      <p>"Lydia Van Deuerson relict of the late Peter" was buried from the church 
        in April 1832. She had lived for seventy years. <br>
