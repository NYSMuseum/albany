      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Arent Van Deusen</strong></a> was born in 
        April 1719. He was the son of Albany-area residents Mattheus and Engeltie 
        Slingerland Van Deusen. His small family included only an older <a href="jovdu5546.html">brother</a>. 
      <p>A day after his brother's wedding in April 1745, Arent was identified 
        as a <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">mason</a> when he married 
        <a href="../w/cawaldron675.html">Catharina Waldron</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. By 1751, the marriage had produced three daughters who were 
        christened in the church where both parents were lifelong members. His 
        wife died in 1760 and he does not seem to have re-married. 
      <p>Arent <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> "Aaron" followed his father-in-law 
        into masonry work - probably continuing in that field with the Waldrons 
        for much of his working life. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5503">1763</a>, 
        his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders. During the 1760s, 
        his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings were valued on 
        city assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> and 
        he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. During the mid-decades of the eighteenth century, his name was 
        found on Albany accounts and in the records of the city government where 
        he was paid for services. However, he does not seem to have held any public 
        service positions. 
      <p>Well into his fifties at the outbreak of hostilities in <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">1775,</a> 
        he would have been too old for active service. Most likely, his same-named 
        godson was the other A. Van Deusen accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5503">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#5503">1779</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5503">1788</a>, 
        his second ward holdings were valued on the Albany assessment rolls. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5503">1790</a>, his household also 
        included a boy and four females. 
      <p>In <a href="../../wills/willbaroseboom1590.html">1782</a>, outstanding 
        debts to former Albany resident <a href="../r/baroseboom1590.html">Barent 
        Roseboom</a> were forgiven. 
      <p>Arent Van Deusen died in March 1792 and was buried from his church. </p>
