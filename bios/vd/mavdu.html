<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Van Deusen</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">sometimes</a> Van Deursen) was born in February 1747. Her parents were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lY1YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA71&lpg=PA71&dq=%22william+van+deursen%22+gilbert&source=bl&ots=uRZOqEOXtL&sig=rzFuoMNfZPNkLtfPu_Ymsb0Wx0I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=UKUZUo7JNZC49gS8yYCwCw&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22william%20van%20deursen%22%20gilbert&f=false">William</a> and Catherine Gilbert Van Deusen of New York. She was an older daughter in the very large family of a Manhattan cordwainer or tallow chandler. 

<p>In April 1764, she married Albany native <a href="../s/dischuyler1270.html">Dirck Schuyler, Jr.</a> in New York City. Between 1768 and 1775, four children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where they were regular baptism sponsors from 1792 to perhaps 1798.

<p>Schuyler was an officer in the Revolutionary army. Perhaps, they lived under the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#Wvdu">umbrella</a> of what may have been a <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">refugee</a> Van Deusen family in Albany during the war years.

<p>Maria Van Deusen Schuyler was deceased according to the <a href="http://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnew38newy#page/164/mode/2up">will</a>  filed by her father in March 1787. However, her unnamed children were specified to share in his estate.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#1270">1800</a>, these Schuylers made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 

<p>Dirck Schuyler died at the end of 1806.

<p>Seeking defining information on the Albany life and passing of Maria Van Deusen Schuyler, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
