<P><a href="#sources"><b>Claes Ripse</b></a> was a carpenter, contractor, and trader in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and then Albany. He was the father of Council member and acting provincial governor <a href="rvd6353.html">Rip Van Dam</a>.</p>

<p>In 1653, his name began to appear on the dockets of the Beverwyck/Albany courts. In that year, he was sued for defaulting on the rent for a house on Manhattan. After that, he was a frequent litigant in Albany where much of his involvment related to carpentry work. He also appeared before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> as an attorney, juror, and arbitrator.</p>

<p>He was married to Maria Bords. The marriage produced several children who lived to adulthood. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and active in its operations.

<p>By 1676, he had established a permanent residence on what became <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Chapel Street</a>. He also owned a lot on Pearl Street. His name appeared on the Albany census of <a href="../../census1679.html#33">1679</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1681.html">1681</a>, he was identified as a "burgher."</p>     


<p>He was elected alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> beginning in 1689. In 1693, he was identified as a justice of the peace for <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#115">1697</a>, he and Maria were living alone in their second ward home. He signed the <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6352">loyalty oath</a> of  1699. During the next decade, his second ward property was assessed at the highest rate. Claes Ripse died after <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6352">1709</a> and the Van Dam name passed from Albany rolls!</p>
