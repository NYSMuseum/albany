<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Willem Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in September 1701. He was the first son born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="covdb5644.html">Cornelis Willemse</a> and <a href="../w/mawinne3008.html">Maria Winne</a> Vandenbergh. He grew up in a cartman's home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.
 
<p>He was identified as the eldest son in a <a href="../../wills/willcowvdb.html">will</a> written by his father in 1707. He was left a gun, pistols, and holsters to satisfy the "eldest son" requirement of English inheritance law. In 1714, he also was named among the heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willwgvdb5641.html">will</a> filed by his grandfather.

<p>After that, the name of this Willem Vandenbergh appears to be absent from Albany rolls. He was not named in the <a href="../../wills/willmawinne3008.html">will</a> filed by his mother in 1745 - a document in which his younger brother, <a href="advdb5719.html">Adam</a>, was called her eldest son.
