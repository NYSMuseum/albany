<strong>Catharina Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born  in August 1726. She was the daughter of <a href="wyvdb5872.html">Wynant</a> and <a href="../vh/vovh6418.html">Volkie Van Hoesen</a> Vandenbergh. She was a younger daughter among the eight children born into the family  of a <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> brickmaker. 

<p>In July of 1744, she was not yet eighteen when Catharina married her <a href="http://vanhoesen.blogspot.com/">co</a>usin <a href="../vh/hevh772.html">Hendrick Van Hoesen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, he was deceased by the time their second <a href="../vh/hevh5737.html">child</a> was presented for baptism in November 1748. In May 1749, she was but twenty-two when she was identified as the widow of Hendrick in the <a href="../../wills/willwyvdb5872.html">will</a> filed by her father. Along with her siblings, she was named to share in his estate.

<p>Catharina did not re-marry. Beginning in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">mid-1760s</a>, she was identified with her unmarried <a href="vovdb5857.html">sister</a> as the owners of <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1707">property</a> in the third ward. In <a href="../../census1790.html#vdbsis">1790</a>, "Cathelina Van Husen" was named as the head of a third ward household consisting of three women and three slaves.

<p>Catharina Vandenbergh Van Hoesen and her sister had dropped from Albany <a href="../../census1800.html">rolls</a> by the end of the decade.</p>
