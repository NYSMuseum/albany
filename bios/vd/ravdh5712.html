<P><a href="#sources"><b>Rachel Vanderheyden</b></a> was the wife of early Albany's foremost physician. Rachel was born in July 1740. She was the youngest child of Albany mainstays <a href="davdh5677.html">David</a> and <a href="../v/geervisscher4125.html">Geertruy Visscher</a> Vanderheyden. Her father was a prominent Albany businessman and civic leader.</p>


<p>She had just passed her eighteenth birthday in November 1758 when she married newcomer <a href="../s/sastringer5046.html">Dr. Samuel Stringer</a>. Although her husband was an Anglican, she was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their marriage produced only one son and two daughters.</p>

<p>As a physician's wife, she came into daily contact with a large number of people who visited her home and Dr. Stringer's office in the third ward. By the 1780s, she was living in a large  <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">double house</a> on Market Street which the Stringers shared with their daughter, the wife of attorney and New York State officier <a href="../l/stlush416.html">Stephen Lush</a>.</p>

<p>Rachel Vanderheyden Stringer died in 1797 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
