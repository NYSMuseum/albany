<strong>Walter Vanderzee </strong></a> (many <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iations)  was born in February 1753. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerwcyck resident Anthony Vanderzee and (possibly) his third wife, Anna Van Ness Vanderzee. He grew up a younger son in a large combined family that lived on a farm located south of Albany. 

<p>In May 1776, he married Maria Peek of Rensselaerswyck at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1790, three of their children had been christened in Albany. The marriage produced more children who probably were baptized elsewhere.

<p>In his twenties during the Revolution, we seek information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. However, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5601">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>The couple set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. By <a href="../../census1790.html#5601">1790</a>, his household included eight members including five boys under sixteen.

<p>Walter Vanderzee probably had passed or had moved on by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> when his name was not on the Albany assessment roll.
