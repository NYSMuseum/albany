<p>The <a href="#sources"> <strong>Van Deusen family</strong></a> of early Albany descends from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Pietersen_van_Deusen">Abraham         Pieterse</a> and Tryntje Melchiors who, following their marriage in Haarlem in 1629, emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. Perhaps their six surviving children had been born in Europe as well.

<p>They settled in New Amsterdam where Abraham Pieters attained wealth and status prior to the English takeover in 1664. He died a few years later.

<p>The first son, <a href="mavdu5561.html">Mattheus Abrahams</a>, settled 
        in Beverwyck during the 1650s. By the time of his death, the <a href="../../familynames.html#v">family</a> 
        was known regionally as "Van Deusen." 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, the Albany census listed 
        <a href="meavd5564.html">Melgert</a> and <a href="abvdu3892.html">Tewisse 
        Abrahams</a> - and their kinsmen <a href="havdu5529.html">Harpert Jacobse</a> 
        and <a href="wmvdu5574.html">Willem Jacobse</a> Van Deusen, as Albany 
        householders. 
      <p>From that time on, the family maintained a small but consistent presence 
        in Albany. However, during the eighteenth century, the Van Deusens spread 
        across old <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> and beyond. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, only the household of carpenter <a href="jovdu5546.html">John Van Dusen</a> was <a href="../../census1756.html#178">described</a> on the census of householders in the city taken by the British army.

<p>Manhattan native <a href="mavdu.html">Maria Van Deusen</a> was the wife of Albany patriot officer Dirck Schuyler, Jr. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">1779</a>, six separate Van Deusen properties were valued on the Albany assessment roll. After the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, five Van Deusens were included on the <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty list</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment. <a href="../../res/guess.html">M</a>aybe a number of Van Deusens from downriver had taken <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#wvdu">refuge</a> in Albany during the war years.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, six Van Deusen households 
        were named on the census for the city of Albany. 
      <p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA92,M1">1813</a>, 
        four Van Deusen addresses appeared in the first city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a>. 
        They were a carpenter, physician, and two widows. 
      <p>The Van Deusen name celebrates two distinguished American historians <a href="http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2000/0005/0005mem3.cfm">Albert</a> and <a href="http://www.library.rochester.edu/index.cfm?page=1177">Glyndon G.</a> Van Deusen) who lived during the twentieth century.</p>
