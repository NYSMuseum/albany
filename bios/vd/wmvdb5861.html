      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Wilhelmus Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born 
        in June 1692. He was the son of <a href="wgvdb5641.html">Willem Gysbertse</a> 
        and <a href="cavdp.html">Catharina Vanderpoel</a> Vandenbergh. He was 
        a middle child in the family of a cartman who lived in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North 
        End</a> of Albany. He was <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as "Wilhelmus" 
        as other "William Vandenberghs" were living in Albany County at that time. 
      <p>In 1714, he was identified as one of four living sons and named as an 
        heir in the <a href="../../wills/willwgvdb5641.html">will</a> of his father. 
        The next year, he was listed on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. 
      <p>In October 1716, he married <a href="geervdb5780.html">Geertie Vandenbergh</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1731, seven 
        children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=%22nicolaes+groesbeeck%22+clay&source=bl&ots=GuM8-o4GJJ&sig=8plxzJBvqMHCR2u9wJwRksXtgIE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1MqfUKehJu3k2wXaooDgDw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">1728</a>, he and a <a href="../g/nigroesbeck3370.html">partner</a> were granted a six year lease to dig clay in the city of Albany.

<p>Perhaps following the death of his father by 1728, these Vandenberghs lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Wilhelmus was named firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1731">1731</a> and 
        a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5861">1742</a> and 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5861">1763</a>. He was known as 
        a 
      <a href="../../census1756.html#28">mason</a> and was compensated by the 
      city government for services provided. 
      <p>In September 1743, The city government was improving Albany's fortifications 
        and sought to acquire some of his Albany land. Wilhelmus declined and 
        the council ordered the land to be appraised as Vandenbergh refused to 
        sell it at a reasonable price. The results are not known. 

<p>In 1748, his house and lot in the third ward was described in the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> of Dirck Ten Broeck. In May 1749, he was named co-executor of his brother's estate.

<p>Wilhelmus Vandenbergh lived into the 1760s when his modest third ward holdings were valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. After that, his name dropped from community-based resources.
