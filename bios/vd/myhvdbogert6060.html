<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Myndert Harmense Vandenbogert</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Vandenbogert) was born in May 1643. He was the son of legendary <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="#hmvdb">Harmen Myndertse Vandenbogert</a>. His <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=jenn222&id=I126327">mother</a> is said to have been <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Gillisje Claesz" (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Switts/Shou). This son of New Netherland has been known by a number of variably <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled names.

<p>By the mid 1680s, he had married the somewhat younger <a href="../s/helscher.html">Helena Schermerhorn</a>. By 1692, the marriage produced at least six children. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and a regular baptism sponsor. In <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#6060">1683</a>, he made a substantial pledge in a community-based initiative to support a <a href="../d/godellius.html">second minister</a> in Albany. 

<p>In May 1688, he was noted in the <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">will</a> filed by his father-in-law.

<p>For more than a decade Myndert Harmense was an Albany mainstay. In <a href="../../census1679.html#6060">1679</a>, he was counted among the Albany householders and his holdings were assessed substantially. In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5etLAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA287&lpg=PA287&dq=%22myndt+harmense.%22&source=bl&ots=4zaS8Er5YU&sig=U8zRO91IncYlKfqqvWbkKhV-xwY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipsabO89nMAhUGGD4KHXhVC0s4ChDoAQgbMAA#v=onepage&q=%22myndt%20harmense.%22&f=false">1685</a>, he purchased a piece of pastureland north of the <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Vosenkill</a> from Dr. <a href="cvdyck821.html">Cornelis Van Dyck</a>.  In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#6060">1689</a>, his property in the first ward was valued on an assessment for defense of the city.

<p>During the 1680s, he was known in Albany and beyond as a "<a href="../../trades/wood.html">gunstock</a> maker" and as a <a href="../../econ/comec.html">trader</a>. In August 1687, he was listed among the Albany assessors. In June 1692, he was identified as a juror serving before the Albany <a href="../../org/mayorct.html">Mayor's Court</a>. At that time, his residence is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been located on the south side of State Street, above Pearl.

<p>In 16<a href="http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/review/pdfs/hvrr_3pt2_mcdermott.pdf">84</a>-1686, he was a <a href="https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028853327/cu31924028853327_djvu.txt#myndert">partner</a> in a patent for a substantial plot of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> around the site of today's Poughkeepsie. He <a href="http://www.hudsonrivervalley.org/review/pdfs/hvrr_3pt2_mcdermott.pdf">later</a> built a sawmill there. As late as 1691, he granted a mortgage on a part of his Dutchess County holdings. At that time he was <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/114555753/">identified</a> as "Myndert Harmense Vandenbogert, of Albany, gunstocker." No longer apparent in the Albany city records, he probably relocated to Poughkeepsie where he is <a href="http://www.conovergenealogy.com/dkcances/dkcances-o/p275.htm#i159670">said</a> to have died between 1710 and 1712.</p>
