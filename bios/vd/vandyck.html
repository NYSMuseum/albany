<P>Over several generations, the Albany members of the <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> ancestry and variously <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elled <a href="#sources"><b>Van Dyck</b></a> family are best known as surgeons and <a href="../../trades/medical.html">physicians</a>. Perhaps <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22hendrick+thomasse+van+dyke%22">Hendrick Thomasse Van Dyke</a>" was the first American member of the family.</p>

<p>New Amsterdam native <a href="cvdyck821.html">Cornelis Van Dyck</a> was sent to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> to to serve as a surgical apprentice under his sister's husband. His sons and their sons became "physicians" in Albany and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.</p>

<P>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, five Van Dyck men were <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/ny/albany/census/cens1720.txt">identified</a> as freeholders in Albany County. <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#822">Two</a> of them lived in Albany's first and <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#824">second</a> wards.

      <p>Born in 1726, <a href="hvdyck830.html">Hendrick Van Dyck</a> married a <a href="../s/maschuyler1491.html">Schuyler</a> 
        and followed his father to medical practice in Albany. However, Hendrick's 
        life was cut short when he drowned in 1707. His son <a href="covdyck822.html">Cornelis</a> 
        was an Albany mainstay who may have practiced medicine. Another <a href="davdyck824.html">son</a> 
        was an Albany trader who connected the family to the regional elite when 
        he married a Ten Broeck <a href="../t/chtbroeck24.html">daughter</a> in 
        1718. After the death of her husband, <a href="../s/maschuyler1491.html">Maria 
        Schuyler Van Dyck</a> relocated her family to Kinderhook where they intermarried and became prominent residents. </p>

        <BR>
<p>For most of the eighteenth century, one "Dr." Van Dyck practiced medicine in <a href="http://www.nyhistory.net/drums/vandyke.htm">
        Schenectady</a>, <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>, in large <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>, and in <a href="http://njgsbc.org/files/BCFamilies/BCFam-VanDyke.pdf">New Jersey</a> and elsewhere. Van Dyck <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22van+dyck%22++%22daughter+of%22+albany">daughters</a> became wives and mothers of these regional families as well.</p>
		
<p><a href="hvdyck832.html">Henry Van Dyck</a> was the last of the the Van Dyck physicians. Like the generations of before him, his practice <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#patients">reached deeply</a> into the community. By that time, more enlightened <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> had eclipsed the locally trained Albany physicians. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2156">1790</a>, the Court Street household of Henry's <a href="../d/mgtdouw2156.html">widow</a> was the only Van Dyck family left in the city!</p>

<p>Traditional medical mainstays for almost 150 years, these Van Dycks were well known in Albany and in its <a href="../../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a>.</p>
