<strong>Harpert Jacobse Van Deusen</strong></a> probably was born during the 1660s or early 70s. He was an older son in the large family of New Amsterdam residents <a href="javdu5536.html">Jacob Abrahamse</a> and <a href="caveslant6506.html">Catharina Van Eslant</a> Van Deusen. Even into the 1700s, he often was referred to as "Harpert Jacobse" perhaps to distinguish him from a younger, same-named nephew who also <a href="havdu5530.html">lived</a> in Albany. 

<p>In January 1695, he married <a href="../g/magerr6025.html">Maria Gerrits</a> at the Albany 
<a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1715, ten children had been christened in Albany where he was a member and church <a href="../../drc.html#deacons">officer</a>.

<p>Harpert Jacobse (alternatively "Herpert") was idenified as a merchant as early as 1687. He raised his family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where he was a <a href="../../census1697.html#069">mainstay</a> for several decades. Assessments <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5529">valued</a> his property comparable to that of other successful <a href="../../furtrade.html">traders</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5529">1699</a>, he joined with his neighbors in pledging allegiance to the king of England. 

<p>Beginning in 1695, he began a close association with the Albany government when he first was elected assessor for the third ward. He served as assessor for many years and also as collector, contactor, and juror. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1708">1708</a>, he was elected assistant alderman. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#5529">1715</a>, "harp't Jacobse" was included among the members of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>In 1707, he was said to have been a resident of Claverack. But freeholder lists from<a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5529"> 1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5529">1742</a> continued to identify him as a resident of Albany's second ward.  


<p>Harpert Jacobse Van Deusen died in July 1742 and was buried beneath his church. In 1747, his property was referenced along with the "heirs of Harpert Jacobse" in the <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">will</a> of his former neighbor. His widow lived until 1750.</p>
