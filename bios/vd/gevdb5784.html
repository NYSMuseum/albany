      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gerrit Gysbertse </strong></a> probably 
        was born during the 1640s. He most likely was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New 
        Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="gyvdb.html">Gysbert Vandenbergh</a>. He was called Gerrit Gysbertse 
        to prevent confusion with a number of other "Gerrit Vandenberghs" living 
        in the Albany area. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#5784">1674</a>, he was among 
        those invited to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer along with his 
        father and brother 
      <p>About 1664, he married Teuntje Gysberts. By 1688, the marriage had produced 
        at least thirteen children - some of whom were christened at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member. Several 
        of his children became Albany residents. 
      <p>He lived near Albany but perhaps not within the actual <a href="../../citylimits.html">city 
        limits</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1683ssl">1683</a> and 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">1689</a>, he was identified 
        as a farmer - perhaps living on <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle 
        Island</a>. In <a href="../../census1697.html#5784">1697</a>, his household 
        included five children and was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
      <p>Gerrit Gysbertse Vandenbergh died sometime after 1697. We seek information 
        on his passing. 
      <p>Although, perhaps not technically a city resident, his sketch is included 
        here because he was the father of a large Albany family. </p>
