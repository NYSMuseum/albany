<P>Albany mason <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gysbert Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born during the late 1600s - probably within a few years of 1690. He was the son of <a href="cogvdb5718.html">Cornelis G.</a> and  his second wife <a href="covdp6245.html">Cornelia Vanderpoel</a> Vandenbergh. His baptism does not appear to have been recorded in extant <a href="../../churches.html">church</a> records. Named for his pioneer <a href="gyvdb.html">grandfather</a>, Gysbert Cornelisse grew up in a large combined family in <a href="../../census1679.html#5718">Albany</a> and on his father's farm in surrounding <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.

<p>In February 1712, he was among those who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willdivisscher4067.html">will</a> of a neighbor. In 1714, he was among the eight living children named in the <a href="../../wills/willcogvdb.html">will</a> filed by his father.

<p>His wife was Catharina (perhaps <a href="../vh/vh.html">Van Hoesen</a>). Between 1712 and 1729, six of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents were pewholders and frequent baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1715">1715</a>, he was named firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. He was appointed again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">1729</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5796">1720</a> and again in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5796">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders in the third ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5796">1763</a>, this <a href="#long">long-lived</a> individual was identified as a freeholder in "Albany."

<p>In August <a href="http://books.google.com/books?lpg=PA110&dq=%22guysbert+vanden%22+bergh&pg=PA110&id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&ots=ssp_5u99Tk#v=onepage&q=%22guysbert%20of%20banden%22%20bergh&f=false">1743</a>, he was contracted by the city <a href="../../corporation.html">corp</a>oration to set up 600 <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html#stk">stockadoes</a> on the south side of the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> in the direction of the <a href="../../loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a>.

<p>In May 1749, he was <a href="../../wills/willwyvdb5872.html">named</a> co-executor of the estate of his <a href="wyvdb5872.html">brother</a> - a bricklayer. Another co-executor, brother <a href="wmvdb5861.html">Wilhelmus</a>, was a mason. In <a href="../../census1756.html#295">1756</a>, a census of city householders identified "Gisbt. Vanderbarack" as a <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">mason</a> and the principal of a third ward home that appears to have had five rooms and three fireplaces.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>, his property in the third ward was valued modestly on the city assessment roll. During those years, Gysbert's lot in the West Manor was valued modestly as well.

<p>After the 1760s, the name of Gysbert Vandenbergh no longer was found on the community rolls. We seek information on his passing.</p>
