<P>The Albany <a href="#sources">Vandenbergh</a> family represents a smaller part of a very very large (perhaps the most numerous <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> family) regional family group. Vandenberghs also were prominent in lower New York and New Jersey. 

<p>The family has several possible origins in the annals of New Netherland. Before 1700, family members often were known by their "patronymic" as "Gysbertse" or "Willemse" or "Gerritse" or "Claese!" After that, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">spellings</a> of the Vandenbergh name have varied widely/wildly.
 
      <p>Because of the possible multiple origins of the Vandenbergh family, those 
        eventually known by the surname "Vandenbergh" were very numerous and widely 
        encountered in the general region. However, because they were not exceptionally 
        wealthy or well-connected, a smaller proportion <a href="../../criteria.html">inhabited</a> 
        the city of Albany.
		
<p>In 1679, three or four family households were included on the Albany <a href="../../census1679.html">census of householders</a>. They were the sons of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> tenant <a href="gyvdb.html">Gysbert Cornelisse</a> "van den Hoogenberch."

<p>By <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, the family had spread out into the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">countryside</a> leaving two households within the Albany city borders.

<p>By the 1720s, a number of family members had become residents of the farming community located at the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#28">1756</a>, as many as seven Albany households were headed by a Vandenbergh family <a href="../../res/sp.html">member</a>. 
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, three Vandenbergh-named 
        households were listed on the Albany city census. Eleven more were enumerated 
        in surrounding <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>.</p>
      <p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA92,M1">1813</a>, 
        five Vandenbergh households were listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city 
        directory</a>. They were: Jack Vandenberg, 11 Van Tromp; John Vandenberg, 
        grocer, 78 Quay; John Vandenberg, joiner, 7 Pearl; Richard Vandenberg, 
        laborer, 23 Van Schaick; and widow Ann Vandenberg, at 50 Orange.</p>
      <p>Numerous place and organization names across the country recall this 
        early Albany family today.</p>

        is derived chiefly from <a href="../../fhg.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. The most recent word among printed resources appears to be <i>The van den Berghs in America</i>. complied by D. Wade Stockman, Robert L. Grunwell, and Betsy S.

We have yet to uncover a digital version of that work. Under evaluation are <a href="http://users.crocker.com/~jcamp/ggvb.html">Internet
