<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elsje Van Den Uythoff</b></a> was born during the mid-seventeenth century. She was the daughter of Beverwyck baker <a href="woavdu.html">Wouter Albertse</a> Van Den Uythoff. By the 1660s, her father had re-married and she was raised in the second ward home of her stepmother, widow <a href="../h/elizhendrix.html">Elizabeth Hendrix Lansing</a>. </p>


<p>By the mid-1680s, she had married Albany native <a href="../l/geglansing3698.html">Gerrit G. Lansing</a> - one of the sons of his stepmother. Over the next two decades, the marriage produced nine children.</p>

<p>These Lansings lived on the hill in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Gerrit's baking and trading made them Albany mainstays. Both wife and husband had grown up in close proximity to Albany bakeries.</p>

<p>Elsje Van Den Uythoff Lansing was accounted for in the household of her husband on the Albany census of <a href="../../census1697.html#154">1697</a>. Her husband died in July 1708. She may have passed by that time as her name had dropped from Albany records.</p>
