<strong>Arent Van Dyck</strong></a> was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on January 5, 1700. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="hvdyck830.html">Hendrick</a> and <a href="../s/maschuyler1491.html">Maria Schuyler</a> Van Dyck. His father was a prominent surgeon, trader, and official  who drowned in the river in 1707 when Arent was still six years old. His widowed mother lived in Albany for a time but then moved her family to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> where she died in 1742. 

<p>On November 1722, he married Hilltetie (Alida) <a href="../va/vallen.html">Van Allen</a> in Albany. By 1738, six children had been christened in Albany and beyond.

<p>This Van Dyck family made its home in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> where Arent's holdings were valued on the assessment roll of 1744. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources have noted that Arent Van Dyck also was a <a href="../../trades/medical.html">physician</a> practicing in Kinderhook.  Into the 1740s, he still had some financial dealings with the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a>.

<p>Arent Van Dyck died in November 1769. He had lived almost seventy years.</p>
