<P>This Albany resident named <a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes Vanderheyden</strong></a> probably was born in New York City in July or August 1702. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MacxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA491&lpg=PA491&dq=%22III.&source=bl&ots=u3BMgafoZi&sig=uiz3w3JVz6K9x_ejnN-Xk214Cns&hl=en&sa=X&ei=163_Ud7DJ9Kv4AOGtYCAAg&ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=rachel&f=false">Thus</a>, he would have been the son of Johannes and Mary Woodard Vanderheyden. He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been sent to Albany following the death of his father (in September 1702) to live with the family of his father's kinsman, Albany mainstay <a href="divdh5681.html">Dirck Vanderheyden</a> who had married <a href="../k/raketel4648.html">Rachel Ketelhuyn</a> Vanderheyden. This sketch presents information on the life of the Albany attorney who died in 1771 and was sometimes known as "Johannes Vanderheyden, Jr."

<p>According to family-based <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MacxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA491&lpg=PA491&dq=%22III.&source=bl&ots=u3BMgafoZi&sig=uiz3w3JVz6K9x_ejnN-Xk214Cns&hl=en&sa=X&ei=163_Ud7DJ9Kv4AOGtYCAAg&ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22III.&f=false">resources</a>, Johannes was part of a group sent to trade in the Indian country during the summer of 1723.

<p>In January 1724, this individual married his cousin <a href="ravdh5707.html">Rachel Vanderheyden</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1748, that marriage had produced nine children who were christened at the Albany church where both parents were regular baptism sponsors.  However, Rachel died a few years later in 1754. In August 1758, Johannes may have re-married. His second wife would have been Mary Butler. That wedding took place at the Dutch church in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and identified the groom as an "advocatt van Albany." 

<p>In 1749, he was licensed to practice <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a> in New York. In 1756, this Johannes Vanderheyden was <a href="../../census1756.html#252">identified</a> as an attorney and would practice law in Albany for more than twenty years, Except for a time during the early 1730s, he lived in the <a href="../../wards.html"1">first ward</a> and was <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1">qualified</a> to vote and headed the list of Albany freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a>.

<p>He <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">served</a> the community in a number of <a href="../../org/cc.html#1725">offices</a> and was elected alderman in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1737">1737</a>.  

<p>Johannes filed a <a href="../../wills/willjovdh5697.html">will</a> in March 1771. It named four children as his heirs. According to the family bible, Johannes Vanderheyden died on July 24, 1771.</p>

The life of this Johannes <a href="vdh.html">Vanderheyden</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 5697. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.

        <p><a name=origins></a><b>Origins</b>: We think that the Johannes born in 1707 
          (most likely did not survive to adulthood) would not have married his 
          older <a href="ravdh5707.html">sister</a> who was born in 1703. This 
          exposition on his background relies on a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MacxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA491&lpg=PA491&dq=%22III.&source=bl&ots=u3BMgafoZi&sig=uiz3w3JVz6K9x_ejnN-Xk214Cns&hl=en&sa=X&ei=163_Ud7DJ9Kv4AOGtYCAAg&ved=0CEoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=rachel&f=false">family-based 
          work</a> that we currently find plausible.
