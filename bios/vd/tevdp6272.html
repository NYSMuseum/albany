<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Teunis Cornelisse </strong></a> is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in Holland in 1618. <a href="http://www.illian.org/places/FamilySheets/d0396/F84820.html">Perhaps</a> he was the first child born to Gerrit and Cornelia Wynants Vanderpoel of Amsterdam, Holland. 

<p>By 1600, Teunis (Anthoneus) Cornelisse had emigrated to New Netherland and had settled in the vicinity of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he subscribed to a <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#6272">petition</a> seeking more freedom in the fur trade. He was <a href="#known">kn</a>own as Teunis Cornelisse and was a member of what became the Vanderpoel family. He probably was the older brother of <a href="wygvdp6276.html">Wynant Gerritse</a> Vanderpoel - patriarch of the early Albany family.

<p>His wife was Catharina Jansen Croon. The couple had three daughters who married Albany area residents. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Teunis Cornelisse was appointed commissary of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in 1670. In 1671, he was named one of the magistrates of Albany. He owned half of Constapel Island but lived north of Albany where he had at least one mill. In 1683, a community survey <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1683ssl">document</a> stated that he lived outside the north gate of Albany.  

<p>Teunis Cornelissen filed a will in June 1687. It identified his wife and three daughters as his heirs. He was dead by 1694 when his widow filed her will.
