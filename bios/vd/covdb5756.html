<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in June 1707. He was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="covdb5644.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../w/mawinne3008.html">Maria Winne</a> Vandenbergh. His father died that same year and his mother re-married. However, his <a href="../g/jagerr6008.html">step-father</a> died in 1725 as Cornelis was reaching adulthood. As the <a href="advdb5719.html">only son</a> still living in the Albany area, he was called on to help his mother administer her holdings.

<p>Cornelis married Rachel De Ridder in March 1733. Their six children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1735 and 1749. Beyond church-related references, his name sems to have been absent from community based records.

<p>In 1745, he was named to receive several bequests in the <a href="../../wills/willmawinne3008.html">will</a> of his mother. He also was named co-executor of her estate.

<p>After witnessing a baptism in 1749, the name of Cornelis Vandenbergh probably dropped from Albany rolls except for in May 1762, when Cornelius Vandenbergh witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willcobeekman.html">will</a> of Neeltie Van Vechten.
