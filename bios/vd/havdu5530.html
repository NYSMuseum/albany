<strong>Harpert Van Deusen</strong></a> probably was born during the 1680s. He was the son of <a href="meavd5564.html">Melgert Abrahamse</a> and <a href="../vw/envwoert2511.html">Engeltie Van Woert</a> Van Deusen. He grew up just outside of and also in Albany. He probably was included in his father's <a href="../../census1697.html#009">household</a> on the city census of 1697. This boy was called "Harpert Van Deusen Jr" to distinguish him from an older uncle who was known as "<a href="havdu5529.html">Harpert Jacobse</a>."

<p>In November 1708, Harpert Jr. married Helena Van Deusen at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as living in "Claverack." By 1728, their seven children had been christened at the church in Albany.  Helena died in June 1728 and was buried in the church. In May 1732, he wed Teuntie Van Alstyne. That marriage probably produced no more children.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as  a member of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5530">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5530">1742</a>, his name was inclued on lists of Albany freeholders. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1724">1724</a>, he was appointed firemaster. 

<p>In 1732, he was granted letters of administration on the estate of Gerrit Vandenbergh.

<p>The name of Harpert Van Deusen, Jr. has not been found in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a> after 1742. We seek information on his later life and passing.</p>
