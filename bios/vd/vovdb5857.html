<strong>Volkie Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in March 1723. She was the daughter of <a href="wyvdb5872.html">Wynant</a> and <a href="../vh/vovh6418.html">Volkie Van Hoesen</a> Vandenbergh. She was the last of eight children born to a <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> brickmaker. 

<p>This youngest daughter of a middling Albany family did not marry. She was one of five children named in the <a href="../../wills/willwyvdb5872.html">will</a> filed by her father in May 1749. She was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Both of her parents were dead by 1758.

<p>Beginning during the 1760s, Volkie and her sister <a href="cavdb1707.html">Catharina</a> were named as owners of property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>.  The property that passed to Wynant's children is shown under various owners on <a href="../../census1790.html#vdbsis">census</a> and tax records. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5857">1788</a>, Volkie's third ward lot was valued on the assessment roll.

<p>Probably living with her widowed sister, an aged and un-married Volkie Vandenbergh survived into the 1790s and possibly later.</p>
