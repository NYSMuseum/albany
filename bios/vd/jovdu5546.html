      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Van Deusen</strong></a> was born 
        in February 1717. He was the first son of Mattheus and Engeltie Slingerland 
        Van Deusen. A number of same-named individuals were living in greater 
        Albany County during his lifetime. 
      <p>In April 1745, he married <a href="../w/mawinne3012.html">Maria Winne</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents 
        were occasional baptism sponsors. At that time, he was identified as a 
        <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a>. By 1753, three children 
        had been christened in Albany. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1752">1752</a>, he was appointed firemaster 
        for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Over the next two 
        decades, his accounts were paid from the city treasury. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#178">1756</a>, the property of this 
        carpenter was described on a census of Albany householders taken by the 
        British army. 
      <p>In 1763, the <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#5546">name</a> of "John 
        van duzen" appeared on a list of Albany freeholders near those of some 
        of his first ward neighbors. During the 1760s, his first ward property 
        was valued on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment 
        rolls</a>. The <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lY1YAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA92&lpg=PA92&dq=%22johannes+van+deusen%22&source=bl&ots=uQWNoLRZyQ&sig=DX8GRXBKRl9pI0N3fFqKFEorh8s&hl=en&ei=rN9ISrrIEZPIMbHjhLMK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10">name</a> 
        of this city resident is absent from city-based assessments from 1779 
        and afterwards. 
      <p>At the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he would have been past his fifty-eighth 
        birthday and too old for active service. 
      <p>Johannes Van Deusen has not been found in the community based <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a> 
        from after the war. However, in 1790 the household of John Van Dusen was 
        <a href="../../census1790.html#5546">configured</a> on the census for 
        Watervliet. </p>
