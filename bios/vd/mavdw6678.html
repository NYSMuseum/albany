<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Vanderwerken</b></a> probabaly was born during the 1670s. She was the daughter of Albany residents Roeloff Gerritse and Jeertruy Jacobs Vanderwerken.</p>


<p>In May 1698, she married a Barbados-born <a href="../../garrison.html">soldier</a> named <a href="../k/jokid5976.html">John Kidney</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1708, four children had been baptized at the Albany church where Maria was a member.</p>

<p>These Kidneys lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> in a <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5976">neighborhood</a> populated by soldiers and others connected to the fort.</a> 

<p>Her husband had died by 1722, when she received letters of administration on his estate. She also received a monetary bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willjrosie.html">will</a> of Jan Rosie filed in 1737.</p>

<p>Maria Vanderwerken Kidney may have lived until November 1760 when her son, Roeloff Kidney, paid for a pall to bury his mother!</p>
