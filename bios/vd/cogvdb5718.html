<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Gysbertse</strong></a> was born during the 1650s. He was the son of <a href="gyvdb.html">Gysbert Cornelise</a> and Elizabeth. In time, he would be known by the surname <a  href="vdb.html">Vandenbergh</a>.
 
<p>About 1675, he married Levintje Lennon in New York. That marriage produced at least two children before her passing. About 1684, he took for his second wife <a href="covdp6245.html">Cornelia Wynants Vanderpoel</a>. That union produced at least six children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#5718">1679</a>, he was identified as the head of an Albany household. In 1687, he signed a petition submitted by Albany-based <a href="../../furtrade.html">traders</a>. However, by <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, his primary residence was listed on the census as <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. At the same time, subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a> also valued his Albany property.
 
<p>In 1695, he had been named co-executor of his <a href="wygvdp6276.html">father-in-law</a>'s estate. Cornelis Gysbertse Vandenbergh filed his own <a href="../../wills/willcogvdb.html">will</a> in March 1714. He identified himself as of "Rensselaerswyck Manor." It noted his land in Albany and New York and also his "homefarm" one mile in on the east side of the Hudson. The will passed probate in July 1717.</p>
