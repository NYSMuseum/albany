<strong>Cornelis Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in October 1719. He was the son of Albany-area residents Mathias and Catharina Van Deusen Vandenbergh. We have referred to him as Cornelis M. Vandenbergh to prevent confusion with a number of same-named contemporary kinsmen.<p>

<p>In August 1741, he married Rachel <a href="../b/bradt.html">Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Although, early in the marriage, they appeared as baptism sponsors, their marriage may have produced only one child. In February 1747, Cornelis M. may have married Cornelia Vandenbergh in New York City. At that time, he was called a widower.  By 1766, seven more children had been christened in the church where he was a member and pewholder.

<p>In 1749, he deeded water rights to land in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> to his brother, Rutger.

<p>In 1767, his name (Cornelis M.) appeared on a muster roll for an east side of Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In 1769, he sold an interest in a "negro man" to Rutgert Vandenbergh.

<p>Perhaps he was among the Cornelis Vandenberghs listed on the Watervliet census in <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">1790</a>.

<p>Cornelis M. Vandenbergh may have been buried in January 1792 along with his brother and wife.</p>

The life of Cornelis M. <a href="vdb.html">Vandenbergh</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 5760. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Because so many same-named individuals were living in the region at that time, at this point, we must assign only information on Cornelis M. to this biography.
