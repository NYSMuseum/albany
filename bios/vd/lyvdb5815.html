      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Lydia Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in 
        August 1737. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="gevdb5783.html">Gerrit 
        C.</a> and <a href="../vv/mgtvvechten2550.html">Margarita Van Vechten</a> 
        Vandenbergh. She was a middle child in the large family of a third ward 
        wagonner and office holder. After a while, her parents moved their home 
        to a <a href="../../im/im1767.html">farm</a> in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">manor</a>. 
      <p>Although only twenty-one in November 1758, she was identified as a "spinster" 
        when she married <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> native 
        and then Albany merchant <a href="../r/piryckman1985.html">Pieter Ryckman</a>. 
        By 1777, at least six children were christened at the at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where she was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor. 
      <p>These Ryckmans made their home on <a href="../../streets.html#green">Green 
        Street</a>. But Peter was an Indian interpreter and messenger to the Iroquois 
        - thus spending considerable time on the frontier before and after the 
        <a href="../../or/or-bh.html">War</a> for Independence. Their <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a> home was an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#1985">fixture</a> 
        although Peter Ryckman frequently was absent. Thus, Lydia also shared 
        her house with a number of adult kin. 
      <p>Lydia Vandenbergh Ryckman lost her husband at the beginning of 1811. 
        Over the next two decades, <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> 
        identified her as the head of Albany homes at 27 Green Street and at other 
        locations on the South side of Albany. The Albany census for 1820 listed 
        her and two other older adults in her Southside home. In 1827, her son, 
        <a href="../r/wiryckman1996.html">Wilhelmus Ryckman</a>, also lived at 
        her address. 
      <p>Born in 1737, on August 16, 1836 the Albany newspaper <a href="https://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany10inmuns/annalsofalbany10inmuns_djvu.txt">reported</a> 
        that "Mrs. Lydia Ryckman" died at the age of 99!
