<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dirck Vanderheyden</strong></a> was christened at the Albany Dutch <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> on Junuary 7, 1694. He was the son of <a href="divdh5681.html">Dirck</a> and <a href="../k/raketel4648.html">Rachel Ketelhuyn</a> Vanderheyden. This fifth child grew up in a large family in the first ward home of a former frontier trader-turned-businessman and contractor. By 1720, perhaps Dirck Sr. had removed his remaining family to a <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> farm.

<p>By that time, Dirck Jr. seemed to be cementing his ties to Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#5682">1715</a>, the name "Dirck Van Der Hyden Junier" appeared on the roster of an Albany-based troop of horse. His father also belonged to that company.

<p>In April 1716, he married Albany native <a href="../b/egbradt4348.html">Egbertie Bradt</a> also at the Albany church. Their only daughter was christened there at the end of July.

<p>During the 1730s and 40s (until 1746), he seems to have been involved in <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real property</a> transactions with his brothers regarding family property at what is now Troy (formerly Vanderheyden) or <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>.  

<p>After that, the name of Dirck Vanderheyden has not yet been encountered in our sweep of the community-based record. His wife seems to have maintained her ties to their Albany church and was buried from there in August of 1760. </p>
