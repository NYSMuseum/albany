<P><a href="#sources"><b>Mattheus Abrahamse</b></a> (Tewisse Abrahamse) was born in 1631. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland pioneers</a> Abraham Pieterse and Tryntje Melchoir Van Deusen.</p>


<p>About 1653, he married Helena Roberts. Ten of their children were alive in 1686 - all born before surviving baptism records for the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> begin in 1683. However, both parents were members of the Albany church by that time.</p>

<p>In 1656, he was granted a lot in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. It was located on the west side of what became <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> - north of Maiden Lane. <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#5561">1660</a>, his name appeared on a petition signed by Beverwyck area fur traders. However, within a decade he had relocated to the Claverack area where he leased land from <a href="../l/rlivingston94.html">Robert Livingston</a>.</p>

<p>At the notary's <a href="../b/jjbecker6030.html">house</a> in Albany, Mattheus Abrahamse Van Deusen filed a will in June 1686. At that time, he called himself a "Claverack farmer." It left his estate to his wife and then directed an equal partition among his ten living children - whose names and ages were specified at that time. He probably died after 1700!</p>
