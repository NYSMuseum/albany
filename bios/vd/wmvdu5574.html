      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Willem Jacobse</strong></a> was born about 
        1670. He was an older son in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New 
        Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="javdu5536.html">Jacob Abrahamse</a> and 
        <a href="../vd/caveslant6506.html">Catalyntie Van Eslant</a> Van Deusen. 
        He probably was born in New York and came to Albany with his family prior 
        to <a href="../../census1679.html#5536">1679</a> when his father was identified 
        as householder. 
      <p>He married <a href="../r/elroseboom1598.html">Elizabeth Roseboom</a> 
        in January 1692. By 1705, the marriage had produced seven children who 
        were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        where he was a member and church officer. 
      <p>These Van Deusens set up their home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a> in a house on Pearl Street where they were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#132">mainstays</a> 
        for several decades. Willem Jacobse's holdings were accorded a moderate 
        assessment on city <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5574">tax rolls</a>. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5574">1699</a>, he joined with other 
        Albany people in swearing allegiance to the king of England. 
      <p>He served his community as a juror, assessor, firemaster, and, in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1711">1711</a>, 
        was elected assistant alderman. He also belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5574">1720</a>, his name 
        was included on a list of Albany freeholders. 
      <p>Willem Jacobse Van Deusen died in September 1731 and was buried from 
        his church. </p>
