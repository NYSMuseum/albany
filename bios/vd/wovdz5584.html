<P><a href="#sources"><b>Wouter Vanderzee</b></a> was born during the early 1670s. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="svdz.html">Storm</a> and <a href="../l/hilansing3400.html">Hilletie Lansing</a> Vanderzee. His father died in 1679 and his mother soon re-married. However, Storm's children received bequests in their father's will.</p>


<p>In July 1695, Wouter married <a href="../s/jaswart484.html">Jannetje Swart</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor. The marriage produced nine children who joined their parents at the Albany church.</p>

<p>His family's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household was configured on the Albany census in <a href="../../census1697.html#010">1697</a>. Two years later, he signed an <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5584">oath</a> swearing loyalty to the King of England. He was identified as a merchant, sometimes called "Walter," and served on an Albany jury.</p>

<p>He was listed on the roster of an <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a> company in 1715. However, his name is absent from Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#compsur">assessment rolls</a> for that period. In 1706, he purchased half of a plot on the "Oniquothe creek" called "the Heath or Hay Flat."</p> 

<p>Wouter Vanderzee died after 1719 when his last child was born. He may be the "Wouter Vandersee" listed on a list of <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">freeholders</a> in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> in 1720!</p>
