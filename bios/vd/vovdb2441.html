<strong>Volkert Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in December 1704. He was the son of <a href="wyvdb5872.html">Wynant W.</a> and <a href="../vh/vovh6418.html">Volkie Van Hoesen</a> Vandenbergh. He was an older son in a large family of a <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> brickmaker and property holder. He was named in the <a href="../../wills/willwyvdb5872.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1749. At that time, his mother was dead but four siblings also were named to inherit his father's estate. 

<p>His wife was <a href="#huyck">Catharina Huyck</a>. Between 1730 and 1748, eight children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where they were regular baptism sponsors. 

<p>These Vandenberghs raised their family in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> but he seems to have gained control over his father's brickyard and other Albany property as well. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2441">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#2441">1763</a>, he was counted among the Rensselaerswyck freeholders. In 1747, his lot on the <a href="../../loc/northend.html#road">road</a> leading to the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> was noted in the <a href="../../wills/willstvr.html">will</a> of the Patroon. During the 1760s, Volkert Vandenbergh was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">listed</a> as the owner of third ward lots.

<p>In September 1766, he filed a <a href="../../wills/willvovdb2441.html">will</a>. Living in Rensselaerswyck, it stated that he was sickly.  A substantial estate was divided among his five living children. His wife probably had died as she was not mentioned in the will.

<p>Volkert Vandenbergh was dead by July 16, 1767 when his will passed probate.</p>
