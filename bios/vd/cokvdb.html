<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis K. Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in September 1720. He was the son of Albany residents Claes and Anna Hooghkerk Vandenbergh. He was known as "Cornelis K. or <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5762">C.</a>" (the son of Claes) to prevent confusion with several same-named contemporary cousins.

<p>Unlike most mainline community residents, Cornelis K. did not <a href="../../marriages.html">marry</a>. He was, however, a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Without a family of his own, he lived in his parent's home on lower <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. In 1744, he was named constable in the first ward. In 1751, he served as one of the ward's <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemasters</a>. During the 1760s, he was noted on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> within the household of his father.    <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="early adulthood - in-progress"></a> &nbsp; By the 1770s, he had become head of the State Street home. Aided by <a href="../../census1790.html#crvdb">servants</a>, he lived there until his death.

<p>Aged fifty-five at the outbreak of the war, he supported the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">crusade</a> for American liberties with financial contributions. However, he was paid for actual service to the cause in 1784.

<p>After the war, he resumed trading. In 1784, he received imported goods from Ireland for sale at the <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm Tree Corner</a>. His holdings were valued on post-war assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5762">rolls</a> as well.

<p>In April 1788, he joined with other Albany antifederalists in publishing a <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#5762">list</a> of their objections to the proposed constitution.

<p>His house was destroyed during the downtown <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html">fire</a> of 1793. At that time, he shared the building with merchant-tailor Giles K. Porter.
 
  
<p>Cornelis K. Vandenbergh's died in September 1796 at the age of seventy-six. He was buried on March 1 in the Dutch church cemetery. His will passed probate two days later. Without direct descendants, it named several cousins as his beneficiaries.
