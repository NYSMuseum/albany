      <P>This individual was called <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jan Cornelisse</strong></a> 
        and probably was born about 1650. He also was known as "Jan Van der hoeve." 
        Perhaps, he was the brother of Albany mainstay <a href="covdho6667.html">Cornelis 
        Vanderhoeven</a> and the son of widow Geertje Van Fulpen who <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Flats/5732/WilsonLedley.html">arrived</a> 
        in New Amsterdam with her children in 1661. Jan is said to have lived 
        in New Amsterdam and then relocated to Albany about 1671. 
      <p>His wife was Dorothe Jans. They had six children christened at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1683 and 1694. Additional 
        children may have been born to the couple earlier - prior to the existence 
        of surviving baptism records for the Albany Reformed church. From 1683 
        on, he was a member, contributor, and regular baptism sponsor at the Albany 
        church. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#jocvdho">1684</a>, his Albany 
        taxes were in arrears. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1694">1694</a>, he 
        served as a constable in Albany. However, his name does not appear on 
        Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1679">survey</a> documents from 
        that time. 
      <P>Jan Cornelisse Vanderhoeven later removed to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. 
        We seek information on his origins, later life, and passing.</p>
