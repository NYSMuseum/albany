<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Vanderheyden</strong></a> was born in April 1737. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="davdh5677.html">David</a> 
        and <a href="../v/geervisscher4125.html"> Geertruy Visscher</a> Vanderheyden. 
        His <a href="ravdh5712.html">sister</a> married Dr. Samuel Stringer.</p>
      <p>As a young man, he followed other family members into <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec"> 
        business</a>. In 1766, he was suspected of seeking the commission as Stamp 
        Tax collector. Over the next half century, he became a successful, import 
        <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchant</a>. In 1772, he was a lieutenant 
        in the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> regiment 
        of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. 
      <p>Although in the prime of his life during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> 
        for Independence, we <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information 
        on his wartime activities. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty 
        right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5691">regiment</a> 
        of the militia. 
      <p><a href="../../loc/vdhpalace.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/bldg/vdhpal.jpg" align=right border=0 vspace=1 hspace=1 width=200 alt="Vanderheyden Palace - 85 North Pearl Street"></a>He 
        first <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5691">lived</a> in the <a href="../../census1790.html#5691">third 
        ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#5691">1790</a>, he was still 
        living in the heart of the Market Street business district. But by the 
        end of the century, he had <a href="../../census1800.html#5691">settled</a> 
        into a large traditional home on Pearl Street that would become known 
        as <a href="../../loc/vdhpalace.html">Vanderheyden Palace</a>. That location 
        was on the west side of what became North Pearl Street and remained his 
        home for most (if not all) of the rest of his life. In August 1797, the 
        Albany <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">paper</a> reported that <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> 
        destroyed the house owned by Gerardus Lansing that was then occupied by 
        "<a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#columbia">Jacob Vanderheyden, Esq.</a>" 
        on Columbia Street. 
      <p>He was in his thirties when he married a much younger <a href="../l/jalivingston8607.html">Janet 
        Livingston</a>. By 1789, the marriage had produced four children who were 
        christened in <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>. Jacob 
        was a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> and also was associated with <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. 
        Peter's</a> Episcopal church. 
      <p>In 1782, Jacob Vanderheyden advertized in the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a>. 
        Stating that he was a merchant in Pearl Street and was located next to 
        "Schuyler's tavern," he offered blankets, linen, wine and rum, buttons, 
        paper, and rock salt. In trade, he accepted money, country produce, or 
        "Mr. Morris's notes." A subsequent ad offered mill saws, groceries, and 
        dry goods. He served as assessor and as one of the first directors of 
        the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>. 
      <p>Jacob Vanderheyden died in September 1820 and was buried from his residence 
        at 85 North Pearl Street. His widow remained in their landmark house until 
        her passing in 1823.</p>

The life of Jacob <a href="vdh.html">Vanderheyden</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 5691. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. He should not be confused with the founder of Troy who had the same name (but was the son of Dirck not David) and was born in 1758 and died in 1809.
