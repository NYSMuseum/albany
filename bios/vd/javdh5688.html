<strong>Jacob Tyssen</strong></a> was the patriarch of the <a href="vdh.html">Vanderheyden</a> family of early Albany. Claiming he was sixty -years-old in 1677, perhaps he was born in Europe about 1617. His father was Matthys.

<p>His first wife is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been Elsje Berrits. In 1655, he married <a href="../h/anhals.html">Anna Hals</a> and they emigrated to New Netherland. By 1675, that union had produced eight children.

<p>Beginning during the late 1650s, he appeared frequently before the <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cmb">courts</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#5688">1660</a>, he was identified as one of the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur</a> traders advocating more liberal trading policies. Earlier, he also was known as a tailor.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#5688">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. In <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#inhabitants">1681</a>, he was among the Albany burghers who  signed a petition advocating more structure for the fur trade. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#5688">1684</a>, he was exempted from taxes because his house had burned down. During these years, he owned and sold a number of pieces of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> in and around Albany.  

<p>Jacob Tysse Vanderheyden died in October 1687 and was buried in the church plot. His widow <a href="../../census1697.html#080">survived</a> for many years. His third ward lot was valued on the Albany assessment roll in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>. </p>
