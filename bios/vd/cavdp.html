      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Catharina Vanderpoel</strong></a> probably 
        was born during the 1650s. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New 
        Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="wygvdp6276.html">Wynant Gerritse</a> 
        and Tryntje Melgerse Vanderpoel. 
      <p>By the late 1670s, she had married <a href="wgvdb5641.html">Willem Gysbertse 
        Vandenbergh</a>. By 1698, eight children had been christened at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. 
      <p>These Vandenberghs were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#070">mainstays</a> 
        who lived for many decades in the community's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North 
        End</a>. 
      <p>In 1695, her father was living in New York when he filed his <a href="../../wills/willwygvdp.html">will</a>. 
        Her husband was named executor but Catharina was not identified in the 
        calendar entry of the document. 
      <p>However, Catharina Vanderpoel Vandenbergh was named executor of her husband's 
        estate in his <a href="../../wills/willwgvdb5641.html">will</a> filed 
        in March 1714. She died sometime thereafter.</p>
