<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Adam Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in September 1703. He was the son of Albany residents Cornelis and <a href="../w/mawinne3008.html">Maria Winne</a> Vandenbergh. 

<p>In December 1724, he married Maria Spoor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their first two children were christened in Albany. Subsequent babies were baptized at the Dutch church in New York City. Until 1757, he witnessed baptisms at both Reformed churches.

<p>In 1745, he was identified as the eldest son in the <a href="../../wills/willmawinne3008.html">will</a> of his mother. In 1761, he sold the land he inherited to Volckert A. Douw. The lot was on the west side of the road in both Albany and Rensselaerswyck.

<p>As his name is not found on contemporary Albany-based documents, perhaps he lived in New York! Adam Vandenbergh owned a house on Broadway in Manhattan in 1756.

<p>This Adam Vandenbergh died after August 1761.
