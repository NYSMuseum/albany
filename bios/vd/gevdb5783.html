<strong>Gerrit C. Vandenbergh</strong></a> was born in September 1703. He was the son of Albany-Rensselaerswyck residents <a href="covdb5644.html">Cornelis</a> and Maria Van Buren Vandenbergh. However, within a decade his father was dead and his mother re-married.</p>

<p>In July 1729, he married <a href="../vv/mgtvvechten2550.html">Margarita Van Vechten</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, nine children had been christened in Albany where he was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>His home was in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where he owned a house and two lots. He <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">served</a> as constable in 1719, firemaster, deputy clerk, assistant alderman (1738), third ward alderman (first in 1740), and finally was chosen city treasurer or chamberlain first in 1743. He earned his living as a <a href="../../census1756.html#73">wagonner</a> and was an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5783">mainstay</a> for many decades.

<p>In 1741, he was named a partner in the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga Patent</a>.

<p>After 1765, he may have re-located to Rensselaerswyck as his home was noted on the <a href="../../im/im1767.html">Bleecker map</a> of 1767 and his name no longer appeared on Albany rolls. He also may have been a partner in patenting frontier land.

<p>Gerrit C. Vandenbergh probably died sometime after February 1780 when he and his wife witnessed a baptism in their Albany church. Later, his will was filed in what became Rensselaer County.
