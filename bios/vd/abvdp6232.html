      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abraham Vanderpoel</strong></a> probably was born 
        during the 1680s. He was a younger son of <a href="mewvdp.html">Melgert</a> 
        Wynantse and his first wife <a href="../vp/arvplanck1104.html">Ariaantie 
        Verplanck</a> Vanderpoel. His mother was dead by 1692 when his father 
        remarried. He was raised in the large combined family of a tradesman/trader. 
        However, his father was dead by 1700 before Abraham had reached adulthood. 
      <p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=%22abraham+vandr+poel%22&source=bl&ots=SqeoUOwitg&sig=7uaQKyIIU-0km-VeVc4TDyCH7zs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9KjiUoD4N4XcoAT7w4HwAw&ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20vandr%20poel%22&f=false">1710</a>, he was one of those engaged by the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> to dig ditches and to set up the new stockade.

<p>In September 1710, he was identified as the son and heir of the deceased Melgert in a <a href="../../wills/willmewvdp.html">Mayor's Court action</a> regarding his father's will. It reiterated the testator's desire to divide his substantial estate among his six living children and their survivors.

<p>In January 1713, Abraham married Anna <a href="vdb.html">Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1729, seven children had been christened in Albany where the parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#6232">1715</a>, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>After the christening of his daughter in June 1729, the name of this Abraham Vanderpoel (and also that of his wife) appears regularly in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>                                                                                                                             records as baptism sponsors until at least 1748.

<p>By the 1740s, however, additional, same-named individuals are at risk in Albany County (when this subject would have been in his seventies). In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6232">1742</a>, an Abraham Vanderpoel was listed as a freeholder in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>At this point, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> still seeking defining information on his later life and passing. </p>
