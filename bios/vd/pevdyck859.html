<strong>Petrus Van Dyck</strong></a> was born in May 1760. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany physician <a href="hvdyck832.html">Henry Van Dyck</a> and  <a href="../d/mgtdouw2156.html">Margarita Douw</a>  Van Dyck. His mother's <a href="../d/vopdouw2234.html">brother</a> was the mayor of Albany during the 1760s. Petrus grew up in a landmark <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a> home as his father treated most of mainline Albany.

<p>In January 1776, he was identified as the only living child in the <a href="../../sources.html#en">will</a> filed by his father. While Dr. Van Dyck was persecuted as a  <a href="../../friends.html">Tory</a>, young Petrus <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the Revolutionary army as an enlisted man in the First Regiment of the New York Line.
 
<p>In 1779, he married Alida Barheit at the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> Dutch church. By 1794, eight children had been christened in Schenectady. However, into the 1780s, Petrus held a pew at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - which he had surrendered before 1794.


<p>In 1784, a <a href="../../ag.html">newspaper</a> advertisement called him a dealer in general goods opposite the southeast <a href="../../im/imecourt.html">corner</a> of the Dutch church. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#859">1788</a>, his holdings were taxed under the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household of his widowed mother. However, by <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his household was enumerated on the Schenectady census.


<p>After that, Petrus Van Dyck may have moved beyond our Albany-based <a href="../../cbr.html">records sweep</a>. We seek information on his later life and passing.</p>
