<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Van Deusen</strong></a> is said to have been born about 1632 and to have been the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Pietersen_van_Deusen">Abraham Pieterse</a> and Tryntje Melchoir whose descendants are today known as <a href="vdu.html">Van Deusen</a>. Her parents raised their family in New Amsterdam where Abraham Pieterse became a prominent burgher. Maria and some of her siblings would become residents of Beverwyck.

<p>By 1651, <a href="../../res/sp.html">M</a>aria had married <a href="../m/tjmingael6189.html">Thomas Janse Mingael</a>. The marriage produced several notable children before Thomas Janse died. 

<p>In 1663, under terms specified in a pre-nuptual agreement, widow Maria re-married. Her second husband was <a href="../w/evwendell2655.html">Evert Janse Wendell</a>, a recent widower with children. That marriage produced a number of additional children.

<p>This large combined Wendell family was <a href="../../census1679.html#2655">head</a>quartered in Albany from where Evert Janse laid the framework for what became an impressive family fortune. In <a href="../../census1697.html#096">1697</a>, Maria's State Street home still included a young man and two children and soon would be valued among the elite properties in the city.

<p>In 1703, these Wendells conveyed a piece of city property to son/stepson <a href="../w/thwendell2729.html">Thomas</a>. Evert Janse is said to have died in 1709. "Maritje & Tho Wendell" were listed on the first ward <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2729">assessment</a> in that year as well.
