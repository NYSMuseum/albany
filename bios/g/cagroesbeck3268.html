<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Groesbeck</b></a> was born in January 1705. She was the daughter of <a href="stgroesbeck3377.html">Stephanus</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3231.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Groesbeck. The eldest daughter of a prominent fur trader, Catharina grew up in a comfortable <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>  home.</p>


<p>In November 1722, she was not yet seventeen years old when she married <a href="../s/pischuyler1736.html">Pieter Schuyler, Jr.</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Over the next two decades, the marriage produced eleven children.</p>

<p>Like her father, Pieter Schuyler, Jr. was a frontier trader who frequently was absent from their <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home. These Schuylers also owned a <a href="../../im/im1767.html">farm north</a> of the city.</p>

<p>In 1753, she was named co-executor of her father's <a href="../../wills/willstgroesbeck.html">estate</a>. She was left land near <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a>, in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, a share of a house in  <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, two "negresses," and a part of the remainder of his considerable estate to be shared with her sister and two living brothers. In addition, her four living children were provided for.</p>

<p>Pieter Schuyler, Jr. died in 1753. Catharina Groesbeck Schuyler died at the end of December in 1758. </p>
