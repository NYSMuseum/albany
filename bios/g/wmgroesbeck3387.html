<P><a href="#sources"><strong>William Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in June 1753. He was the first son born to Albany shoemaker/tanner <a href="dagroesbeck3286.html">David Groesbeck</a> and his first wife, <a href="../v/cavedder6746.html">Catharina Vedder</a> Groesbeck. His mother died in 1754 - shortly after giving birth to his younger brother. His father later re-married. Young William probably learned the elements of the leather trade at his father's shop and  <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning pits</a>.
 
<p>In April 1771, his marriage to <a href="../vd/cavdu5511.html">Catharina Van Deusen</a> was announced from the pulpit of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. He was two months away from his eighteenth birthday. By 1784, six children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>, where he later served as the church clerk.

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence, he was in his early twenties and probably assisted his father in garnering supplies for the Revolutionary army. Later, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3387">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. He also was identified as a lieuenant in that regiment. In 1777, the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> appointed him chimney viewer for the second ward.



<p>These Groesbecks lived modestly in various locations along the course of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. In 1797, he was living in a church-owned building on Dock Street that was destroyed by a <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> that swept that part of the city. In 1800, his second ward house held only the aging couple and two girls. 

<p>William Groesbeck died in July 1802 at the age of forty-nine. His widow survived until 1821.
