<P>The <a href="#sources"><b>Gansevoort</b></a> family of early Albany traces its roots to <a href="hagansevoort4653.html">Harmen Harmanse</a> and <a href="../c/maconyn7699.html">Maria 
        Conyn</a> Gansevoort This <a href="../../beverwyck.html">B</a>everwyck 
        <a href="../../nnd.html">pat</a>riarch is said to have been a <a href="../ger.html">We</a>stphalian emigr&eacute. His marriage to a brewer's daughter placed the family in brewing for several generations.</p>

<p><a href="sgans.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/th/saragansevoortth.jpg" align=right width=50 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="limner portrait of Sara Gansevoort (1718-31)"></a>Their son, <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a>/businessman <a href="leegansevoort4656.html">Leendert Gansevoort</a>, established the family in the city as three sons became Albany householders including brewer <a href="jogansevoort4665.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="pegansevoort4670.html">Peter Gansevoort</a>, a prominent physician. Daughter <a href="sgans.html">Sara</a> was among a number of family members who were memorialized in paintings.</p>

<p>Eldest son <a href="hagansevoort4662.html">Harmen Gansevoort</a> led the family 
        from brewing to business and brought it to the top echelon of early Albany 
        society. <a name=sons></a>Harme's sons, <a href="leogans4666.html">Leonard</a> 
        and <a href="pegans.html">Peter Gansevoort</a>, became leaders in the 
        Revolutionary movement and in the establishment of the new state and nation.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, five Gansevoort named households 
        were listed on the city census. By <a href="../../census1800.html#91">1800</a>, 
        only <a href="../../census1800.html">two</a> Gansevoort-named households 
        appeared on the city census. 
      <p>The family plot on the east side of <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market 
        Street</a> encompassed the brewery and homes for more than a hundred years. 
        The <a href="../../im/im1770.html">dock</a> at the end of Maiden Lane 
        was known as "Gansevoort's wharf." In 1789, Leonard Gansevoort purchased 
        the estate called <a href="../../na/whitehall.html">Whitehall</a>. His 
        <a href="maggans4668.html">daughter</a> lived there for many years.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1815</a>, four Gansevoort residences 
        remained in the city!</p>
      <p>Today, the family is recalled locally in the name of Gansevoort Street 
        - the one-time southern <a href="../../citylimits.html">boundary</a> of 
        the city, in the town of Gansevoort in Saratoga County, and in the names 
        of numerous places in New York State.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-author=Alice%20P.%20Kenney&page=1&rh=n%3A283155%2Cp_27%3AAlice%20P.%20Kenney">remarkable</a> (my inadequate word for wonderful) <a href="http://jointarchives.org/collections/registers/hope/kenney.html">career</a> of Alice P. Kenney has brought this early Albany family to life and has shown us the intricate workings of their intimate family-based enterprises. Were the Gansevoorts typical of the family-based nature of early Albany community life? Comparable (a dream for sure!) family-focused works on the other <a href="../../familynames.html">families</a> would be a way to begin such an evaluation!
