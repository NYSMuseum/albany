<strong>Hendrick Gerritse</strong></a> was born in December 1709. He was the last child but only son born to the marriage of Albany mainstays <a href="elgerr6006.html">Elbert Gerritse</a> and his wife, <a href="../p/mapruyn3567.html">Maria Pruyn</a> Gerritsen. He grew up learning the <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor's</a>	craft from his grandfather and father.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1731">1731</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1739">1739</a>, he was named firemaster in the second ward.


<p>In June 1747, he was named as the only son and legal heir in the <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">will</a> of his father. He was scheduled to receive, among other things, his father's house and lot and another lot near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. In August of that year, he was identified as the cousin and heir of <a href="rygerr6011.html">Ryer Gerritse</a>. Hendrick's father died in 1750.

<p>In April 1736, Hendrik Gerritse married "Dirckje Symense" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their son Gerrit was christened that September. Beyond that, a number of subsequently christened individuals claimed "Hendrick Gerritse" as their father. However, genealogical resources have not connected them to this individual.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#292">1756</a>, he was identified as a tailor and Albany householder. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">Assessment rolls</a> from the 1760s, accorded his third ward properties modestly. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6007">1763</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>We seek information on his later years and passing.</p>
