<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Gansevoort</strong></a> was born in March 1766. She was the daughter of <a href="pegansevoort4670.html">Peter</a> and <a href="../t/geteyck4869.html">Gerritje Ten Eyck</a> Gansevoort. She grew up as a younger daughter in the large family of a traditional Albany physician. However, her mother died in 1782. He father survived until 1809 and sustained the family's landmark home on <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">North Market Street</a> which, by <a href="../../census1800.html#4670">1800</a>, counted three of his adult daughters as residents - perhaps including thirty-four-year-old Anna and her budding family.

<p>In December 1792, she had married <a href="../q/ninq.html">Nicholas N. Quackenbush</a> at the Reformed church at "the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boght_Corners,_New_York">Boght</a>." By 1807, the marriage had produced at least four children.

<p>Anna's husband was an attorney whose <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22quqckenbush+nicholas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22quackenbush%20nicholas%22&f=false">office</a> was farther <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> near the city line. 

<p>Anna Gansevoort Quackenbush lost her husband in 1823. She lived on in their home at 272 North Market Street for several years. In 1828, the Albany newspaper noted that "Ann, widow of Nicholas N. Quackenbush" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA177&lpg=PA177&dq=%22nicholas+n+quackenbush%22+widow&source=bl&ots=GuJc0nZDNK&sig=uy9nTUcl3Wa8YNkVok9FsEB2zfk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iFMUT-bHMcbh0QGt85GLAw&sqi=2&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20n%20quackenbush%22%20widow&f=false">died</a> on December 16. She had lived sixty-two years.</p>
