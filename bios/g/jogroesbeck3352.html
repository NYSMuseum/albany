<strong>Johannes Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in March 1703. He was the eldest son of Albany leaders <a href="stgroesbeck3377.html">Stephanus</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3231.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Groesbeck. He grew up in a large family in a wealthy merchant's home.

<p>Although he witnessed a number of baptisms at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>, neither his marriage nor subsequent christenings were recorded in the Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church</a> records. 

<p>In April 1741, Johannes and his five children were left bequests in the will of New York merchant Benjamin D'Harriette. In December, the will of his father-in-law, Thomas Bayeux of NewYork, identified Groesbeck as a person of trust but did not give the name of his wife - who probably was a member of the Bayeux family.

<p>In 1743, he was accorded a birthright, a farm north of the Mohawk, and substantial shares of the <a href="../../wills/willstgroesbeck.html">estate</a> of his father. That will was probated in September 1744.

<p>However, by that time, Johannes Groesbeck was living in New York where he is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have died in 1752.</p>
