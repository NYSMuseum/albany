<P>Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> era Albany resident and <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Colin Gibson</strong></a> probably was born prior to 1750. Perhaps he was the same-named tailor who came from Paisley (in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wlYTbQ_wFz8C&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=%22colin+gibson%22+paisley&source=bl&ots=X1GJd0izfh&sig=qYO8qwTire_-p26y3KrUsedXNVo&hl=en&ei=2sh3TOzHBcL_lgeKuqTsCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCgQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22colin%20gibson%22%20paisley&f=false">Scotland</a>) to New York with his wife Janet (age 23) in February 1774. That Colin Gibson was then twenty-five years old.

<p>A number of <a href="../../marriages.html">marriage</a> and family senarios are documented for Colin Gibson in Albany and its environs. This particular individual may have married three times. The first may have been to the <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish woman named Janet. However, in January 1778, the son of Colin Gibson and Ellen Story was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In October 1807, a seventy-year-old Colin Gibson <a href="http://genealinks.com/marriages3/records109.htm">married</a> eighteen-year-old Peggy Miller of Cambridge. One-time Albany resident <a href="../f/jefairchild8014.html">Jesse Fairchild</a> officiated that ceremony.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8176">1779</a>, his lot in the first ward was valued on the city assessment roll. In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#8176">1781</a>, he was among those newcomers who purchased the freedom of Albany. He was identified as a tailor.

<p>In June <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5vm7k0yfMesC&pg=PA443&lpg=PA443&dq=%22colin+gibson%22+tailor+albany&source=bl&ots=uIJ5lhyf2D&sig=18iws--DBYPYOQXmMVvZpTQwGs0&hl=en&ei=t-V3TOiaGoGClAeC3J21Cg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CA8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">1780</a>, he was identifed as an Albany city tailor when he posted a bond for good behavior with the <a href="../../cddc.html">Albany Commissioners</a>.

<p>Otherwise, we seek information on his wartime activities. After the war, he was among those accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8176">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8176">1788</a>, his house and property were listed on the tax list. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8176">1790</a>, his first ward houshold included a couple and two boys. After that, his name seems to have dropped from Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">rolls</a>. 

<p>Colin Gibson is <a href="http://www.dcnyhistory.org/books/breview2.html">said</a> to have been one of the early settlers of Washington County and to have died there at a "good old age." Also, that same family-based <a href="../../res/ts.html">source</a> stated that he came from Scotland as a young man, was a United Presbyterian, and was married three times. We leave this sketch having raised a number of <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>.</p>
