<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elbert Gerritse</b></a> was born about 1670. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="gerygerr6020.html">Gerrit Ryerse</a> and <a href="../j/anjans6472.html">Anna Jans</a> Ryerse. Coming of age at the close of the seventeenth century, he took the <a href="../../res/sp.html">sur</a>name "<a href="gerritse.html">Gerritse</a>."</p>

<p>In 1694, he was identified as the eldest son and left a mandated bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willgerygerr.html">will</a> filed by his father. He also was made the guardian of his younger brothers and sisters. In 1713, he became the administrator of the family estate with the death of his mother.</p>

<p>In 1693, Elbert married tailor's daughter <a href="../p/mapruyn3567.html">Maria Pruyn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their five children were baptized there between 1694 and 1707. With his wife, he was a church member and frequent baptism sponsor. He also was a deacon and, in 1706, served as "churchmaster."</p>

<p>Living first with Maria's <a href="../../census1697.html#109">family</a>, he probably learned the <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a>'s trade from his father-in-law, <a href="../p/frpruyn.html">Frans Pruyn</a>. As late as 1747, he still thought of himself as a tailor.</p>

      <p>For a time, he continued to <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6006">live</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where he prospered in family businesses. Following his father into community service, Elbert served as constable, <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, assessor, <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militiaman</a> in <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#6006">1715</a>, and juror during the first decade of his adulthood.
<p>By <a href="../../org/cc.html#1718">1718</a>, he had relocated and was elected assistant alderman for the third ward. By that time, he had succeeded his father in business and had become a third ward <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6006">mainstay</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6006">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of third ward freeholders. He also owned lots along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.</p> 
   
<p>In June 1747, he filed a <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">will</a>. His children and grandchildren were named as heirs as Maria Pruyn Gerritse had died in 1713. Elbert Gerritse died in November 1750 and was buried <a href="../../dead.html">ben</a>eath the Albany church.</p>
