<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>John Graham</strong></a> (the elder) is <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/daughters-of-the-american-revolution-cn/lineage-book-volume-51-gua/page-2-lineage-book-volume-51-gua.shtml">said</a> to have been born at Morrisania, Westchester County in 1756. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and road to Albany.

<p>A number of John Grahams were living in New York and its environs during the era of the American Revolution. The future early Albany resident was an <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OV3XbgG9vbEC&pg=PA399&lpg=PA399&dq=%22graham+john%22+major&source=web&ots=9LXQn1AL1N&sig=J-2HNRRHmvu6RvYO7CraEd9HsxM#v=onepage&q=%22graham%20john%22%20major&f=false">officer</a> in the Revolutionary army - reaching the rank of Major in the "<a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_1st_reg.htm">Albany Regiment</a>" of the New York Line. He is <a href="http://usgwarchives.net/pa/1pa/1picts/sullivan/sullivanmisc2.html">said</a> to have participated in the expedition against the Iroquois in 1779.

<p>From the beginning of the war, Captain and then Major John Graham seems to have been on duty in the vicinity of Albany and serving the needs of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-mx2AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=%22john+graham%22&source=bl&ots=yvPlwumwIr&sig=54DpXYkXy0QpiDNl3Z6fI36taFc&hl=en&ei=96QGTeb_OYLGlQf_ttmACA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&q=%22john%20graham%22&f=false">then</a> the <a href="../../cddc.html">Comm</a>issioners for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies.

<p>In November 1778, at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> he married  <a href="../s/destaats4583.html">Debora Staats</a>, the <a href="../s/gestaats4569.html">daughter</a> of a prominent businessman and landholder. Beginning in 1780, the marriage began to produce children.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8219">1779</a>, his personal property was valued under the second ward house of Jochem Staats. A decade later, his house and lot received a separate <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8219">assessment</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8219">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for the third ward.

<p>After that, he appears to have left Albany. Perhaps they re-located to Schuylerville.

<p>Major John Graham is said to have died in Schuyler, Herkimer County on May 7, 1832. Perhaps he was the John Graham who is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TL_B6qhEPlMC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22john+graham%22+staats&source=bl&ots=Y_02KuLRan&sig=juDWFYT6W1kZD--4VMDoysISt5M&hl=en&ei=aYsHTbT4HMOqlAft8vntDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22john%20graham%22%20staats&f=false">buried</a> in the family cemetery on Staats Island.</p>
