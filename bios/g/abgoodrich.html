<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Abigail Goodrich Boardman</strong></a> was the wife of the newcomer builder <a href="../b/joboardman7364.html">John Boardman</a>. Like her future husband, she was a native of Wethersfield, Connecticut. A family-based <a href="https://archive.org/stream/goodrichfamilyin00good#page/76/mode/2up">resource</a> lists her birth date as April 4, 1762 and that she was first daughter born to the marriage of Elizur and Abigail Deming Goodrich. <a href="../qqqq.html">If so</a>, she would have been about thirty at the time of her marriage. 

<p>In any event, Abigail married Boardman in Wethersfield in January 1794. Shortly thereafter, these Boardmans relocated to Albany where John began a career first as a carpenter. He then was known as a builder.

<p>Their marriage produced at least nine children - mostly born after 1800. These Boardmans raised their family in a house located at <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22boardman+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22boardman%20john%22&f=false">93 State Street</a>. In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22goodrich+benezer%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22goodrich%20benezer%22&f=false">1813</a>, a Goodrich family member and others also shared that building. They were members of the First then Second <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> churches where John was an officer.

<p>According to printed "Inscriptions in the Second Presbyterian Burial Ground," Abigail Goodrich Boardman is <a href="https://archive.org/stream/annalsalbany03munsgoog#page/n112/mode/2up">said</a> to have died in April 1843 at the age of 70 years and three months. Thus, 
        she would have been born in a more plausible 1773. John Boardman passed 
        on in April 1853.</p>
