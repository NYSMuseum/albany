<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jan Gerritse</b></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Johannes) was born during the 1670s. He was the second son of <a href="gerygerr6020.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../j/anjans6472.html">Anna Jans</a> Ryerse. He was known by the patronymic "Gerritse."</p>

      <p>In 1694, he was identified as a shoemaker who had a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tan pit</a> on the south side 
        of the "little creek." He <a href="../../wills/willgerygerr.html">inherited</a> that property from his father. He 
        later held an additional lot in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 
        The <a href="../../census1697.html#170">census of 1697</a> placed him 
        alone in a third ward house next to that of his widowed mother.</p>


<p>He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> which sanctioned his marriage to tailor's daughter <a href="../p/chpruyn3527.html">Christina Pruyn</a> in 1706. She died after only one son. Then in his forties, by 1713, he had married widow <a href="../w/mawinne3008.html">Maria Winne</a> Vandenbergh. By 1722, she had given birth to three Gerritse children.</p>

<p>He served as an assessor for the first ward in 1702 and 1703. In 1715, he was 
        identified as a private in John Mingael's <a href="../../lists/list1715jmc.html">company</a> of the Albany County 
        <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. Five years later, he was 
        listed on a <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6008">freeholder's list</a>.</p>

<p>Jan Gerritse died in November 1725 and was buried beneath the church. His widow was still living in 1745.</p>
