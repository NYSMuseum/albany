<strong>Anna Gerrits</strong></a> was born in May 1693. She was the first child born to the marriage of <a href="elgerr6006.html">Elbert Gerritse</a> and <a href="../p/mapruyn3567.html">Maria Pruyn</a>. Anna grew up in a small family - first in the <a href="../../census1697.html#109">home</a> of Anna's grandfather - who taught her father the tailor's trade and lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Her mother died in 1731. Elbert became an Albany mainstay who divided his holdings among three living children in the <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">will</a> he filed in 1747. 

<p>Calling her "my beloved daughter," Elbert conveyed a major portion of his property to the still apparently unmarried Anna. Her father died in 1750 and Anna Gerrits was left with a number of parcels of land within the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a> - mostly near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. She also was permitted to live in his dwelling house in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> for two years after her father's death. However, title to that property was bequeathed to her younger brother <a href="hegerr6007.html">Hendrick</a>.

<p>Invested with substantial real property assets but closed out of any decision making by the will of her father, perhaps the unmarried Anna Gerrits lived under her brother's household.

<p>We seek information on her passing.</p>
