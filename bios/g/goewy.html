<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=mPlSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=goewy&source=bl&ots=3-TXmpjiiw&sig=vrYJM1gRfww1jUYplLpiYHCDq0Y&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD9Njvm5_SAhWKjFQKHRqkBtAQ6AEISzAG#v=onepage&q=goewy&f=false">var</a>iously (<a href="../../res/sp.html">esp.</a> Goewey), the story of the <a href="#sources"> <strong>Goewy family</strong></a> in America most likely begins with the emigration of one <a href="soabgoewy.html">Solomon Abelse</a> - who spent some time in Albany . His son, the long-lived <a href="jasgoewy5158.html">Jan Salomonse</a>, probably came to America after 1664 and was raising a family in Albany during the 1680s.

<p>The Albany Goewy family <a href="#sources">appears</a> to have been of <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> background. But we do seek defining information Jan Salomonse's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. The <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/genealogy/GOES">Goes family</a> (more on the east side of the Hudson) including <a  href="dijagoes.html">Dirck Janse Goes</a>  does not seem to be  closely connected.

<p>Jan Salomonse's son known as <a href="salgoewy5173.html">Salomon Goewy</a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">aka</a> Solomon) married at least twice and raised a large family in Albany and its environs.

<p>A number of contemporary family members were <a href="../../res/sp.html">named</a> John/Jan/Johannes 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, a list of Albany freeholders included the names of the abovementioned Solomon and one John "Goewys." However, none of the city householders identified in 1756 appeared under the name Goewy.

      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a>, a <a href="../../albanycounty.html">countywide</a>"Book 
        of the Freeholders" listed only <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Johannes 
        Goewy in close proximity to mainline city residents. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">Survey 
        resources</a> covering the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">upriver region 
        during the 1760s</a> reference the city properties of "Barent Goewyck" 
        and the "house of Jno Goewys." However, the comprehensive index notes 
        the holdings and activities of a number of regional personages as well 
        as an even more extensive listing under the surname of "Goes." 
      <p><a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">1779</a> the house and property of Gerrit Goewy appeared on the first ward assessment roll. A decade later in  <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>, the same property was valued as well.

<p>After the War, the name of John Goewy appeared on a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">list</a> of those eligible for a service related bounty right in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#3881">1790</a>, the household of Garret Gowey 
        was configured on the first ward census. Three more Goewy-named households 
        in surrounding Watervliet, but only one additional Goewy-named household 
        was enumerated for the entire State. 
      <p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22goewey%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22goewey%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed <a href="joagoewy.html">John A. Goewey</a> as a saddler at 14 Market Street.

<p>For much of the colonial period, the Goewy family maintained a small but consistent presence in the city. It was more prominent in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">surrounding area</a> and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Sources: Our overall comprehension of the Goewy experience relies on <i>The Goewy Family: The First Nine Generations</i> by Elaine Simms Goewey Koeler (Arlington Heights, Illinois, 1989). A  spiralbound compilation of 37 pages that includes an index was <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22the+goewey+family%22">located</a> on the <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a> and purchased via <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Goewey-family-first-nine-generations/dp/B0006EX3D6">Amazon.com</a> in 2015. Valuable for a generational profile of the family.
