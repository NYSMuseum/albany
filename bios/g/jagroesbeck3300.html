<strong>Jacob Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in Holland in February 1649. He was the first son born to the marriage of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="cljgroesbeck3369.html">Claes</a> and <a href="../s/elstevens.html">Elizabeth Stevens</a> Groesbeck. He came to America with his parents who were living in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> by 1660. His father was a fur trader and raised his family in a house on what became <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>By September 1674, he had removed to New York City where he married Anna Jacobs <a href="http://kinnexions.com/smlawson/vandergrift.htm">Vandergrift</a> - the daughter of a prominent businessman and official. The marriage produced several children who probably were christened in New York.
