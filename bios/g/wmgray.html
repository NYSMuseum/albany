<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>William Gray</strong></a> probably was born in England where we are told his mother and sister resided in 1787.

<p>Perhaps he did not marry as family information has not been found in the records of Albany <a href="../../churches.html">ch</a>urches nor in the larger <a href="../../cbr.html">com</a>munity-based archive.

<p>In <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/calendarofhistor01newy#page/646/mode/2up">1777</a>, he was among the Albany County freeholders who signed a petition directed to the governor calling for the return of exiled prisoners who were Albany residents.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8260">1779</a>, his personal property was valued under a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> business district.

<p>Perhaps this "William Gray" was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&pg=PA620&lpg=PA620&dq=%22william+gray%22+albany&source=bl&ots=_rOhUTzACc&sig=YamdhNTIfVc1hawroRMFJiI0Ga8&hl=en&ei=orcsTMw4hZ2WB5K3vYUK&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22william%20gray%22%20albany&f=false">identified</a> as a "dry goods merchant" located "near the city hotel." However, the reference may have been to a later time period.

<p>In January 1787, he was identified as a merchant when he was granted letters of administration on the estate of a friend.

<p>William Gray filed a <a href="../../sources.html#en">will</a> in Albany in April 1787. No wife nor children were identified. His mother in England and his sister Isabel were named as heirs. Gray was dead by August 24, 1787 when his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate.

<p>A number of other same-named contemporaries were prominent in other states. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> defining information on his origins and later life.</p>
