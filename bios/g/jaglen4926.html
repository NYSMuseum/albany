<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Jacob Glen</strong></a> was born about 1640. He was the son of Sander Leenderts and Cathalina Donchasen. This Scottish background family would become known by the surname "<a href="glen.html">Glen</a>."
   
      <p>By the 1660s, he had married fur trader's daughter <a href="../w/cawitbeck1708.html">Catharina 
        Witbeck</a>. The marriage produced at least five children. The Glens were 
        members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
      <p>Jacob Sanderse was a <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> who made his home on the South side of upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. In <a href="../../census1679.html#4926">1679</a>, his home was included on a census of Albany householders. Two years later, he signed a <a href="../../lists/list1681.html#4926">petition</a> asking the court to regulate the prices of furs.  He was an active trader on the Albany real estate market. He owned land in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> as well.
 
<p>Sick and bedridden but sound of mind, Jacob Sanderse Glen filed his <a href="../../wills/willjaglen4926.html">will</a> in August 1685. Still in his forties, he died in October and his widow  re-married.
