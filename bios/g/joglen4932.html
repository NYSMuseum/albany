      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Glen, Jr.</b></a> was born during the mid-1670s. 
        He was the son of <a href="jaglen4926.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../w/cawitbeck1708.html">Catharina 
        Witbeck</a> Glen. He was referred to as "Johannes Jacobse" or "John Glen, 
        Jr." to prevent confusion with his more prominent cousin, John Sanderse 
        Glen. His father was dead by the time John Jr. had reached his tenth birthday. 
        His mother re-married in 1696 as John Jr. reached adulthood.</p>


<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#146">1697</a>, he was living alone in his father's Albany house and was identified as head of the household. That home on Pearl Street sat between the houses of his future father and brother-in-law. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4932">1699</a>, "Johannes Jacobsen Glen" joined with his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England.</p>

<p>December 1698, he married a slightly older <a href="../b/janbleecker197.html">Jannetje Bleecker</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The fourth of their children was born early in 1706.</p>


<p>John Glen, Jr. filed a will in September 1706. It named his wife and three children to inherit his estate. He died shortly thereafter. His widow survived for another fifty years!</p>
