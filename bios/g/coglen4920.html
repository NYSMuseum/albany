<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Glen</strong></a> was born in 1741. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jaglen4927.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../c/elcuyler400.html">Elizabeth Cuyler</a> Glen. Following the death of his father in 1746, he learned about trade and commerce from his extended families in comfortable Albany-area settings.
 
<p>In October 1764, he married <a href="../n/elnicoll1697.html">Elizabeth Nicoll</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and pewholder. However, no children were christened at the Albany church and his marriage seems to have been childless.

<p>The couple lived first in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> and then on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. He was a merchant, investor, and real estate trader. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4920">1790</a>, his Albany home was served by six slaves.

<p>Glen's business interests seem to have been diverse. He was involved in real estate and with the Albany government. His enterprises brought him into conflict with the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">revolutionaries</a> during the late 1770s. During the early days of the conflict he had lent supplies and materials to the cause. In May 1778, he signed a community-based <a href="../../doc/petbenrogers.html">petition</a> for the release of a young horse thief. But, by July, his refusal to take the oath of allegiance caused his arrest and threatened banishment to the British lines. However, he later took the oath and did receive a land <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> for <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4920">service</a> in conjunction with the city regiment of the Albany County militia. In 1792, he was elected one of the first directors of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>.

<p>Before 1800, Cornelis Glen relocated to family property <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">south</a> of Albany where he <a href="#died">died</a> in March 1810. He was in his sixty-ninth year. He was buried in the family's Bethlehem plot. His will passed probate in May.
