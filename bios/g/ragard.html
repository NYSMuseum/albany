<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rachel Gardinier</strong></a> was born about 1750. She <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/v/a/n/Dale-Van-alstine/GENE1-0016.html#CHILD525826">probably was</a> an older daughter in the large family of Andries and Catharina De Garmo Gardinier. She was one of six children named in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wd-LTleLtO8C&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=%22Gardinier,+andries%22&source=bl&ots=MclGYLbI-1&sig=QSM8eWVAFd31d_GC-JR65HtlFPw&hl=en&ei=werFS6KHH4GB8gbxr8mhDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CBoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22Gardinier%2C%20andries%22&f=false">will</a> filed by her father in September 1768. At that time he was of the "Mohawk River." Her mother was not named in the will and her father died less that two weeks afterwards.

<p>Rachel married <a href="../m/samorr8246.html">Samuel Morrell</a> in March 1772 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1791, nine children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Morrells raised their family in or near Albany. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8246">1790</a>, Samuel's household was configured on the census for <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>Rachel lost her husband in February 1795 and she had him buried from the Dutch church. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a> home of the "widow of Saml Morrel" was valued on the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#rag">1800</a>, her name was at the head of a third ward Albany household that also included two boys and a young man. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22morrel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22morrel%22&f=false">1813</a>, the home of Widow Rachel at 38 Van Schaick Street and those of two sons appeared on the city directory. After another directory listing in 1814, the name of Rachel Gardinier Morrell dropped from the city record.</p>
