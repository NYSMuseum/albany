<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Robert Gray</strong></a> is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in New Jersey in September <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/marcius-denison-raymond/gray-genealogy--being-a-genealogical-record-and-history-of-the-descendants-of-j-mya/page-24-gray-genealogy--being-a-genealogical-record-and-history-of-the-descendants-of-j-mya.shtml">1745</a>.

<p>He also is said to have been one of five brothers from Essex County, New Jersey who <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/marcius-denison-raymond/gray-genealogy--being-a-genealogical-record-and-history-of-the-descendants-of-j-mya/page-24-gray-genealogy--being-a-genealogical-record-and-history-of-the-descendants-of-j-mya.shtml">served</a> in the Revolutionary army and settled elsewhere afterwards. A number of same-named contemporaries beyond the American <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gray_(sea_captain)">sea</a> captain are <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=C3gZAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=%22robert+gray%22+pension&source=bl&ots=ZdjxRF78P3&sig=ZinKMRKsbxbNPq6XTSv8-A6pe9s&hl=en&ei=E36DTLufAoSClAfsvJGrDw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CDkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20gray%22%20pension&f=false">at risk</a> and we must <a href="../qqqq.html">exercise</a> caution in fleshing out his life.

<p>Service in the Revolutionary army brought Robert Gray to Albany. In May 1777, he married <a href="../l/sulg1462.html">Susanna La Grange</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Both partners were identified as single people "of this county." By 1800, the marriage had produced at least six children.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8258">1788</a>, his house and property were listed on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> assessment roll. The census in <a href="../../census1790.html#8258">1790</a> noted that his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">S</a>outhside household included eight members. As late as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward house and lot were valued on the city assessment roll. 

<p>By 1800, he had left Albany and was settled on what is today Settles Road in Guilderland. In 1809, he became the fourth <a href="http://historicnewspapers.guilpl.org/altamont-enterprise-1998-july-december/altamont-enterprise-1998-july-december%20-%200269.pdf">town</a> supervisor. 

<p>According to Episcopal <a href="../../dead.html">burial</a> records, Robert Gray died in February 1834 and was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TL_B6qhEPlMC&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=%22robert+gray%22+albany&source=bl&ots=Y_-3IxUY3l&sig=ViDjHnVCJeBq20VkhlC95Acn4sc&hl=en&ei=tcR7TJ2AJoKBlAeSxq3sCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBgQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20gray%22%20albany&f=false">buried</a> at the farm in a cemetery 200 feet from the house. This Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">War</a> veteran had lived eighty-eight years. His wife died at the end of the month. Robert Gray's <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> passed probate in April.</p>
