<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>David Gibson</strong></a> probably was born during the 1740s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. 

<p>In March <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=%22david+gipson%22&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22david%20gipson%22&f=false">1765</a>, he leased land next to the holdings of Thomas Wilkerson from the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">C</a>orporation.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his third ward property was valued modestly. In October 1779, his name appeared on the assessment roll but no tax was specified. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8177">1788</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> holdings received modest assessments. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his lot in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">pastures</a> was taxed as a tenant of a <a href="../vr/vr.html">Van Rensselaer</a>. 

<p>His wife was Maria Egmont (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Eg</a>mond). One of their children was christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1777. He received some services there. Not until 1800, however, was Gibson counted among the members of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>.

<p>In November 1775, the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> paid his account for two pounds. On a number of occasions in 1776 and 1777, he was paid by the committee for riding express (delivering letters) to White Plains and around Albany County.

<p>In June <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/minutesalbanycou01newyrich#page/358/mode/2up">1779</a>, his wife, "Maritie," submitted a bill on behalf of Gibson "for riding an express" to the governor in Poughkeepsie. In November <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting02paltrich#page/586/mode/2up">1780</a>, he was brought before the <a href="../../cddc.html">Albany Commissioners</a> (on a warrant) for attempting to interfere with the apprehension of a suspect. He was examined and found to be loyal to the American cause. Gibson apologized and was discharged with a caution against like behavior in the future. Later, his accounts for 28 pounds and 5 pounds were ordered paid by the Commissioners. After the war, the name of "David A. Gibson" was included on the list of those who were accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8177">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1782">1782</a>, he first was named constable in the first ward. He served at least thru 1787 - being appointed high constable as well in 1784.

<p>Beginning in 1799, his name was included on the Albany <a href="../../poor.html#8177">poor rolls</A>. Some of the bequests thru 1802 were also for his family and his son.



<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#8177">1790</a>, his <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> household included eight members. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#8177">later</a>, the census counted three older women and a young man in addition to Gibson. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the census counted an aging couple and two young boys. That was the last reference to him in the community-based record encountered thus far.

  
<p>Several Gibsons (none named David or Mary) were listed in the first city directory in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22gibson&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22gibson&f=false">1813</a>. We seek defining information on the later life and passing of the one-time Albany resident named David Gibson. </p>
