<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in July 1731. He was the son of <a href="dagroesbeck3285.html">David</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdp6265.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a> Groesbeck. He grew up as part of a large family in the home of an Albany mainliner. 

<p>In July 1765, he married Aaltje Van Arnhem. She died after bearing four children. In September 1773, he re-married, this time to Catharina Van Schaick.  This second marriage produced ten children who were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a long-time member.
<p>Johannes Groesbeck was a shoemaker who lived on <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a> in Albany's second ward. For a time, he lived with his brother, <a href="dagroesbeck3286.html">David Groesbeck</a>. They owned or leased additional land in the <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> ravine. One of these lots had a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning</a> pit. In 1762, he was appointed constable in the second ward. The next year, he served as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. He also was a contractor of the city.

<p>He served in the colonial <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and later was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3355">land bounty right</a> for service to the Revolutionary cause in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>John D. Groesbeck was a Fox Street mainstay for more than fifty years. His household was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#3355">census</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#3355">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household included eight members. His holdings were included on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. He was listed in the first <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA68,M1">city directory</a> at 78 Fox Street.



<p>John D. Groesbeck died in December 1815 at the age of seventy-four.
