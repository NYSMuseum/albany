<P>Most family-based <a href="goewy.html#sources">resources</a> agree that <a href="#sources"><strong>Solomon Abelse Goewy</strong></a> (spelled <a href="../../res/sp.html">and</a> referred to variously) was the <a href="../../nnd.html">patriarch</a> of today's <a href="goewy.html">Goewy</a> family in America. He is said to have been of <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> ancestry. Perhaps he was christened at the "Old Church" in Amsterdam, Holland in May 1617. He is said to have been the fifth child born to the marriage of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Abelse Poppess - who appears to have married three times. 

<P>Thus, <a href="../../res/sp.html">Salomon</a> married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> "Barbara Philips" at the church in August 1638. At least their first six children were christened in Amsterdam between 1639 and about 1649. The most comprehensive <a href="goewy.html#sources">family-based resource</a> mentions two additional children without baptism particulars. Also, this individual may have been married previously.

<p>At this point, we seek <a href="../../res/origins.html">definitive</a> information on their emigration to New Netherland. Additionally, the story of his life in the upriver region of New Netherland/New York seems to rest on a single posthumous resource.

<p>Solomon Abelse Goewy was deceased in June/July 1668 when an <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA437#v=onepage&q&f=false">affidavit</a> filed by his heirs identified him as a native of Amsterdam and lately a carpenter (or a house carpenter's assistant) in Albany. This New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneer</a> had lived about fifty years.

<p>This sketchy <a href="../../res/bios.html#sketch">sketch</a> puts forth what we hope passes for his basic story.</p>
