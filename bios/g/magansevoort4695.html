<strong>Maria Gansevoot</strong></a> was born in February 1778. She was the first child born to the marriage of <a href="leogans4667.html">Leendert</a> (Leonard Jr.) and <a href="../vr/mavr5100.html">Maria Van Rensselaer</a>  Gansevoort. She grew up in a large family with homes in the <a href="../../census1790.html#4667">heart</a> of Albany and in the Van Rensselaer countryside. 

<p>In September 1796, she was only eighteen when she married her somewhat older neighbor <a href="../h/abhun4770.html">Abraham Hun</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage may have produced five children.

<p>These Huns made their home in the Hun family <a href="../../census1800.html#4781">home</a> on <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a> from where Abraham practiced law while the couple appeared ready to take their place in Albany society.

<p>However, Abraham Hun died of tuberculosis in January 1812. A year earlier, he had made Maria co-executor of his <a href="../../wills/willabhun4770.html">estate</a>. At that time, two of her children were still alive. In 1813, Maria was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA73&dq=%22hun+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22hun%20widow%22&f=false">listed</a> in the first city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a> as a widow living at 112 Market Street. 

<p>However, Maria Gansevoot Hun died in October 1813. She had succumbed to tuberculosis as well. Maria had lived a short twenty-five years. The two surviving Hun children were raised by her parents who moved into the Gansevoort house <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">located</a> next door.</p>
