<strong>Alida Gerritsen</strong></a> was born in May or June 1701. She was the daughter of <a href="elgerr6006.html">Elbert</a> and <a href="../p/mapruyn3567.html">Maria Pruyn</a> Gerritsen. She grew up in a tailor's  home as a member of a medium-sized, working class Albany family.

<p>In November 1727, she married <a href="isgrav8238.html">Isaac Graverat</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1745, eleven children had been christened in Albany whose names reflect family-based naming patterns. During that time, at least eight of her children were buried from the Dutch church. Two or <a href="elgrav8231.html">three</a> sons survived to lead notable lives. Alida Graverat was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor at her Albany church.

<p>These Graverats lived near the river in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> and held additional property along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> that she had <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">inherited</a> from her father in 1750.

<p>After Isaac's death in 1759 or '61, Alida Gerritsen Graverat became head of their household. In 1766 and 1767, she was listed on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> with her grown son <a href="hegrav8237.html">Hendrick</a>. By that time, her other son, <a href="gegrav8234.html">Gerrit</a>, had left Albany for the Great Lakes region.  In 1769, her pew at the church was transferred to Maria Pruyn.

<p>After that, her name has not been found in <a href="../../cbr.html">co</a>mmunity-based resources.</p>
