<strong>Johannes Groenendyck</strong></a> (sometimes Groendyck) probably was born in New York in March 1675. He was the son of Pieter and Marie de Lanoy (Delanoy) Groenendyck of New York.


<p>In September 1694, he married New York native <a href="../c/decuyler395.html">Delia Cuyler</a> in New York City where their first child was christened the following year. Another child was born in New York. But, between 1700 and 1703, three more children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Delia's parents already had relocated to Albany and perhaps these Groenendycks followed them. 

<p>In 1698, Johannes was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County. By that time he was living in Albany where he owned a substantial piece of property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He held the sheriff's office for only a year. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#8007">1699</a>, he joined other Albany people in signing a loyalty oath to the king of England.

<p>Within a decade, he relocated to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where he became a trader.

<p>Johannes Groenendyck died in December 1739 and was buried in Schenectady. According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, his widow carried on Groenendyck's business for many years.</p>
