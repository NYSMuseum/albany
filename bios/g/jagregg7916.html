      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Jane Gregg Edgar</b></a> was the wife of newcomer 
        merchant <a href="../e/daedgar7917.html">David Edgar</a>. According to 
        subsequent sources, she was born about 1723 and was of <a href="../irish.html">Scottish</a> 
        ancestry. 
      <p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/jagregg.jpg" width=200 align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Jane Gregg Edgar"></a>Married 
        at the Presbyterian church in Belfast in 1753, she accompanied her husband 
        to America where he became a frontier trader who mostly was based in Albany. 
        Their marriage produced several children and she later became an Albany 
        mainstay herself. 
      <p>David Edgar died in September 1776 leaving her trapped in <a href="../../or/or-bh.html">wartime</a> 
        Albany. Without Edgar's incomes, her family's fortune dwindled leaving 
        her "in misery and want." In August 1780, she <a href="../../sources.html#cp">applied</A> 
        to Governor George Clinton for permission to take her four children and 
        servants to Canada where her husband had owned property. Clinton was moved 
        to grant her petition. However, others who followed a harder line toward 
        the so-call "Tory wives" intervened and her permission to leave was withdrawn. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7916">1779</a>, her house and 
        holdings in the third ward were valued on the March and October assessment 
        rolls. It also appearded that a number of newcomer traders were her boarders.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7916">1788</a>, she was among 
        those whose personal holdings were assessed under the first ward. <a href="../../census1790.html#ge">Two 
        years later</a>, she was still in Albany and living in her son's second 
        ward home. 
      <p>Jane Gregg Edgar died in September 1800 at the age of seventy-seven. 
        "Jane, the wife of David Edgear" was buried in the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> 
        cemetery plot. She had lived in Albany for more than forty years.</p>
