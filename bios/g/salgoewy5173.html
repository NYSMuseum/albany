<P>Referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously (Solomon Goewey), Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Salomon Goewy</strong></a> was born in April 1687. He was the son of Albany newcomers <a href="jasgoewy5158.html">Jan Salomonse</a> and <a href="../l/caloock5933.html">Catharina Loockermans</a> Goewy. He was named for his grandfather, a pioneer settler of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>.

<p>This individual appears to have been married [at least] twice. In November or December of 1702, young "Salomon Goewy" of Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=05gyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA38&lpg=RA1-PA38&dq=%22salomon+goewy%22&source=bl&ots=1a_ZSZeEN4&sig=d-jUumD83WIb9XA76mOnqi6F1fs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bvGoUrnvAYWqkQfa3oAQ&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22salomon%20goewy%22&f=false">wed</a> "Catharina Dooren" at her Dutch church in New York City. The partners were identified as single people. At least one of their children was christened there. In November of 1726, "Alida, the wife of Salomon Goewy," was buried in the Albany churchyard. In June 1728, Salomon  married a then unnamed women (but later called Mary and/or Margaret) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Between 1714 and 1738, at least eleven more babies were christened at the Albany church where Salomon and his wives were regular baptism sponsors. In 1750, the <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a> of an Albany widow referenced "my daughter Alida, deceased, wife of Salomon Godway."

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#5173">1715</a>, Salomon's name appeared on the roster of an Albany militia company. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1717">1717</a>, he was appointed fireman for the first ward.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5158">1720</a>, only one name represented the family on a county-wide list of freeholders. <a href="../qqqq.html">P</a>erhaps this son was living under <a href="jasgoewy5158.html">Jan Solomonse</a>'s third ward roof. By <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5173">1742</a>, Salomon's name and probably a different Johannes Goewy appeared on the <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3">list</a> of Albany freeholders living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>In 1750, his name was referenced in the <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a> filed by his former mother-in-law in the context of him still being alive. 

<p>In 1756, his name does not seem to have appeared on the "<a href="../../guide/histres.html#cs">co</a>mprehensive" <a href="../../census1756.html">census</a> of Albany householders taken by the British army.  

<p>Dutch church records reveal that "Salomon Goewy" was buried from his church in October 1758.</p>
