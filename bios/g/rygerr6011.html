<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ryer Gerritse</b></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the youngest son of Albany trader <a href="gerygerr6020.html">Gerrit Ryerse</a> and his wife, <a href="../j/anjans6472.html">Anna Jans</a>. 

<p>In 1694, his father <a href="../../wills/willgerygerr.html">bequeathed</a> to him clothing, other personal items, and a share of his estate. By 1697, Gerritse Ryerse was dead and the Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#067">census</a> found Ryer living alone in a first ward house. At that time, his widowed mother <a href="../../census1697.html#169">lived</a> in another Albany home. Two years later, Ryer joined his neighbors in signing a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6011">loyalty oath</a> to the royal government. A decade later, his Albany holdings were assessed substantially on the city <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6011">tax roll</a>.</p>


<p>In April 1704, Ryer Gerritse married a somewhat younger <a href="../l/geerlansing3306.html">Geertruy Lansing</a> at her father's Albany house. Apparently, their long marriage was childless. However, both partners were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where they served as baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>This lifelong Albany resident was a prominent <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6011">involved</a> in many aspects of community life.       Constable, <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, assistant, and first ward alderman (1727-35), he was elected to the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> in 1726. During those years, he was an active member of the Albany <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. He lived near the south gate and owned other city property as well.</p> 


<p>In 1747, he wrote his <a href="../../wills/willrygerr6011.html">will</a>. Without other legal heirs, he left his real and personal property to his wife, Geertruy - and then to a number of Albany men. Ryer Gerritse died in October 1752. The will passed probate a month later</p>
