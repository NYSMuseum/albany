<strong>Catharina Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in May 1737. She was the daughter in the large family of <a href="dagroesbeck3285.html">David</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdp6265.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a> Groesbeck. She grew up in a carpenter's home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. According to her father's <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible19.htm">bible record</a>, another daughter with the <a href="../../res/sp.html">same</a> name was born in 1745 and died in 1766.

<p>In December 1762, Catharina married Albany native <a href="../p/capruyn3518.html">Casparus Pruyn</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1776, six children had been christened in Albany where she was an occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>This Pruyn family made its home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> where Casparus was a blacksmith. They were well-known Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#3518">residents</a> for several decades.


<p>Catharina Groesbeck Pruyn seems to have been accounted for in the census records of her husband's household thru 1810. However, one <a href="http://home.surewest.net/bcarl/2483.htm">authority</a> holds that she died in 1788 at the age of fifty.

<p>Casparus Pruyn died in October 1817. Their son was <a href="../../sources.html#ad">listed</a> as the householder on the city directory for 1818 and afterwards. We seek information on Cahtarina's later life and passing.</p>
