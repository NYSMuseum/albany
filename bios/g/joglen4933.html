<strong>Johannes Glen</strong></a> was born in February 1706. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="joglen4932.html">Johannes Glen, Jr.</a> and <a href="../b/janbleecker197.html">Jannetie Bleecker</a> Glen. His family was small due to the death of his father the same year of Johannes's birth. However, his mother survived for another fifty years.

<p>Johannes became an adult and continued to live with his mother. He appears to have not married but was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>Like many members of his family, this Johannes Glen was a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4933">merchant</a>, amassed a considerable fortune, and may have been the partner of members of the <a href="../b/bleecker.html">Bleecker</a> family. His second ward <a href="../../census1756.html#145">residence</a> was called a "good house" and his business career spanned five decades.

<p>Like other Albany-based <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a>, he may have spent considerable time in the Indian country. Perhaps he left a family behind when he returned home. In any event, by <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">1736</a>, he had settled permanently in Albany and was elected assistant alderman thru 1741. After serving for a year as firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1743">1743</a>, he was elected alderman for the second ward from <a href="../../org/cc.html#1748">1748</a> to 1753. 


<p>Johannes Glen filed a <a href="../../wills/willjoglen4933.html">will</a> in September 1767. It named his nieces and nephews as his heirs. He died in March 1770 at the age of sixty-five.</p>
