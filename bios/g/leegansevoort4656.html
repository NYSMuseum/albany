<P><a href="#sources"><b>Leendert Gansevoort</b></a> was born in September 1683. He was the only surviving son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="hagansevoort4653.html">Harme Harmanse</a> and <a href="../c/maconyn7699.html">Maria Conyn</a> Gansevoort.</p>


<p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/leengans.jpg" align=left vspace=4 hspace=4 boder=1 width=175 alt="Leendert Gansevoort- an Albany brewer"></a>In May 1712, he married Albany native <a href="../d/cadewandelaer6167.html">Catharina De Wandelaer</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1730, their eight children were baptized there and both parents served as <a href="#frequent">frequent</a> baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>Leendert followed his father in the <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewing</a> business. He also prospered to the point where he was elected alderman for the third ward from 1734 to 1739. His brewery behind the family property on the east side of <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a> was an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#267">landmark</a> for much of the eighteenth century. On a number of occasions, he delivered beer for the city <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a>.</p>

<p>This prosperous and politically active brewer was always counted among the city's <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4656">qualified voters</a>. His status was further documented and memorialized in a set of <a href="#portrait">portraits</a> done about 1720. No other Albany brewer was so favored!</p>

<p>In 1741, he was among the worthies favored with a share in the <a href="../../na/sacandaga.html">Sacandaga Patent</a>.
 
<p>Leendert Gansevoort filed a <a href="../../wills/willleengansevoort.html">will</a> in September 1762 - leaving an extensive estate to his wife during her widowhood and then to his two sons and the children of his sister. He died in December 1762 months short of his eightieth birthday. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4656">1763</a>, his name still appeared on an Albany freeholders list.  Leendert's will passed probate that August.</p>
