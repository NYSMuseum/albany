<P><a href="#sources"><strong>David Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in August 1728. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="dagroesbeck3285.html">David</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdp6265.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a> Groesbeck. He often was referred to as "David Groesbeck, Jr."

<p>In December 1752 he married <a href="../v/cavedder6746.html">Catharina Vedder</a>. She died following the birth of their second son in 1754. In 1765, he married <a href="../w/sawinne3116.html">Sarah Winne</a>. The two marriages produced only two children who were christened in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where this David Groesbeck was a member and deacon.
 
<p>He followed the trade of the <a href="../../census1756.html#32">shoemaker</a>. Sometimes, he was referred to as a cordwainer. His home and shop were in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> on property he shared with his younger brother, <a href="jogroesbeck3355.html">John</a>. They also leased a tanning pit on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. These Groesbecks were Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#3286">mainstays</a> for several decades. He probably was the "David Groesbeck" whose name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3286">1763</a>.

<p>In 1752, he was chosen constable for the second ward. He also belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. At the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> he threw his support to the Revolutionary cause. In 1778, he was named lieutenant of a company of <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">older Patriots</a> who would be called up only in an emergency. Later, he (along with his two sons) was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3286">Bounty Right</a> for service. 

<p>David Groesbeck, Jr. died in March 1795 at the age of sixty nine. His obituary characterized him as "a pious and exemplary man."
