<P>Two individuals named <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Guest</strong></a> lived in Albany during the 1790s. The younger <a href="joguest8288.html">John I. Guest</a> was an Albany mainstay until the early 1820s. This sketch organizes information on the life of the other John Guest who was a grocer and property owner during the 1790s.

<p>This John Guest may have been the brother of Albany resident <a href="heguest8287.html">Henry Guest</a>. Perhaps, like other residents surnamed Guest, he <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/talesofourforefa00mcpi/talesofourforefa00mcpi_djvu.txt">emigrated</a> from New Brunswick, New Jersey. Other provincial origins are possible as well. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In June 1756, John and Elizabeth Sellers Guest had their son Stephen christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. However, that information probably references an older Albany area couple.

<p>In 1798, the name of John Guest, a grocer, appeared on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">lists</a> of those eligible for jury duty before the Albany Mayor's Court.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and 2 storehouses in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> plus his modest personal property were valued on the city assessment rolls. After that, his name has not been encountered in our sweep of the community-based record. 

<p>With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the life of this John Guest we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
