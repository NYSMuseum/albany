<strong>Robert Gardinier</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> Gardner) was a <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> soldier living in Albany during the 1670s and 80s. At this point, we do not know whether he was married or had a family in Albany.

<p>In March 1677, he was called a soldier when he petitioned the Albany court to be appointed "carter and beer porter." His request was <a href="../../sources.html#cma">approved</a> and he was ordered to take the oath.

<p>In 1679, his lot was located next to that of Sgt. <a href="../p/wmparker8567.html">William Parker</a>. In that year, he was identified as a householder on the Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#8166">census</a>. In 1681, he was <a href="../../sources.html#era">involved</a> in a number of transactions regarding a house and lot on the hill in Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html#8166">1684</a>, his Albany taxes were in arrears.

<p>In January 1688, he resigned his commission as "beer carrier." That was the last reference to him in Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html">1689</a>, the name of Robert Gardinier or Gardner was not found on the assessment of Albany householders.</p>

The life of Robert Gardinier is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 8166. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. He may have been English or a New Englander or of New Netherland stock - but perhaps not related to the Gardiniers of the <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> area. For now, we know that he was a garrison soldier.
