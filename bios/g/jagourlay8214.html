<P><a href="#sources"><b>James Gourlay</b></a> was born in 1772. He was the son of <a href="../s/anschuyler1084.html">Anna Schuyler</a>. His baptism record identified merchant <a href="jagourlay8213.html">James Gourlay</a> as his father - a statement <a href="../../wills/willjagourlay.html">repudiated</a> by Gourlay a month later.</p>

<p>The elder James Gourlay was dead by the end of 1772 and the boy was raised by his mother under the umbrella of the <a href="../s/schuyler.html">Schuyler family</a>. However, Anna Schuyler remarried during the 1780s and raised another family.</p>

<p>James Gourlay's first wife was Hannah Ross who died in 1797 at the age of eighteen. In September 1799, he married Lana Bromley at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He buried his mother from the church in August 1798.</p>

<p>In 1797, he was living in a house on <a href="../../streets.html#dock">Dock Street</a> that was owned by <a href="../b/barbleecker150.html">Barent Bleecker</a> and was destroyed by <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a>. In 1800, his house appeared on the census for the town of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. Nominally a cordwainer, James Gourlay became a prominent Albany merchant. His home was on <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion</a> (later Washington Avenue) Street. City <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> sometimes listed him in partnership with Jeremiah Waterman at 85, 87, and 89 Washington! He was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. He served on Albany juries and was a justice of the peace. Later, he kept a boardinghouse at 89 Washington.  <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="more information readily available!"></a> </p>


<p>James Gourlay lost his wife, Helen, in October 1850. He filed a will in 1861. James Gourlay died in February 1862 in his ninety-first year!</p>
