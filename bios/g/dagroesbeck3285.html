<P><a href="#sources"><strong>David Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in March 1692. He was the son of Albany residents Willem G. and Geertruy Schuyler Groesbeck.

 
<p>In November 1724, David was thirty-two years old when he married a younger <a href="../vd/mavdp6265.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a>. By 1745, their twelve children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>This Groesbeck family set up their home facing a major Albany <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">intersection</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3285">1720</a>, he was identified as a freeholder in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He was a contractor and sometimes identified as a <a href="../../census1756.html#44">carpenter</a>. In 1715, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In 1720, he was named constable for the first ward. Two years later, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In 1732, he was elected assistant alderman - this time representing the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. He also was a contractor of the city of Albany and, in 1736, purchased a lot along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. In 1756, he was appointed as one of the assistant justices of the Albany County court of common pleas. 
 
<p>His wife passed in January 1757. David Groesbeck died in February 1763 and was buried from the Dutch church.
