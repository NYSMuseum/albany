<P>The <a href="#sources"><b>Glen family</b></a> is of Scottish origin. Many distinct branches have emigrated to North America since the 1600s. Its early Albany members are descended from Sander Leendertse [aka Alexander Lindsay] a servant and then settler at Fort Orange and <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. His son, <a href="jaglen4926.html">Jacob Sanderse Glen</a>, established the family permanently in Albany. However, the Glens became much more prominent in the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> area! The family was well represented by the marriages of its <a href="jaglen4929.html">daughters</a> to the Albany mainline.</p>


<p><a href="../../loc/glenhouse.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/bldg/chapelandsteuben.jpg" alt="Glen house - Chapel & Steuben Streets" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=1 width=100></a>In <a href="../../census1697.html">1697</a>, only the home of young <a href="joglen4932.html">John Glen, Jr.</a> was listed on the Albany census. His younger <a href="heglen4922.html">sister</a> married Albany silversmith <a href="../l/jalansing3477.html">Jacob G. Lansing</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, three Glen-named households were listed on the Albany census. land trader <a href="joglen4934.html">John Glen, Jr.</a> and his brother merchant <a href="heglen4923.html"> Henry Glen</a> were the most historically visible members of the Albany branch of the family during the era of the Revolution.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, two Glen-named households were listed on the Albany city census. In 1815, only one Glen-named household was listed in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.



<p>The development of family-owned property in Glenmont (located about a mile south of Cherry Hill) may have begun with the movement of merchant <a href="coglen4920.html">Cornelis Glen</a> there  following the American Revolution. The town of Glen in Montgomery County, Glenville in Schenectady,  the city of Glens Falls, and many other place names recall this pioneer family today.</p>
