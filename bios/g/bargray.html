<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barbara Gray</strong></a> is said to have been born about 1745 and would have been the daughter of John Gray of Cork, <a href="../irish.html">Ir</a>eland.

<p>In August 1767, she married thirty-two-year-old <a href="../s/cortschuyler1260.html">Cortlandt Schuyler</a>, an Albany native and, at that time, a British army officer on garrison duty in Ireland. Several (but perhaps only two) of their children were born in Ireland while the last two were christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peters</a> in Albany where these Schuylers were prominent members. The last two of their four children were christened in Albany in 1767 and 1769.

<p>Cortland Schuyler returned to America where he <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">leased</a> a large tract located south of the city. There, the retired officer and his <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a>-born wife sought to built a grand country seat where they would raise their growing family. The farm was located south of the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Normanskill</a> but was not shown on the <a href="../../im/im1767.html">map</a> of the manor made in 1767.

<p>However, that ambition and life were cut short in October 1773 when her husband was thrown from his horse while hunting on his property and died.

<p>During the early summer of 1774, she was <a href="../../art/lott.html#schuyler">visited</a> by a group of prominent New Yorkers en route to Albany on a sloop. At that time her new home was not quite finished but Abraham Lott noted that its riverside location was "very pleasent."

<p>According to family-based <a href="../../fhg.html#csg">resources</a>, widow Barbara and her children returned to Ireland in 1777. In 1784, her eldest son, <a href="../s/jocschuyler.html">John Courtland Schuyler</a>, was sent back to America to manage his father's New York estate. The <a href="../../wills/willjocschuyler.html">will</a> he filed in 1793 named his mother as executrix and heir. However, she had died by the time the will was probated in 1797.

<p>Barbara Gray Schuyler is said to have died in New York in 1794.</p>
