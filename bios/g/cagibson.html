<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catherine Gibson</strong></a> probably was born during the 1760s. She is said to have been the daughter of Albany resident <a href="dagibson.html">David Gibson</a>. Thus, she likely was born in Albany as those Gibsons were city residents at that time. However, we seek defining information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Catherine was the wife of Albany native <a href="../r/niradcliff1140.html">Nicholas Radcliff</a> and the mother of a number of children who were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a> at least during the 1790s.

<p>These Radcliffs made their <a href="../../census1800.html#1140">home</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> and were the long time <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=%22radcliff+nicholas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22radcliff%20nicholas%22&f=false">residents</a> of 6 Union Street.

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../census1800.html#1140">1800</a>, she and at least two young girls were enumerated in Gibson's first ward home. Catherine Gibson Radcliff last was accounted for on the household census in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>. Her husband was still the householder of <a href="../../sources.html#ad">record</a> in 1830.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on her later life and passing.</p>
