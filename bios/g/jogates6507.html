<P>According to family-based <a href="../../res/ts.html">res</a>ources,  
<a href="#sources">
<strong>John Gates</strong></a> was <a href="http://www.tracingourancestry.com/histories/gates/gatesfamiliesofamerica.pdf">born</a> on November 3, 1748. Several same-named contemporaries were born into New England families.

<p>Gates <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the Revolutionary army. He is said to have accompanied Benedict Arnold's expedition to Canada in 1775-76. He was an ensign in Col. James <a href="../l/jalivingston8605.html">L</a>ivingston's regiment from 1776 to 1780. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=heitman+gates&source=bl&ots=vjUBOn7ytb&sig=Jt9xL22FrWJm8EPlxqOYp3LTOOI&hl=en&ei=SZc3S6SZMIndlAe--cWZBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=&f=false">said</a> to have served as a private, sergeant, and officer   and to have retired from service on May 20, 1780. Afterwards, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6507">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia  regiment. In 1836, his widow applied for and was awarded an annual <a href="#sources">pension</a> of $240 plus five years in arrears for his service. In March 1781, Gates joined with <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a> in certifying that <a href="../w/hewaldron662.html">Hendrick Waldron</a> worked at the armory in Albany - probably meaning he had some firsthand knowledge of that service or that Hendrick was his brother-in-law.

<p>In March 1779, he married Albany native <a href="../vv/geervvranken8161.html">Geertruy Van Vranken</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1788, five children had been christened in Albany. Later, he was a member of the Dutch church consistory. 

<p>After first <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6507">lodging</a> in the third ward house of Geertie's parents, by <a href="../../census1790.html#gevvr">1790</a> their home was enumerated separately aloth next to that of Geertruy's parents. For several decades, their residence at 5 <a href="../../streets.html#tromp">Van Tromp Street</a> was an Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22john+gates%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22gates%20john%22&f=false">landmark</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6507">1800</a>, their household included eight family members - none of whom were old enough to have been Geertie's parents. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, John's house, lot, and workshop (all on Market Street) were valued on the third ward assessment roll.

<p>In 1791 and 1796, he was a fireman in a third ward fire company. Later, city directories noted he was a tax collector and a director of the Eastern Turnpike Company.

<p>In 1815, he purchased another lot on Van Tromp Street.  

<p>John Gates died in September 1825 and was buried from the Dutch church. An <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=XNU0AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA456&lpg=PA456&dq=%22john+gates%22+albany+collections+arnold&source=bl&ots=GwMavet-7i&sig=SB_oZDFkgo6kVUSK4YtzLtzwX8w&hl=en&ei=Ipg3S63VEY7JlAeg9uCoBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=&f=false"">obituary</a> summarized his service and stated that he had lived seventy-four years. Widow Geertruy received John's military service pension and carried on in their Van Tromp Street home until her death in 1839.</p>
