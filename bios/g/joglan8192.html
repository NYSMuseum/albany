      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes Glandorf</strong></a> was a schoolteacher in early eighteenth century Albany. He probably was not born to Albany area parents but came to the area as a young man.
      <p>In April 1721, he petitioned the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a> for permission to settle in Albany and to keep a school. His petition was granted and he was allowed a free house for seven years provided that he keep ". . . a good and commendable school as becomes a diligent schoolmaster." In July, he requested a larger building for the school. Subsequently, the Albany council rented Robert Van Deusen's house for ten pounds.

<p>In September 1729, he married <a href="../vc/mavcurler3969.html">Maria Van Corlaer</a>, the thrty-six-year-old daughter of an Albany businessman at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, church records do not provide baptism or sponsorship information on possible children!

<p>Johannes Glandorf was dead by November 1750 when his wife was called a widow in the will of her mother.</p>
