<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hendrick Graverat</b></a> was born in December 1737. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="isgrav8238.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="algerr6005.html">Alida Gerritsen</a> Graverat. He grew up a middle child <a href="../../wards.html#3">near</a> the Albany waterfront in a large family where most of his ten siblings did not survive childhood.</p>


<p>He was thirty-five-years-old when he married Maria Van Driessen in March 1773. The marriage produced at least one child - a daughter named <a href="algrav.html">Alida</a> who later produced a "mourning sampler" that provides vital information on her parents.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1764">1764</a>, he was made constable for the third ward. In 1773, he kept boarders in his modest home located on Market Street near Orange.  

<p>Although documentation of his wartime service has thus far eluded our search, he was awarded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8237">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany County militia. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8237">1788</a>, his <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> home received a modest assessment. His third ward household was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#8237">1790</a>. </p>

<p>Hendrick Graverat lost his wife in February 1797, Following her death, perhaps he resided with another family member. He died on August 15, 1802 at the age of sixty-four. Probably <a href="http://www.goantiques.com/detail,needlework-memorial-oil,816454.html">created</a> by his daughter, Alida Graverat Dunbar (a girl is shown grieving), this beautiful piece of "mourning art" commemorates the passing of Hendrick and his wife. His <a href="../d/rodunbar2271.html">son-in-law</a> paid for the pall and hearse for his funeral.</p>
