      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Elbert Graverat</strong></a> was born in 
        November 1736. He was the son of <a href="isgrav8238.html">Isaac</a> and 
        <a href="algerr6005.html">Alida Gerritsen</a> Graverat. This middle child 
        of a very <a href="#large">large</a> Albany family grew up in a <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North</a> 
        end home located near the waterfront. 
      <p>In 1747, he was left a city lot in the <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">will</a> 
        of his maternal grandfather. That property was located south of where 
        <a href="elgerr6006.html">Elbert Gerritse</a> then lived. The will passed 
        probate in 1750. 
      <p>Unlike most of his family, this Elbert Graverat does not appear to have 
        married or to have been a visible member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>However, his <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#8231">name</a> was 
        included on a list of Albany freeholders from 1763. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#8231">1767</a>, his name was 
        on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company. 
      <p>In March 1768, Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">council</a> 
        minutes noted that the street on which his house was located (running 
        to Watervliet off of Pearl) was to be called "Amelia Street." 
      <p>The name of Elbert Graverat has not been encountered in the <a href="../../cbr.html">community 
        based record</a> after the 1760s. We seek information on his passing.</p>

          children presented for baptism. However, at least eight of them died 
          during childhood.</p>
