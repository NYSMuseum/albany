<P>Two individuals named "John Guest" lived in Albany during the late 1790s and afterwards. This sketch strives to organize biographical infomation on the younger historical character whose <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household was configured on the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#8288">1800</a>. Perhaps, this individual was <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=casey123&id=I2189">born and married</a> in Middlesex, New Jersey.

<p>Both John Guests appear to have been married and raising families in Albany. This individual (John I. or J. or perhaps John Jr.) was married to "Sarah Williams" who <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&r=an&dbid=2226&iid=32229_420302988_0030-01075&fn=Sarah&ln=Guest&st=r&ssrc=&pid=371174">died</a> in March 1822 at the age of fifty-four and later was buried with the Methodist Episcopal members in Albany Rural Cemetery. He probably was a <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> - at least during the early 1800s. Their daughter was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html"> Dutch church</a> in February 1799.
. 

<p>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Guest</strong></a> was born between 1756 and 1774. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and personal property were valued modestly on the first ward assessment roll. At that time, <a href="joguest8289.html">another</a> John Guest had personal property and owned a house, lot, and two storehouses in the third ward. Only the first ward resident appeared on the censuses beginning in 1800 and in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> and 1820.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%22guest+john%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22guest%20john%22&f=false">1813</a>, "John I. Guest was identified as a turner who lived on <a href="../../streets.html#liberty">Liberty Street</a> and had a shop on Maiden Lane and then on South Market Street. Until 1822, the directory gave this turner's address as 570 South Market Street.

<p>After 1800, John Guest. Jr. was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html#members">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>John I. (or J.) Guest  was alive in March 1822 when his wife died. We seek information on his later life and passing.</p>
