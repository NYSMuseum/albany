<p><a href="../../res/sp.html">This</a> John Goewy was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA1-PA127&lpg=RA2-PA127#v=onepage&q&f=false">born</a> on April 22, 1772. He was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> a month later as the son of Andries and Florena (Glorena) Young Goewy. He most often was referred to as <a href="#sources">John A. Goewy</a>.

<p>In May 1796, his name appeared in the community-based record when he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">id</a>entified as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fire</a>man in "Division 1." 

<p>In August 1797, he married <a href="../d/radforeest5199.html">Rachel De Foreest</a> at the Albany church.  Their <a href="https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/john-goewey_48829838">son</a> was christened in Albany in 1798. The marriage produced additional children. 

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his shop in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> was valued modestly. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, both his Market Street shop and a vacant lot on <a href="../../streets.html#orange">Orange Street</a> were listed on the third ward assessment roll.  In November 1816, John A. and Rachel sold a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lot</a> in an unspecified location.

<p>Perhaps he was the "John Geweye" whose <a href="../../census1800.html#jogo">household</a> was configured on the census of 1800 in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>In July <a href="http://searches2.rootsweb.com/th/read/NYRENSSE/2010-04/1271686140">1804</a>, he was named co-executor of the will of his father-in-law, Philip De Foreest of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Sch</a>odack.

<p>He was listed as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">saddler</a> in the first Albany city directory in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22goewey%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22goewey%22&f=false">1813</a>. At that time and afterwards, his address was given as 14 Market and then as 209 North Market Streets - probably the same address near the evolving northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a>. 

 
<p>In <a href="../../wills/willjofondajr.html#joag">1814</a>, John A. Goewy was among those who witnessed the will of a <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> neighbor.
  

<p><a name=dead></a>He <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA152&lpg=PA152&dq=%22june+25,+1828%22+albany&source=bl&ots=SrdvUIqhuf&sig=8YO6m5dM6unsJxTWrDgGfpF3Y2A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPmp3uw5zSAhWpzIMKHSitAoEQ6AEIOjAG#v=onepage&q=%22june%2025%2C%201828%22%20albany&f=false">died</a> in June 1828 and was <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Dutch church plot. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> a month later. John A. Goewy was buried alongside his wife "Rachel DeForest" who had died eight years earlier. John A. Goewy had lived more that fifty-six years. Their final resting place has been listed as the <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.
