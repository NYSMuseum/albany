      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Gansevoort</b></a> was born in April 1721. 
        He was the middle son of <a href="leegansevoort4656.html">Leendert</a> 
        and <a href="../d/cadewandelaer6167.html">Catharina De Wandelaer</a> Gansevoort. 
        He grew up learning brewing and business at the family property facing 
        <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a> and along the Albany 
        <a href="../../loc/landscape.html">waterfront</a>.</p>
      <p>Johannes followed his father in the family <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewery</a>. 
        He made an important business connection in 1750 when he married <a href="../d/madouw2161.html">Maria 
        Douw</a>. The marriage produced only four children before her death in 
        1759. In 1764, he married Eva Beekman - the mother of two more Gansevoort 
        children. Although his children with Maria Douw were baptized in the Albany 
        Dutch church and he was married and witnessed baptisms there, later Johannes 
        may have been more comfortable at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> 
        Anglican church where his servant, Hendrick, received services in 1768.</p>
      <p>Johannes Gansevoort lived in the third ward and took over the brewery 
        with the <a href="../../wills/willleengansevoort.html">passing</a> of 
        Leendert Gansevoort in 1762. The next <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4665">year</a>, 
        his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. In 1764, he was identified 
        as an Albany merchant. A few years later, his property was assessed with 
        the most valuable Albany real estate. After serving as constable and firemaster, 
        he was elected assistant alderman in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a> in 1762 and '63. He also was paid in wheat for services to the 
        <a href="../../corporation.html">city government</a>.</p>
      <p>He stood with other Albany mainstays in opposition to the Stamp Act when 
        he signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#4665">constitution</a> of the 
        Albany Sons of Liberty in 1766. A decade later, he was in his mid-fifties 
        and appeared to not be involved in the crusade for American liberties 
        except to store the "goods and effects" of refugees from Orange County 
        in 1777.</p>
      <p>Johannes Gansevoort is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false">said</a> to have died in November 1781 at the age 
        of sixty!</p>
