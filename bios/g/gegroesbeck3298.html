<strong>Gerardus Groesbeck </strong></a> was born in October 1709. He was the youngest son of Albany leaders <a href="stgroesbeck3377.html">Stephanus</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3231.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Groesbeck. He grew up in a prominent  merchant's house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>He was twenty-nine in March 1739 when he married young <a href="../t/matbroeck70.html">Maria Ten Broeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Four months later, the first of their ten children was christened in the Albany church where he was a pewholder and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>They set up their home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in a "good house" Gerardus had <a href="../../wills/willstgroesbeck.html">inherited</a> from his father. Stephanus Groesbeck left this younger son substantial real estate and monetary resources. Like his father and father-in-law, Gerardus was a <a href="../../census1756.html#148">merchant</a> and was involved in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian trade</a>.  Although absent from earlier <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">listings</a>, in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3298">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders..

<p>Besides his Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">holdings</a>, Gerardus had lots in Rensselaerswyck and shares in patents beyond.

<p>Aside from occasional accounts with the city and being elected assistant alderman for the third ward in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1742">1742</a>, Gerardus remained a low profile, moderately successful merchant as his active life wound down in the third quarter of the eighteenth century.


<p>Gerardus Groesbeck died in September 1788 and was buried from his church. His will passed probate in December 1794. His widow lived on until 1805.</p>
