<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gregor Grant</strong></a> (aka George Grant) <a href="../../census1800.html#8223">prob</a>ably was born during the mid-eighteenth century. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lAUTAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=%22gregor+grant%22+albany&source=bl&ots=PiGSYVeLf8&sig=xFvbMz3O6lAmGCnxNQJTMX3ztPM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mzz4T_bRL8rq0gGGpPC5Bg&sqi=2&ved=0CEcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22gregor%20grant%22%20albany&f=false">Perhaps</a>, he emigrated from Abernathy, Scotland in 1774, joined the Revolutionary army, and settled in Albany.

<p>We seek information on his marital status. He seems to have fathered children. 

<p>He was in Albany at least by <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8223">1779</a> when his real property in the first ward near the <a href="../w/wendell.html">Wendell</a> pastures was assessed modestly. At that time, the lot and personal property of "George Grant" also were valued as two additional but separate items.

<p>In August <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA329&lpg=PA329&dq=grant's%22&source=bl&ots=jw5IXDs1jS&sig=mZqSMtkhL-RdlEgGo0hV0pBnv-k&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bwL3T46KOsa-0QHwqozKBg&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">1781</a>, his leased lot next to that of <a href="../c/alcamp7526.html">Alexander Campbell</a> was referenced in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a>. During the 1780s, he had some <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq=%22gregor+grant%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0TmhupPtAt&sig=Q7ygOtVoJA-uRffezmU_K_iYU-Q&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dDr4T7XJMOXX0QGUld3eBg&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22gregor%20grant%22%20albany&f=false">business</a> with the city government although he does not seem to have held public positions. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8223">1788</a> and in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot were assessed in the same location.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#8223">1790</a>, "George" Grant's household (in the same location) included five members. A decade later, "Gregor's" first ward <a href="../../census1800.html#8223">household</a> encompassed only a young man and the aging couple.

<p>In 1794, he appears to have been among those who owed a small sum to the <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html#8223">estate</a> of William Shepherd.

<p>In the winter of <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, he was listed on two lists of prospective jurors twice and was identified as a "<a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">yeoman</a>."
<p>Beyond those references, we have not yet encountered additional information on the life of Gregor Grant. With a number of outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> and little comprehension of the meaning of his names, we move on for now. </p>
