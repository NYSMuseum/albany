<P>The <a href="#sources"><b>Gerritse</b></a> family in Albany begins with Beverwyck pioneer <a href="ryegerr6010.html">Ryer Elbertse</a> and his wife Maria Barents, the widow of Gerrit Van Schaick. His son, <a href="gerygerr6020.html">Gerrit Ryerse</a>, became an Albany resident. <a href="../../res/sp.html">Spellings</a> of the name vary widely after the first three letters. </p>

<p>The sons of Gerrit Ryerse, shoemaker and tanner <a href="jagerr6008.html">Jan Gerritse</a>, trader <a href="rygerr6011.html">Ryer Gerritse</a>, and <a href="elgerr6006.html">Elbert Gerritse</a>, further established the Gerritse family in early Albany.</p>


<p><a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6008">Mainstays</a> for much of the first half of the eighteenth century, by <a href="#name">1750s</a> the Gerritse family name had disappeared from the city rolls as <a name=name></a>the <a href="../../census1756.html#292">census of 1756</a> listed only tailor "<a href="hegerr6007.html">Hend Garrison</a>" as an Albany householder. However, the name of "<a href="frgerr6019.html">Fredrick Garrison</a>" also appeared on that community survey.</p>

<p>The descendants of Ryer Elbertse are distinct from the family of <a href="../vb/mgvb6656.html">Marte Gerritse</a> (Van Bergen)!</p>
 
<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, only the name of <a href="../../bios/g/frgerr6019.html">Frederick Garrison</a> appeared on the Albany census. However, we suspect that his origins lie elsewhere. Statewide, the "Gerritsen" surname no longer was found among the heads of households.

<p>After 1700, the frequently encountered patronymic "Gerritse" characteristic of a number of early Albany families eventually was replaced by surnames such as "Lansing," "Van Schaick," "Vanderpoel," "Van Wie," and others. None of those people were descendants of the first Albany <a href="ryegerr6010.html">Ryer Elbertse</a> as noted above.

<p>The so-called "Gerritse" family seems to have ceased following the passing of <a href="hegerr6007.html">Hendrick Gerritse</a> - the seemingly sole surviving son of <a href="elgerr6006.html">Elbert Gerritse</a>.</p>
