      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Helena Glen</b></a> was born in January 1683. She was 
        the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jaglen4926.html">Jacob S</a>. 
        and <a href="../w/cawitbeck1708.html">Catharina Witbeck</a> Glen. She 
        grew up in her father's house on upper State Street. In 1685, she was 
        named in Jacob Sanderse's <a href="../../wills/willjaglen4926.html">will</a>, 
        left a third of his land at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Scotia</a>, 
        and identified as aged two years.</p>

<p>In October 1711, she married Albany silversmith <a href="../l/jalansing3477.html">Jacob G. Lansing</a>. Several years <a href="../../marriages.html">older</a> than the typical early Albany bride, she still bore nine children - the first of whom was born a few days before her wedding in 1711. The last two were twins who arrived in 1725 when she was forty-two-years-old.  The children were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>This Lansing family lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in what would become a landmark building of the second ward. Their closest neighbors included kinfolk from both the Lansing and Glen families.</p> 

<p>Helena Glen Lansing may have died following the birth of her twins in 1725. Her husband lived until 1767.</p>
