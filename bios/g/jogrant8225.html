<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Grant</strong></a> (aka the younger) probably was born during the mid-eighteenth century. This individual was an Albany resident possibly as early as the late 1770s, almost certainly in <a href="../../census1800.html#8225">1800</a>, and afterwards.

<p>He is distinct from an older <a href="jogrant.html">John Grant</a> and probably not the outlier <a href="http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/d/a/v/Roderic-A-Davis-2nd/GENE5-0003.html">John Grant</a> (1778-after 1825) who raised a family with Mary Cumming. This subject may have been born in America and may have been the son of the elder - or not! However, we are pretty certain that he was of <a href="../irish.html">Scottish</a> ancestry.

<p>Coming of age during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">era</a> of the American Revolution, we expect to find information on his wartime activities. Afterwards, this individual was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#8225">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>His wife was identified as "Janet Mc D." Later, he may have married for a second time.

<p>During the 1790s, John Grant was a prominent <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> where at least one child was christened in 1789. He was a founder and an officer of Albany's St. Andrews Society. In 1794, he subscribed to purchase a bible. In <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">1802</a>, he was among the first trustees of Albany's United Presbyterian Church.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, his name appeared on a number of jury lists where he was identified differently as a <a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">yeoman</a>, a gentleman, and then as a candlemaker and tallow chandler. He also was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8225">1779</a>, John Grant's lot (perhaps in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>) was assessed most modestly. A decade <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">later</a>,  the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8225">house</a> and lot and also the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8225s">store</a> and lot of John Grant were valued on the first ward assessment roll. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his first ward property in roughly the same location was listed on the city assessment roll.

<p>The first census, in <a href="../../census1790.html#8225">1790</a>, noted eight people living in his first ward home. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#8225">later</a>, the city census configured his household in roughly the same location with four young boys and six others including a slightly younger senior woman. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>, the census chronicled the aging of his family. After that, his name drops from the community-based record.

<p>Understanding that the Albany resident named John Grant still poses significant outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on for now!</p>
