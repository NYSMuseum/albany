<P>This <a href="#sources"><strong>Wouter Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in August 1714. He was the son of <a href="nigroesbeck3370.html">Nicholas</a> and <a href="../q/maq2206.html">Maria Quackenbush</a> Groesbeck. He sometimes was <a href="../../res/sp.html">called</a> "Walter N. Groesbeck" perhaps to prevent confusion with same-named contemporaries particularly with a slightly <a href="wogroesbeck.html">older</a> resident of <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Sch</a>aghticoke who had business with the Albany city council during the 1750s and 60s.

<p>In December 1739, he married shipwright's daughter <a href="../b/mabogardus.html">Maria Bogardus</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1750, five children had been christened in Albany. <a href="../qqqq.html">Perhaps</a> his first wife died and he remarried in 1761. Thus, the second marriage would have produced a number of children as well. However, we must back off of further family connections due to the existence of same-named contemporaries and an indistinct picture painted by <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources.

<p>At this point, we <a href="../../res/guess.html">believe</a> that this Wouter N. Groesbeck was an Albany resident.

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22wouter+groesbeck%22+%22great+Gun%22&source=bl&ots=wxiFgTAbiy&sig=ulHgV5F0KOnEv7rYdKSl6zOAVw8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qnWzUJvLOYeD0QHd84DIAQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22wouter%20groesbeck%22%20%22great%20Gun%22&f=false">1754</a>, we believe that this individual was among those paid by the city for "rideing a great Gun." Five years later, Wouter N. Groesbeck's account again was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA116&lpg=PA116&dq=%22groesbeck%22&source=bl&ots=wxiFgTAbiy&sig=ulHgV5F0KOnEv7rYdKSl6zOAVw8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=qnWzUJvLOYeD0QHd84DIAQ&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22groesbeck&f=false">paid</a> from the city treasury.


<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#103">1756</a>, "Mr. Walter Groosbank" was identified as a wheelmaker on a census of Albany householders compiled by the British army. His house appears to have been located next to that of his widowed <a href="../k/jaknick1070.html">mother-in-law</a>.
 
<p>By the mid-1760s, the name of Albany native Wouter N. Groesbeck no longer was found in the community-based record. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his later life and passing. </p>
