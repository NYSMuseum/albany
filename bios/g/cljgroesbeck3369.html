<P>From a number of <a href="../../res/ts.html">sources</a>, we are able to infer that <a href="#sources"><strong>Claes Jacobse</strong></a> was born in Europe about 1624, that he was from Rotterdam, perhaps was born in Breda, and that his father was named Jacob.

<p>In May 1648, he married <a href="../s/elstevens.html">Elizabeth Stevens</a> in Amsterdam, Holland. By 1659, they had emigrated to New Netherland and had taken up residence in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. His marriage produced at least the seven children who were still alive in 1707. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> as were other members of his family.

<p>In 1660, he was among the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a> who petitioned for <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#3369">more latitude</a> in trading with the Indians. Over the next half century, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home was regularly listed on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1679">census</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3369">assessment</a> rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3369">1699</a>, he joined with his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England.

<p>He also was known as a carpenter. His <a href="../../census1697.html#131">home</a> was on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> across from the house of his son, <a href="wmgroesbeck3381.html">Willem Claese</a>. He owned additional properties in Albany and beyond.

  
<p>Claes Jacobse Groesbeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willcljgroesbeck.html">will</a> in January 1707. It named his wife and seven children as his heirs. He died in March 1712. This <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneer</a> of New Netherland had lived almost ninety years.
