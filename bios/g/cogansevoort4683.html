<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Conrad Gansevoort</strong></a> was born in March 1761. He was the eldest son of <a href="pegansevoort4670.html">Pieter</a> and <a href="../t/geteyck4869.html">Gerritje Ten Eyck</a> Gansevoort. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home of a prominent physician. Family-based <a href="../../books.html#apkgans">resources</a> have noted that he was groomed to enter the <a href="../../trades/wood.html">lumber</a> business. 

<p>Just fourteen at the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">outbreak of hostilities</a> in 1775, he soon found himself a member of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. He rose through the ranks to <a href="https://www.fold3.com/image/10240889?ann=b68edd80-db45-11e4-2b02-467f4b0d6b65">sergeant</a>. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> more detailed information on his wartime activities.

<p>However, it appears that he remained close to home for a good portion of the wartime years. In May 1778, he was among those Albany people who signed a <a href="../../doc/petbenrogers.html">petition</a> asking for the release of a convicted horse thief. By <a href="http://www.omdhs.syracusemasons.com/sites/default/files/history/Craft%20Masonry%20in%20Albany%20County.pdf">1783</a>, he had joined an Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic</a> lodge.

<p>In May 1780, he was <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/Browse/view.aspx?dbid=2204&path=171.165&sid=&gskw=Conrad+Gansevoort">made</a> an ensign in the first regiment of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany County militia</a> and promoted to second lieutenant that June. Afterwards, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4683">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In October 1782, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtte.html">will</a> of his <a href="../t/anmgte4836.html">aunt</a>.

<p>With the end of the war, he took up <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4683">residence</a> in the Market Street home of his uncle <a href="pegans.html">Peter Gansevoort</a> to further prepare him for his own future business in the west.

<p>He is <a href="http://www.gdcooke.org/SS/default.aspx/page/org2-o/p408.htm">said</a> to have married <a href="../r/elroseboom.html">Elizabeth Roseboom</a> in December 1791. By 1810, the marriage had produced at least five children - none of whom seem to have been christened at Albany churches.

<p>In December 1795, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willbaroseboom1590.html">will</a> of his wife's bachelor <a href="../r/baroseboom1590.html">uncle</a> who probably was his business associate in the Mohawk valley.

<p>In 1786, he was among those who contributed to the salary of a second minister at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In <a href="../../doc/sl1825drc.html">1825</a>, he was among the Albany members who subscribed $250 to endowing a professorship at the New Brunswick Theological Seminary. Otherwise, his name appears to be absent from the extant church records. 

<P><a href="../../books.html#apkgans">F</a>amily-based resources tell us that he was determined to open his own store rather than take over his father's milling enterprises. After the war, he is <a href="#roseboom">said</a> to have built a house and store at Minden in new Montgomery, County. During the early 1800s, he <a href="http://threerivershms.com/simmsftplbridge.htm">appears</a> to have operated a store "at Abeel's" near Fort Plain.

      <p>However, after a successful two decades in the Mohawk Valley, in <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/browse/bookview.aspx?dbid=16133&iid=dvm_LocHist004087-00092-0&rc=738,1807,934,1849;919,1806,1209,1844;279,2589,579,2626;556,2959,771,3002&pid=87&ssrc=&fn=conrad&ln=gansevoort&st=g">1808</a> 
        Conrad turned his business over to Albany native Henry N. Bleecker. These 
        Gansevoorts relocated, first to Schenectady (Elizabeth's birthplace), 
        and then to Albany - the place of Conrad's birth. Beginning in 1815, his 
        address was given in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> 
        as 15 <a href="../../streets.html#montgomery">Montgomery Street</a>. 
      <p>In 1819, he was elected assistant alderman in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.

<p>Even as he aged through his fifties, "Coenrad's" household/family continued to grow. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, ten or eleven people were living in his home located on the corner of Columbia and Montgomery Streets.

<p>In 1826, he was mentioned in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=wd-LTleLtO8C&pg=PA334&lpg=PA334&dq=%22conrad+gansevoort%22&source=bl&ots=MdiL3JdH-Y&sig=k1NCrBtwYzsyEwDQbm08R9OcE8Y&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22conrad%20gansevoort%22&f=false">will</a> filed by his brother-in-law. At that time, Conrad was identified as "of Albany city, Esquire."

      <p>Conrad Gansevoort died in August 1829 while visiting family in Bath, Steuben 
        County. His son, Peter C. Gansevoort, had died there earlier in June. 
        Conrad's will passed probate in Albany later in the month. He was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA150&lpg=PA150&dq=conrad+gansevoort&source=bl&ots=SravROrlBi&sig=eROTP9hbGmnwe9PFkQrQVrQjKV4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjEm53JvKzLAhVokIMKHbFeALwQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&q=conrad%20gansevoort&f=false">buried</a> 
        in the Dutch church plot of the Washington Park cemetery. The graves of 
        several members of his family later were relocated to Albany Rural Cemetery. 
        Widow Elizabeth died in New Jersey in 1850.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. He was profiled in a Roseboom family history. Efficient <a href="http://www.gdcooke.org/ss/default.aspx/page/org2-o/p403.htm">online</a> family information.

        <p><a name=roseboom></a>From <a href="../r/roseboom.html#sources"><i>Roseboom</i></a>, 
          (comp. by Catherine Roseboom & others), p. 43. "Conrad Gansevoort was 
          a member of Isaac DeForeest's company, in the regiment of Col. Jacob 
          Lansing, Jr, first Albany County militia, raised in the city and commissioned 
          Oct. 20, 1775. On Mar. 3, 1780, he was made ensign of the company, Garrit 
          Groesbeck becoming captain in place of DeForrest, and on June 20, he 
          was made second lieutenant. After the close of the war, he established 
          himself in the mercantile business in the town of Minden, Montgomery 
          county, and erected a dwelling with a store in it on a knoll at the 
          foot of Sand Hill. He was a man much respected, and after years of successful 
          trading he retired from business and returned to Schenectady about 1812, 
          and subsequently to Albany - probably about 1816."
