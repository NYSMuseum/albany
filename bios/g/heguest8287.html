<P>The Albany resident known as  <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry Guest, Jr.</strong></a> was born about <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=mizzi&id=I5998">1759</a> or perhaps in 1765. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Perhaps, he was the son or kinsman of <a href="http://nbfplarchive.org/henryguesthouse/henryguest.html">Henry Guest</a> of New Jersey. He is <a href="http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.guest/148.2.1.1.1.2/mb.ashx">said</a> to have moved from New Brunswick to Albany. This subject almost always was <a href="../../res/sp.html">ref</a>erred to as "Henry Guest, Jr."

<p>In November 1787, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> called him a merchant with a shoe and leather warehouse in the house of the late 
<a href="../vd/hvdyck832.html">Dr. Van Dyck</a> at the corner of Court & State nearly opposite the southeast corner of the Dutch church.

<p>In October 1794, the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> noted that he was a merchant located at the corner of Court & State Streets. From then on, he can be called an Albany mainliner. In December <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#8287">1794</a>, he was among those who supported the establishment of Union College. In 1797, he was among those who petitioned for the incorporation of an Albany library. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a>, a list of Albany freeholders identified him as a merchant. Over the first two decades of the 19th century, he was an officer and director of a number of civic organizations.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, store, and lot in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</A> were valued on the Albany assessment roll. A year later, his household was configured with three young men on the Albany <a href="../../census1800.html#8287">census</a>. Subsequent censuses document his marriages and family.

<p>In December 1801, he married Elizabeth De Witt. at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their daughter was christened there in 1803. Elizabeth died in 1805. In December 1811, he married Jane Steele of Albany at the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>In 1806, he occupied a house and store on State Street that belonged to the <a href="../../wills/willgevzandt263.html#8287">estate</a> of Gerrit Van Zandt.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%22guest+henry%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=guest%20henry&f=false">1813</a>, city directories described the store and holdings of a leather merchant at 36 Lydius Street corner of Church.

<p>In July 1820, the newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=%22henry+guest%22+dead&source=bl&ots=xs4xcny_6V&sig=_BlPo7tSvzkxQ-ne2yfub8OTDoM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IisdUe4376vQAZbjgOgJ&ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22henry%20guest%22%20dead&f=false">reported</a> that the recently deceased Henry Guest, Jr. had transferred his share of a leather store and factory located on the corner of Lydius and Church Streets to <a href="../l/andlightbody.html">Andrew Lightbody</a>, his younger partner. </p>

<p>Albany merchant Henry Guest, Jr. was dead by the end of July 1820 when letters of administration were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">issued</a> on his estate.</p>
