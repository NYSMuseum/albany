<P>The surname <a href="#sources"><strong>Graham</strong></a> is often <a href="">encountered</a> in the annals of early Albany. Almost all of the early Albany Grahams were of <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> but probably represented several distinct family groups.

<p>The purpose of this exposition is to comprehend the Grahams <a href="../../criteria.html">of</a> early Albany. Our focus, therefore, requires us to keep the <a href="../../na/na.html">non</a> Albany owners of this surname at some distance. 

<p>We are mindful of the <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=wdhosey&id=I02525">notion</a> that the Scottish Grahams <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=--fS_FFn0z8C&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=mcharg+graham&source=bl&ots=mMIUYi17e1&sig=L32SSbvg_cCEXSu7t7SnzgMS_XI&hl=en&ei=iq8HTZSyCYP58Aayg73nBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=mcharg%20graham&f=false">changed</a> their names to McHarg (Graham spelled backwards) to mask their identities. The persistence of both names in Albany annals may complicate our study of the "Grahams" in the early city.

<p>Frontier trader and sometime Albany householder <a href="fegraham1129.html">Felix Graham</a> appears to be the first Graham to live in the city of Albany during the years following the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>.

<p>During the 1770s, perhaps a number of individuals named "John Graham" were active within the city of Albany. <a href="jograham8219.html">One</a> of them was an officer in the Revolutionary army. However, the existence of several same-named individuals in Albany during Major Graham's lifetime  <a href="../qqqq.html">gives us pause</a> at this time. 

<p>Dutchess County native <a href="thvwgraham8215.html">Theodorus Van Wyck Graham</a> settled in Albany at the close of the Revolutionary War. His son, Albany native  <a href="jotbgraham.html">John Ten Broeck Graham</a>, also an attorney, appears to have been a short-lived bachelor.

<p>The first Federal Census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> counted three Graham households in Albany (including <a href="../../census1790.html#magr">that</a> of Mary Graham). Possibly in addition, two "John Mc Hargs" were <a href="../../census1790.html#jomch">listed</a> as heads of Albany households on the city census as well.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, the household of "Hector Graham "a Negro" was one of five Graham-named households in the city. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22graham%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22graham%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory listed two prominent Albany Grahams.</p>

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">understand</a> that we do not have the early Albany Grahams under any logical control at this time.</p>
