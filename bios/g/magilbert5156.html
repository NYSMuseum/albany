<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Gilbert</strong></a> was born in May 1685. She was the daughter of <a href="jogilbert5155.html">John</a> and <a href="../vd/covdb5640.html">Cornelia Vandenbergh</a> Gilbert. She probably grew up as the eldest child of a former garrison soldier and would have been one of five children accounted for in <a href="../../census1697.html#126">1697</a> on a census of Albany householders. 

<p>In July 1706, Maria married <a href="../s/gespoor6527.html">Gerrit Spoor</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as born and living in Albany. The marriage produced at least five children who were christened in the Albany church where she was an occasional sponsor. 

<p>These Spoors made their <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6527">home</a> in Albany's second ward.

<p>Gerrit Spoor filed a <a href="../../wills/willgespoor.html">will</a> in April of 1719. At that time, he named Maria as co-executor and noted their five living children. He was dead by the folllowing July when the will passed probate.

<p>Family-based sources opine that perhaps widow Maria then moved to New York City where she witnessed the christenings of her grandchildren.

<p>However, widow Maria may have lived much longer. In <a href="../../census1756.html#55">1756</a>, the "meadhouse" of "Mary Spour" was listed on the census of Albany householders. At that time, this subject would have been more than seventy-years-old.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> definitive information on the widowhood and passing of Maria Gilbert Spoor </p>
