      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Dr. Peter Gansevoort</b></a> was born in July 1725. 
        He was the youngest son of <a href="leegansevoort4656.html">Leendert</a> 
        and <a href="../d/cadewandelaer6167.html">Catharina De Wandelaer</a> Gansevoort. 
        He grew up at the family brewery facing <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market 
        Street</a> and along the Albany <a href="../../loc/landscape.html">waterfront</a>. 
        At least two other same named contemporaries (including the famed "<a href="pegans.html">hero 
        of Fort Stanwix</a>") prescribe caution in the assignment of qualitative 
        information.</p>
      <p>With traditional <a href="gansevoort.html">family enterprises</a> staked 
        out by his older brothers, young Peter embarked on a more unique career 
        path when he was sent to Boston for medical training. The particulars 
        and duration of that education have not yet been uncovered. But by the 
        <a href="../../census1756.html#275">1750s</a>, he had returned home, married, 
        and set up an Albany-based <a href="../../trades/medical.html">medical 
        practice</a> that led to a lifetime of service to family members and their 
        kin.</p>
      <p>In 1752, he wed <a href="../t/geteyck4869.html">Gerritje Ten Eyck</a> 
        - sister of a former <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany. 
        By 1770, their ten children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        Church</a> where he was a pewholder.</p>
      <p>Known in local circles as "Dr. Gansevoort," he does not seem to have 
        been an active participant in business or trade and mostly stayed out 
        of civic affairs. He lived comfortably in a house <a href="../../wills/willleengansevoort.html">inherited</a> 
        from his parents, did serve in the militia, supported other community-based 
        activities, and later occasioned some <a href="../../books.html#apkgans">note</a> 
        as a classical scholar. His name appeared on an Albany freeholders list 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4670">1763</a>.</p>
      <p>His wife died in 1782. By the <a href="../../census1790.html#4662">1790s</a>, 
        he was a grandfather who had retired to his substantial Market Street 
        home more and more under the care of his grown children. However, his 
        household was configured on the third ward census in <a href="../../census1800.html#4670">1800</a> 
        (missing his deceased wife but with three younger women). Dr. Peter Gansevoort 
        died in March 1809 - shy of his eighty-fourth birthday. His will passed 
        probate two months later.</p>
