      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Willem Claese Groesbeck</strong></a> was born 
        about 1659. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> 
        pioneers <a href="cljgroesbeck3369.html">Claes</a> and <a href="../s/elstevens.html">Elizabeth 
        Stevens</a> Groesbeck. He grew up in a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader's</a> 
        home located on what became <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        in Albany. 
      <p>About 1684, he married <a href="../s/geerschuyler1727.html">Geertruy 
        Schuyler</a>, the daughter of early Albany's premier <a href="../s/schuyler.html">family</a>. 
        By 1701, the marriage had produced six children who were christened in 
        the church where Willem Claese was a member, <a href="../../drc.html#deacons">deacon</a>, 
        and a regular baptism sponsor. 
<p>This Groesbeck home also was on Pearl Street. It stood opposite the house of his father. His Albany property was accorded a moderate <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3381">assessment</a> 
        on the city tax rolls.
<p>Like his father, Willem Claese was an Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#089">mainstay</a>. Beginning at the inception of the municipal government in <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">1686</a>, he served as assessor and firemaster. Mainly a carpenter but also a businessman, he also served on juries. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1687">1687</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.  In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#3381">1715</a>, 
        he belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        company.  In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3381">1699</a>, 
        Willem Groesbeck joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king 
        of England. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3381">1720</a>, his 
        name was included on a list of sceond ward freeholders. 
      <p>Willem Claese Groesbeck died in December 1722 and was buried from the 
        Dutch church.
