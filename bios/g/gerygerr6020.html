<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referenced variously (Gerritsen), early Albany resident <a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit Ryerse</b></a> was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="ryegerr6010.html">Ryer Elbertse</a> and his wife, <a href="../b/mabarents.html">Maria Barents</a>. He <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Reyerse-1">may</a> have been born in Utrecht or in Westbrook. He accompanied his parents to New Netherland prior to 1664. In his early years, he may have been a trader operating <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">bet</a>ween New York and Albany - perhaps in partnership with his half-brother, <a href="../vs/ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> Van Schaick.</p>

<p>In 1665, he married <a href="../j/anjans6472.html">Anna Jans</a> in New York. Their last five children were baptized between 1683 and 1688 in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. Seven of his children were alive in 1694.</p>

<p>He was a trader and sailor who was able to acquire additional property in Albany and also owned a tanning pit. During the 1680s and 90, he served the community as juror, assessor, assistant, and in 1691 and '92 as an alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.</p> 

<p>Gerrit Ryerse filed a <a href="../../wills/willgerygerr.html">will</a> in 1694 and at that time called himself a "seaman" who was "sick of body but sound of mind!" His widow was alone in their third ward house in <a href="../../census1697.html#169">1697</a>. Three sons further established the family in Albany under the name "<a href="gerritse.html">Gerritse</a>."</p>
