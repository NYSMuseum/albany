<P><a href="#sources"><b>Sara Groenendyck</b></a> was born in April 1700. She was the daughter of Johannes and Delia Cuyler Groenendyck. Her father was <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County in 1698. She grew up in Albany and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> from where her father was a frontier trader.</p>


<p>In December 1729, she married promising newcomer <a href="../s/jastevenson3901.html">James Stevenson</a>. The marriage produced a number of children - some of whom were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a pewholder.</p>

<p>James Stevenson became a prominent businessman and official in Albany. But their marriage ended abruptly in June 1744 when Sara Groenendyck Stevenson died at the age of forty-four! She was buried in the Dutch church. John and her children continued to prosper in Albany and beyond.</p>
