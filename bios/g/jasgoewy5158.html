<P>Albany patriarch <a href="#sources"><strong>Jan Salomanse Goewy</strong></a> is <a href="goewy.html#sources">said</a> to have been christened in Amsterdam, Holland in October 1649. Thus, he was the son of Solomon and Barbara Abelse who probably brought their family to America during the 1650s. He is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been living in Albany in 1668.

<p>By the 1680s, he had married <a href="../l/caloock5933.html">Catharina Loockermans</a> and had begun to raise a family. By 1701, ten children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and frequent baptism sponsor.

<p>He was identified as an Albany householder in <a href="../../census1679.html#5158">1679</a>. In 1686 and for several years after, he served as an Albany <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. His landmark <a href="../../census1697.html#055">house</a> was located on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> near the Ryckman <a href="../../im/im1686.html">brewery</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5158">1699</a>, he signed a community document pledging loyalty to the king of England. In that year, he was identified as a "wheelwright." His home was valued modestly on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5158">1720</a>, he was identified as a freeholder living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. 
 
<p>Probably into his eighties, Jan Salomanse Goewy died in September 1731. His widow may have survived him.
