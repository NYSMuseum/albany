<P><a href="#sources"><b>Henry Glen</b></a> was born in 1739. He was the 
        son of Albany residents <a href="jaglen4927.html">Jacob</a> and <a href="../c/elcuyler400.html">Elizabeth 
        Cuyler</a> Glen. He was the younger brother of <a href="joglen4934.html">John 
        Glen, Jr.</a> and often was referred to as "Henry Glen, Jr."</p>
<p>In December 1762, he married <a href="../v/elvisscher.html">Elizabeth Visscher</a> of Schenectady. By 1785, the marriage produced seven children who were baptized in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch churches</a> of Albany and Schenectady where their parents were members.</p>

<p>Henry Glen was a businessman (possibly a frontier peddlar in his younger 
        days) but primarily a <a href="#land">land trader</a>. He owned residences 
        in both Albany and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 
        In 1766, his Albany property was assessed at 30 pounds - a substantial 
        levy denoting upper-echelon wealth. At the same time, he was identified 
        as a Schenectady "alderman." In <a href="../../census1790.html#4923">1790</a>, 
        his third ward Albany residence included seven slaves. But by 1800, he 
        had moved and his household appeared on the Schenectady census.</p>
      <p>Henry Glen is best known for service to the Patriot cause during the 
        <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">American Revolution</a>. In 1775, he was 
        elected to represent Schenectady on the Albany County <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a>. He held militia commissions and was sometimes called 
        "Colonel." His principal contribution was in the Quartermaster Department 
        where he <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#4923">served</a> as Assistant 
        Deputy QMG and was headquartered in Schenectady. Glen was associated with 
        George Washington and accompanied the future president on his tour of 
        the Mohawk Valley in 1783.</p>
      <p>His <a href="jaglen4929.html">sister</a> married <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham 
        C. Cuyler</a> - the last mayor of Albany under the British and an exiled 
        Tory. 
      <p>Henry Glen held a number of public offices over a long career. He was 
        appointed "town clerk" for Schenectady in 1767. He was elected to represent 
        Albany County in the first three Provincial Congresses in 1775 and 1776. 
        After the war, he was elected to the New York State Assembly for Albany 
        County in 1786 and for new Schenectady County in 1810. He was elected 
        to the United States House of Representatives in 1793, 1795, 1797, and 
        1799. During the Revolution, he also served as an Indian Commissioner. 
      <p>Revolutionary stalwart Henry Glen died in Schenectady in January 1814 
        at the age of seventy-five.</p>
