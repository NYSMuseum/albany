<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Given</strong></a> served as Albany <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> from 1796 to 1800. 

<p>We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. However, he probably was born about 1760. Or <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Kh3qGte3QVkC&pg=RA1-PA154&lpg=RA1-PA154&dq=%22given,+john%22+ulster&source=bl&ots=5C3aH72MgL&sig=ML_SHFZ0-5StF2oTPEXmXbOabd0&hl=en&ei=bF8XTa7oKIL58AaMp6zoDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q&f=false">perhaps</a>, he was the John Given named as a son or grandson in the will filed by John Given of Ulster County in 1751.

<p>He does not appear to have been in Albany during the era of the American Revolution.

<p>In 1785, he was a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. Perhaps he did not marry as we find no family information for him in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In September 1787, he was paid from the city treasury.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, a "John Given" and an unnamed (and of an unspecified age) female were identified in a household on the census for the town of <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#8189">1794</a>, he was among those who subscribed in support of Union College.

<p>In September 1796, Given was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany city and county. As such, he was required to hold no other office and to be a resident of the county. He served until superceded in the Fall of 1800. Official papers and legal <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=L8gDAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA450&lpg=PA450&dq=%22john+given%22+albany+sheriff&source=bl&ots=BCuRt3Sq42&sig=WZ-XUs6q-okkwi8S3U3mVk_cjmo&hl=en&ei=7XgXTbK5JMP78AaClOC8Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CBsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&q=%22john%20given%22%20albany%20sheriff&f=false">actions</a> regarding the course of his tenure have been preserved in a number of private collections. His "<a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">Day Blotter</a>" for/from 1798 has been a useful source of community information. 

<p>During the late 1790s, he acquired at least one waterfront <a href="../../res/realestate.html">lot</a> from the city. That property was sold following his death in 1806.

<p>The Albany assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, assessed his personal property under the first ward house of <a href="../f/jafairlie8015.html">James Fairley</a> which it appears that Given shared with a Black woman who possibly was the absentee Fairlie's housekeeper. He also owned a lot and wharf on the third ward waterfront. A decade later, the second ward census for <a href="../../census1800.html#8189">1800</a>, noted John Given, another man about his age, and a boy under ten in a <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household. In 1804, he was <a href="../../res/ts.html">id</a>entified as a resident of <a href="../../streets.html#dock">Dock Street</a> who boarded two state senators.

<p>The assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a> noted his lot on <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</A> and stated that he was a non resident.  

<p>John Given's passing in March 1806 was noted in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=%22john+given%22+sheriff+albany&source=bl&ots=2hQtJU0B2y&sig=-7RwSwPkO6-ypAd4Fvge4WaTiW4&hl=en&ei=BskUTeGsNcT48AbUn_3mDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20given%22%20sheriff%20albany&f=false">newspaper</a>. Letters of administration were issued on his estate in October 1806.</p>
