<strong>John Geyer</strong></a> (sometimes Johan George or John G. Geier) probably was born during the 1740s. Several same-named individuals became prominent in American cities during the second half of the eighteenth century.

<p>This individual appears to have settled in Albany during the 1780s. In September 1788, his account was paid by the city <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a>. In 1791, he was a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fire</a>man in a first ward engine company.


<p>His wife's name was Susanna. Their daughter was christened at the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> in  April 1765. At least from 1786 on, both parents were members and pewholders at First Lutheran. He was church treasurer and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=z8ISAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA54&vq=geyer&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1_1">later</a> was called "the honest Mr. John G. Geyer" by a former pastor. He also was the church <i>vorsinger</i> or "chorister" for a number of years. In 1790, he was renting property on the "Lutheran Grounds" at thirteen pounds annually.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#8169">1788</a>, his house and belongings in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> were valued on the Albany assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8169">1790</a>, his household including only one female was listed on the census. By 1800, he had relocated to <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> where the <a href="../../census1800.html#8169">census</a> configured his household with a man and a women - both persons being born before 1756. 

<p>John Geyer was dead by July 26, 1809 when letters of administration were issued on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a>.
