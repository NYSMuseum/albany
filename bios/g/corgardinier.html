<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelia Gardinier</b></a> was born in October 1691. She was the daughter of <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> millwright Jan Jacobse Gardinier and his wife, Sara Van Bremen. Her paternal grandfather once lived in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>.</p>


<p>By 1713, she had married garrison soldier <a href="../c/obcooper495.html">Obadiah Cooper</a> and was living in Albany. By 1735, the last nine of her twelve children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were frequent baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Coopers lived in a first ward <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">neighborhood</a> that had been settled by former <a href="../../garrison.html">soldiers</a>. There, she raised her large family with less of a family network than most Albany mothers. Her husband, an Albany newcomer, was a tailor who died in 1742. </p>

<p>Dutch church burial records state that Cornelia Cooper was buried in April 1748.</p>
