<P><a href="../../res/guess.html">Per</a>haps a number of individuals named <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Gill</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">maybe</a> Giles) lived in Albany during the second half of the eighteenth century. This <a href="../../res/bios.html#note">note</a> <a href="../../res/guess.html">att</a>empts to organize the <a href="../../cbr.html">com</a>munity-based information encountered so far.

<p>In 1756, a census of Albany homes made by the British army <a href="../../census1756.html#144">noted</a> the "good house" of "Mr. Gill," a merchant, and listed it with the same entry number as that of "J. Cuyler." However, it appears that two separate holdings were enumerated. That listing showed that Gill's four-room home was suitable for four soldiers and that Gill's family occupied two of those rooms. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> additional information on that individual. He is not the same person as the city resident who follows.

<p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8184">1779</a>, the second ward assessment valued the personal property (no real property valued) of "William Gill" along with twenty-two others at the end of the ward list. The next available tax list is from <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a> but his name is absent from it.

<p>In November <a href="../../org/cc.html#1787">1787</a>, "William Gyles" was one of those who were qualified as constables for the third ward by the city council. He also was named high constable.
 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#8184">1790</a>, the census of the second ward showed a man and woman in the house of "William Giles." A decade later, the census again configured the <a href="../../census1800.html#8184">household</a> of William Giles. It showed a man born between 1756 and 1774 (eliminating the Gill listed in 1756), a boy and a girl under 10, and a female between 10 and 16 years of age.

<p>A membership list for the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a> includes the name of William Giles.

<p>Beyond the above, the <a href="../../res/sp.html">name</a> of William Gill/Giles is mostly <a href="../qqqq.html">absent</a> from the community-based record <a href="../../res/irs.html">encountered</a> so far.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. We understand that more than one person under that general name lived in Albany during the second half of the eighteenth century.
