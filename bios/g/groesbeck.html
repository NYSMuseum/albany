<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, the Albany <a href="#sources"><b>Groesbecks</b></a> were descended from <a href="cljgroesbeck3369.html">Claes Jacobse</a> and <a href="../s/elstevens.html">Elizabeth Stevens</a>, his wife, who came to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and were long-time residents of Albany. Their daughter, <a href="bargroesbeck3262.html">Barbara</a>, became the wife of Gysbert Marselis about 1682. Their son, <a href="stgroesbeck3377.html">Stephanus</a>, became a prominent Albany personage.  In 1722, daughter, <a href="cagroesbeck3268.html">Catharina</a>, married Pieter Schuyler, Jr.

<p>The marriage of mainline trader <a href="jogroesbeck3351.html">Johannes Claese</a> in 1699 produced a large family at least one of whom <a href="wogroesbeck.html">migrated</a> north to the Albany farmland at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> where subsequent generations flourished.

In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, four Groesbeck-named households were listed on a census of Albany householders. By that time, the family had marked four generations of residence in the city  
<p>By the era of the American Revolution, a <a href="jogroesbeck3355.html">number</a> of family members had become shoemakers who also worked <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning pits</a> located along Foxes Creek.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, four Groesbeck households appeared on the Albany census in the second and third wards and four more in the town of <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">Watervliet</a>. By <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, seven Groesbeck-named households were counted on the city census and three in Watervliet.

<p>The first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=groesbeeck&source=bl&ots=2iMtPZ-y5x&sig=s81Dvt4wTNAgbTm0cj4uFRb7tW8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IDayUNihC8nf0QHu2IHYBg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=groesbeeck&f=false">1813</a>, listed ten "Groesbeeck" addresses. They mostly were located in proximity to the house and store of <a href="cogroesbeck3283.html">Cornelius W. Groesbeck</a> at 4 North Pearl and 319 North Market Streets respectively.

<p>In 1874, the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groesbeckville,_Albany,_New_York"">Groesbeckville</a>" portion of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> was <a href="../../citylimits.html">annexed</a> by the city of Albany. Today, the "South End/Groesbeckville Historic District" encompasses a good part of the old South End and is one of thirteen historic districts within the city of Albany. 

<p>Initially, the family <a href="http://www.houseofnames.com/Groesbeck-history?A=54323-292">appears</a> to have been of germanic origins. Today, the Groesbeck family is found round the world. A number of <a href="http://www.cityofgroesbeck.com/">places</a> across the <a href="http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?view=2&surname=groesbeck">United States</a> bear the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groesbeck">name</a> of this prominent early Albany family.
