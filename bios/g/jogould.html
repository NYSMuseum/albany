<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously and based on subsequent resources, Albany resident <a href="#sources"><strong>Job Gould</strong></a> was born about 1766. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional resources tell us that he was of <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=goRAAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22new+england+in+albany%22&source=bl&ots=Wm3aT1Q5vh&sig=blRDLLlJsIxF_79Cpm-gCziIhjw&hl=en&ei=mBfcTO_XOoW8lQeuiMyuCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=job%20gould&f=false">Rhode Island</a> and probably Quaker) origins. However, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>He was the brother of businessman Thomas Gould. In <a href="../../doc/nn3.html#1798">1798</a>, their <a href=https://books.google.com/books?id=V5UPAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22job+gould%22+albany&source=bl&ots=PB1Q1kGoVh&sig=4h_-kV6_OzdafBGL8HwCWW4KLMM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj5rLPzgJPVAhViwYMKHRT6C0gQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&q=%22job%20gould%22%20albany&f=false"">partnership</a> (with Benjamin Dickinson) was dissolved with Job Gould continuing the business at 13 <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court Street</a>. These Yankees appear to have been the hardware <a href="../../econ/comec.html#mer">business</a>.


<p>He probably married about 1790. His wife was named Mary. In 1807 and 1815, his infant children were <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in the Episcopal <a href="../../guide/histres.html#deathinfo">and</a> Friends cemeteries.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot in the first ward and his personal property were valued modestly on the city assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#8174">1800</a>, his (Job <a href="../../res/sp.html">G</a>old) first ward household consisted of a young boy, a young man, and an adult male aged 26-45. Two females aged 26-45 completed the household. A decade later in 1810, the total household membership had reached eight people.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22job+gould%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=gould&f=false">1813</a>, city directories listed his address as 42 Court Street (later 425 Market and 470 South Market) and his occupation as merchant. His was one of four Gould-named addresses appearing in 1813. In 1816, the directory gave 33 Beaver Street as the address of his house. 

<p>The Albany newspaper reported that Job Gould died in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA370&lpg=PA370&dq=%22job+gould%22source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=snippet&q=job%20gould&f=false">April 1846</a> at the age of eighty. Letters of Administration were issued on his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">estate</a> in Albany County on April 9.

        <p>From <a href="../../fhg.html#nea">NEA</a>: "Thomas Gould, came here from R. 
          I., and carried on the hardware business, about 1790. At first his brother, 
          Job Gould, and Benjamin Dickinson were associated with him. After 1795, 
          each of the Goulds carried on the same business separately; both acquired 
          fortunes. Thomas d. April 22, 1820." (Copied from p. 86).
