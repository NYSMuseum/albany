<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in February 1691. He was the son of <a href="wmgroesbeck3381.html">Willem</a>  and <a href="../s/geerschuyler1727.html">Geertruy Schuyler</a> Groesbeck and was named for the Groesbeck American patriarch. As the eldest of six children, he grew in the Pearl Street home of a successful merchant in close proximity to his Groesbeck kin and was a <a href="../s/schuyler.html">Sch</a>uyler grandson as well. His father would die in 1722 but his mother survived until 1748. 

<p>About 1711, Nicholas married his <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North end</a> neighbor  <a href="../q/maq2206.html">Maria Quackenbush</a> - <a href="http://awt.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=flakey&id=I101763621&ti=5542">reportedly</a> in Albany. By the time of her death in December 1728, the marriage had produced seven children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where the parents were occasional baptism sponsors. In September 1729, he married <a href="../vc/jovc.html">Johanna Van Corlear</a> Rumney also in Albany. Johanna was a middle-aged widow with a number of children. This second marriage appears to have been childless.

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=%22nicolaes+groesbeeck%22+clay&source=bl&ots=GuM8-o4GJJ&sig=8plxzJBvqMHCR2u9wJwRksXtgIE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1MqfUKehJu3k2wXaooDgDw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false">1728</a>, he and a <a href="../vd/wmvdb5861.html">partner</a> were granted a six year lease to dig clay in the city of Albany.

<p>At some time after the second wedding, these Groesbecks re-located to New Jersey. Thus, Nicholas had moved <a href="../../na/na.html">beyond</a> our focused sweep of community-based resources.

<p>In November 1750, he was identified as the husband of Johanna and as living in New Brusnwick in the <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a> filed by his mother in law. Nicholas Groesbeck died there in 1754. </p>
