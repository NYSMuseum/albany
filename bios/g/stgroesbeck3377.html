<P><a href="#sources"><b>Stephanus Groesbeck</b></a> was born in 1662. He was the American born son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="cljgroesbeck3369.html">Claes Jacobse</a> and <a href="../s/elstevens.html">Elizabeth Stevens</a> Groesbeck. He grew up in a large family in the <a href="../../beverwyck.html">village</a> that became Albany in 1664.</p>


<p>In July 1699, he would have been in his late thirties when he married young Albany native <a href="../l/ellansing3231.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a>. By 1709, nine of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members, frequent baptism sponsors, and where Stephanus was a church officer and deacon. In 1714, he joined with other notables in contributing to the new <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.</p>

<p>Coming of age during the early 1680s, his name was conspicuously absent from community rolls. Later wealth and his service as an interpreter suggest that he was involved in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> - perhaps beyond the Albany stockade.</p>

<p>Even before his marriage, Stephanus had his own <a href="../../census1697.html#122">Albany house</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3377">1699</a>, he joined other Albany residents in swearing allegiance to the King of England. Over the next decade, city <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3377">assessment</a> rolls valued his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property with that of the most affluent merchants.</p>

<p>Civic involvement spanned several decades. In 1694, he was constable for the second ward. After that, he served as collector, firemaster, and surveyor. Later, he served as <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> for the first ward and was a member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. He owned a number of houses in Albany and lived in both the first and second ward. His home on Pearl Street was mentioned in his will.</p>     

<p>External holdings were numerous and diverse. They included lands on both sides of the Mohawk and in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>; at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html">Fort Hunter</a>; at Hoosick; and in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. 

<p>Stephanus Groesbeck filed a <a href="../../wills/willstgroesbeck.html">will</a> in August 1743. It bequeathed an extensive estate to his wife and children He died in July 1744. His widow survived for another decade.</p>
