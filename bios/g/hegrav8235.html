<strong>Hendrick Graverat</strong></a> probably was born during the 1660s. He then would have been the son of New York City burgher <a href="../../sources.html#bf">and</a> freeman Isaac Graverat.

<p>We have not enountered information relating to his early adulthood or clues to why he was able to undertake such an advantageous marriage.

<p>In May 1686, he was identified as a "young man of New York" when he married <a href="../s/sasanders1444.html">Sara Sanders</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. From seven months later to 1699, three children were christened in the Dutch church. Hendrick "Greefraadt" had been a member of the Albany church since 1683 and was an occasional baptism sponsor. His <a href="isgrav8238.html">son</a> became a mainline Albany resident. 

<p>In March 1699, his wife wrote in the family bible that Hendrick Graverat had died. Shortly thereafter, she took her small family to live in Albany. In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1444">1709</a>, the name "Sara Greveraet"  was on the Albany assessment roll as the owner of a  <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property. She died in 1727.
