<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Gerritse</b></a> was born in May 1717. She was the daughter of tradesman and landholder <a href="jagerr6008.html">Jan Gerritse</a> and his second wife <a href="../w/mawinne3008.html">Maria Winne</a>.</p>


<p>She was twenty-six in November 1743 when she married Albany blacksmith <a href="../vs/wevschaick3990.html">Wessel Van Schaick</a>. By 1758, five of her children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor. In 1745, she was named in the will of her mother to inherit a share of her estate and a "great looking glass."</p>

<p>As her husband made the transition from tradesman to merchant, these Van Schaicks lived in the heart of the first ward <a href="../../loc/experiment.html">waterfront</a> residential area in a substantial home attended by several servants.</p> 

<p>Wessel Van Schaick died in 1783. Maria was left <a href="../../wills/willwevschaick.html">use</a> of his substantial estate during her widowhood. She was attended by her youngest son <a href="../vs/gewvschaick3953.html">Gerrit</a> - a bachelor, but was listed as the head of their household on the <a href="../../census1790.html#6009">census</a> in 1790. 

<p>Maria Gerritse Van Schaick died in January 1797 and was buried from the Dutch church!</p>
