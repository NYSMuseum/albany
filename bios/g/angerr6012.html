<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Gerrits Marselis</b></a> probably was born during the 1660s. She was the daughter of Manhattanites <a href="gerygerr6020.html">Gerrit Ryers</a> and his wife, <a href="../j/anjans6472.html">Anna Jans</a>. Her father was a would-be trader who moved his family to Albany during the 1680s.</p>

<p>She married <a href="../vb/marjansvb.html">Marcellus Jans Van Bommel</a>. In <a href="../../wills/willmarjansvb.html">1690</a>, five of their children were still alive. At that time, her husband's will named her as "sole and universal heir." Several of them established themselves in Albany and its hinterland under the name of <a href="../m/marselis.html">Marselis</a>.</p>

<p>In 1694, she probably was living in Albany when she was <a href="../../wills/willgerygerr.html">left</a> a share of her father's estate.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#174">1697</a>, Anna and her husband were living alone in an Albany house. Marcellus Jans was dead by 1700. In 1702, the modest holdings of "Anna Marselis" were listed on the city assessment roll in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Anna Gerrits Marselis died after 1702.</p>
