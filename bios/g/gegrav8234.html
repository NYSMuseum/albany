      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Gerrit Graverat</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> 
        Graveraet) was born in April 1745. He was the last of eleven children 
        born to the marriage of <a href="isgrav8238.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="algerr6005.html">Alida 
        Gerritsen</a> Graverat. However, most of his ten siblings did not survive 
        to raise families of their own. His father was an middling mainstay of 
        the water level <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north end</a> of the 
        city. 
      <p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#8234">1766</a>, he joined his neighbors 
        in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty. The next year, 
        he was on the <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#8234">roster</a> of 
        an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. Perhaps 
        he was the "son" living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</A> 
        with "Alida Geveraet" (his widowed mother) in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>. 
        However, that individual may have been his older <a href="hegrav8237.html">brother</a> 
        who did become an Albany resident 
      <p>Some time after that, this younger son went west - reaching Detroit as 
        early as 1769 (reportedly in the employ of <a href="#employ">Is</a>rael 
        Ruland). He ultimately become a <a href="../../trades/silver.html">silversmith</a> 
        in association with the Albany <a href="../h/harsen.html">Harsens</a> 
        who would establish themselves on an <a href="http://www.michmarkers.com/startup.asp?startpage=L0511.htm">island</a> 
        in the St. Clair River as early as 1778. Gerrit Graverat married their 
        daughter <a href="../h/saharsen8353.html">Sara</a> - who was twenty years 
        younger than Graverat. The marriage produced four sons and a daughter 
        who settled in the Great Lakes region. 
      <p>Gerrit Graverat died about 1790 on Harsen's Island. His widow lived until 
        1802.</p>

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Gerrit Graverat 
        is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 8234. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> 
        is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. 
        <p><a name=employ></a>The terms of Graverat's arrival in Detroit are the 
          subject of some <a href="http://er.uqam.ca/nobel/r14310/Kinzie/index.html">debate</a>. 
          Did he work for the Long Island-born Ruland or for <a href="../h/jaharsen8350.html">Jacob 
          Harsen</a> - his future father-in-law? He sometimes has been referred 
          to as "Isaac" Graverat. The Lakes-region <a href="http://www.pure-michigan.com/michigan15/1.php">story</a> 
          of this Albany native and of his in-laws is fascinating but beyond the 
          scope of this website.
