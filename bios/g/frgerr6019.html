<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Frederick Garrison</strong></a> was born about 1730. At this point, we do not believe that he was a member of the Albany <a href="gerritse.html">Gerritse</a> family. Variations in the spelling of his name probably inhibit development of his biography. However, this individual was an Albany resident for several decades.

<p>His wife was Maria Tuck <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Dock. During the 1750s and 60s, a number of daughters were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html#">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#249">1756</a>, his name appeared on a census of Albany householders. Over the next four decades, his first ward <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6019">property</a> was valued modestly on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>.

<p>In 1768 and 1774, his account was paid by the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">gov</a>ernment. In May 1776, he was identified as a carman with an account for three pounds by the <a  href="../../coc.html">Albany committee</a>. We seek additional information on his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>time activities.


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6019">1790</a>, his riverside household included four females. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#6019">later</a>, three females aged 26-45 and an older woman joined him in his Albany home.

<p>After that, he seems to have left the city. 

<p>We seek defining information on his origins and later life.</p>
