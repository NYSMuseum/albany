<P>In <a href="../../census1800.html#8290">1800</a>, the Albany city census configured the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household of <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Guest</strong></a> with three children and two adults. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, the second ward assessment roll valued his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick Street</a> modestly. At this point, these seem to be the only references to him in the comprehensive community record. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>He probably was born during the early 1770s. Perhaps his <a href="http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.guest/148.2.1.1.1.1.1.1/mb.ashx">parents</a> were John and Sarah Jordan Guest of Middlesex, New Jersey. Perhaps he came to Albany with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=lang_en&q=+site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+guest#bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&fp=6bca067c8a03085d&hl=en&lr=lang_en&q=site:www.nysm.nysed.gov+albany+guest&tbs=lr:lang_1en">family</a> members during the era of the American Revolution.

<p>He is said to have <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rHJWAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA57&dq=%22guest,+thomas%22&source=bl&ots=2W_z42TBlU&sig=HCIt5hql_I1HFvqPOMHjj230k0M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=9EQKUr23EfPJ4APksIGIDA&ved=0CFgQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&q=%22guest%2C%20thomas%22&f=false">marr</a>ied <a href="../s/geerschuyler.html">Gertrude Schuyler</a> - <a href="#marr">perhaps</a> in 1793. At least seven children subsequently were <a href="../../drc.html">christened</a> in Albany to parents identified as "Thomas Guest and Gertrude Schuyler."
 
<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Albany resident Thomas Guest. </p>
