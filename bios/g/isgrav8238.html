      <P><a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible18.htm">Acc</a>ording 
        to the family bible, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Graverat</strong></a> 
        was born in July 1695 and was christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> in New York City on June 27. He was the son of <a href="hegrav8235.html">Hendrick</a> 
        and <a href="../s/sasanders1444.html">Sara Sanders</a> Graverat. His father 
        probably died while Isaac was quite young but his widowed mother survived 
        until 1727. He probably grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, his name appeared 
        on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia 
        company</a>. The next year, he witnessed a baptism at the Albany church. 
      <p>In November 1727, Isaac married <a href="algerr6005.html">Alida Gerritsen</a> 
        at the Albany church. By 1745, eleven children had been christened in 
        Albany whose names reflect family-based naming patterns. During that time, 
        at least eight of his children were buried from the Dutch church. However, 
        sons <a href="gegrav8234.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="hegrav8237.html">Hendrick</a> 
        survived to lead historically visible Albany lives. 
      <p>In June 1729, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a> 
        noted that the street and lane abutting his house and lot were to be paved. 
        In March 1734, a notice of impending public works referenced his lot as 
        touching the water in an area that was to become a dock. In January 1752, 
        with his wife, he <a href="../../res/realestate.html">conveyed</a> two 
        lots north of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> to an 
        unnamed buyer. In 1747, they had been left the lots in the <a href="../../wills/willelgerr6006.html">will</a> 
        of Alida's father. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#8238">1742</a>, his name appeared 
        on a list of freeholders living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. However, in <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, his name 
        was not included on a census of householders in the city of Albany. 
      <p>Isaac Graverat may have died during the spring of 1759 or in April 1761 
        when money was due for his pall. Later, in 1766 and 1767, his widow was 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> for taxes on their 
        modest third ward property. </p>
