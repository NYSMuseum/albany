<P><a href="#sources"><b>Magdalena Gansevoort</b></a> was born in August 1777. Her parents were <a href="leogans4666.html">Leonard</a> and <a href="../c/hecuyler537.html">Hester Cuyler</a> Gansevoort. The daughter of a member of the State legislature, she grew up in a substantial <a href="../../loc/estatemkt.html">State Street</a> home - virtually an only child until the birth of a sister in 1789.</p>

<p>Consequently, she was trained on the piano and educated in New York City until illness brought her home to Albany in 1792. The following year, she reputedly was the reason that a disgruntled suitor conspired to have her father's stables set on fire - which caused a substantial portion of the city to be <a href="../../fire.html">burned</a>. The affair created quite a <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html#scandal">scandal</a> in the city! After that, these Gansevoorts relocated to their recently acquired country estate called <a href="../../na/whitehall.html">Whitehall</a>. 

<p>In March 1795, she married <a href="../t/jaate4822.html">Jacob Ten Eyck</a>. The couple lived at Whitehall where they raised their seven children. She inherited the property as well as his wharf when Leonard Gansevoort died in 1810.</P>
