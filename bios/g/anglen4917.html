      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Anna Glen</strong></a> was born during the late 
        1670s. She was the daughter of Albany mainstays <a href="jaglen4926.html">Jacob 
        Sanders</a> and <a href="../w/cawitbeck1708.html">Catharina Witbeck</a> 
        Glen. 
      <p>About 1699, she married her childhood neighbor <a href="../w/hawendell2667.html">Harmanus Wendell</a>. By 1714, the marriage had produced seven children who were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member.

<p>Anna raised her family in a landmark townhouse on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. Her husband was a successful businessman who owned additional parcels of land beyond and below Albany's main street.
 
<p>Harmanus Wendell died in 1731 at the age of fifty-three. Anna Glen Wendell lived for more than two decades in her State Street home. She died in September 1756 - probably in her seventies, and was buried from the Albany church.
