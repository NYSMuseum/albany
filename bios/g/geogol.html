<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to <a href="#var">var</a>iously, we have established that <a href="#sources"><strong>George Golden</strong></a> was an <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro-Albanian</a> who lived in Albany from at least 1815 until his <a href="../../res/death.html">death</a> during the cholera epidemic of 1832.

<p>A notice from the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> dated August 25, 1832, stated that he died of cholera, was 70 years old, and resided at 11 <a href="../../streets.html#tromp">Van Tromp Street</a>. Thus, his birth date would be approximately in 1762. We seek particulars regarding his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and prior  life.

<p>In <a href="../../art/art-jls.html">1815</a>, his name (Golen) first appeared in the city directory. He was <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">identified</a> as a laborer and a resident of 51 Fox Street. His name was italicized meaning that he was a "free person of color." Perhaps he was son (or other kin) of <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> George Golden, the slave of widow <a href="../r/coryckman.html">Cornelia Price</a>, who was <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2715051?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">freed</a> on June 3, 1807. At that time, the elder George was 86 years old. Also, perhaps he was connected to <a href="../qqqq.html#one">a</a> "Widow Golden" whose name (not <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">ital</a>icized) appeared in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> in 1815 and 1816 and who lived in the rear of 77 <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver</a> Street. His name (still italicized) appeared in subsequent directories at varied (yet close by) addresses until at least 1830 when he was identified as a laborer at 4 Fox Street.

<p>In <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/1820-United-States-Census/126203/005157010/81#row-15">1820</a> (Golden identified as free black, 1 older male, 2 females) and in 1830 (Gaulden), his household was configured on the Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">census</a> for the second ward.

<p>Afro-Albanian George Golden was dead two years later.

<p>Following our most recent sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a>-based resources under several likely <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>ellings, and with basic <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> still unresolved, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
