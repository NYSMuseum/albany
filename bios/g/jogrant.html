<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Grant</strong></a> (the older) was living in the Albany area at least during the late 1750s.

<p>His wife may have been Margaret Angus. Their daughter was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> in May 1759 where he also witnessed a baptism. Thus, he would have been born probably prior to 1740. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>A younger,  <a href="jogrant8225.html">same-named individual</a> lived in the city afterwards (perhaps in the same household).

<p>This John Grant has not been definitively linked to an Albany residency. Perhaps he was the city householder of the late 1770s and afterwards. But, perhaps (probably at this point) not!

<p>If not, he would <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> meet our <a href="../../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion among the people of colonial Albany. A John Grant was living in southern <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> during this subject's effective lifetime.</p>

<p>With so many fundamental <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> outstanding, we move on for now. At this point, he has been included as we suspect he may have been the father of at least one early Albany resident.</p>
