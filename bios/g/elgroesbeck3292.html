<strong>Elizabeth Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in August 1707. She was the daughter of Albany leaders <a href="stgroesbeck3377.html">Stephanus</a> and <a href="../l/ellansing3231.html">Elizabeth Lansing</a> Groesbeck. She grew up in a State Street businessman's home with several <a href="../../wills/willstgroesbeck.html">siblings</a> who would become prominent Albany and area residents.


<p>In July 1729, she married <a href="../vr/stvr.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. He was the younger brother of the lord of Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>. By 1742, six children had been christened in Albany where she was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Van Rensselaers were <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#stvr">residents</a> of Albany when Stephen succeeded to the Patroonship on the death of his brother in 1745. However, their elevated status was shortlived as the sickly Stephen died two years later at  the age of forty. His <a href="../../wills/willstvr.html">will</a> left Elizabeth with substantial assets and the right to reside at the <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a>.

<p>Owner of several Albany properties in and beyond Albany, "<a href="../../census1756.html#118">Mrs. Ranslow</a>" was identified as the resident of a large house on a <a href="../../census1756.html">census</a> taken by the British army during the summer of 1756.    

<p>Elizabeth filed a <a href="../../wills/willelgroesbeck3932.html">will</a> in November 1756. "Madame" Elizabeth Van Rensselaer died at the end of the year. She had lived forty-nine years. Her <a href="../vr/svr5114.html">son</a> became lord of the Manor and a <a href="../vr/elvr5068.html">daughter</a> would be the wife of General <a href="../t/abtbroeck6.html">Abraham Ten Broeck</a>.</p>
