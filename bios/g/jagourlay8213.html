      <P><a href="#sources"><b>James Gourlay</b></a> (perhaps <a href="../../res/sp.html">also</a> "Gurley") was a <a href="../../econ/comec.html">mer</a>chant in Albany for a few years prior to the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">W</a>ar for Independence. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.</p>
      <p>In December 1771, he called himself a merchant with a store in the house 
        of <a href="../r/joroorbach.html">John Roorbach</a> in <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Cheapside</a> 
        in an advertisement printed in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a>. 
        His stock included fabrics, cutlery, shoes, and books, and that he was 
        a lottery agent. He also belonged to the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic 
        lodge</a>.</p>
      <p>On his deathbed, he identified <a href="../s/anschuyler1084.html">Anna 
        Schuyler</a> as his "putative wife" but disavowed responsibility for the 
        "male child she has." However, the boy grew up as <a href="jagourlay8214.html">James 
        Gourlay</a> and became a prominent Albany merchant!</p>
      <p>James Gourlay filed a <a href="../../wills/willjagourlay.html">will</a> 
        in October 1772. It identified his father, James Gourlay, and his brothers 
        and sister. He was dead by December 17 when the will passed probate.</p>

        <a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of James Gourlay is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 8213. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived
