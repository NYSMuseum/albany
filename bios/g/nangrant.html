<P>According to subsequent information, Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nancy (or Ann) Grant</strong></a> was born in Scotland during the 1750s.

<p>By 1779, she had married <a href="../c/alclark7617.html">Alexander Clark</a>. By 1789, perhaps five of her children had been christened at the albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch</a> and <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> churches.

<p>Although Clark was an Albany property holder and tradesman, no household was configured on the city census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. Alexander Clark died in 1795.

<p>In 1799, the assessment roll noted the personal property of the "widow of Clark" below the house and property of John Clark in the second ward. In <a href="../../census1800.html#8226">1800</a>, Ann Clark's second ward home also included five young people in the same vicinity.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22clark+eagle%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22clark%20eagle%22&f=false">1813</a>, two separate widows named Ann Clark were listed in the first city directory. The residence of widow "Nancy Clark" at 63 Eagle Street appeared in the directory for several years.

<p>In August of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=%22alexander+clark%22+albany&sig=FPah92Lq7foYAgqF17aYdiv2R2s&ei=4HdMUfc1xbvgA6WDgaAI&id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&ots=GuN92q0LJB&output=text">1830</a>, the Albany paper reported that "Ann, widow of Alexander Clark, died, aged 78. She was a native of Scotland, but had resided in Albany more than half a century."</p>
