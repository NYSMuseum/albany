<P><a href="#sources"><b>Peter Gansevoort</b></a> was born in July 1749. He was the eldest son of prominent businessman <a href="hagansevoort4662.html">Harmen</a> and <a href="../d/magdouw90.html">Magdalena Douw</a> Gansevoort. He grew up with many siblings in the <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">family home</a> on Market Street. He sometimes was known as Pieter Jr. to prevent confusion with <a href="pegansevoort4670.html">older</a> kinsmen.

<p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/pegans.jpg" align=right width=240 height=290 alt="General Peter Gansevoort" border=2 vspace=4 hspace=4></a>As most of the existing scholarship on this subject has focused on his military exploits, this sketch seeks to shed light on Peter Gansevoort in his Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a> - as a resident of the city of Albany.

<p>Both of Harme Gansevoort's sons followed their father in family-based 
        business enterprises. Peter pursued processing (chiefly <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewing</a> and lumbering) 
        and shipping operations while <a href="leogans4666.html">Leonard</a> practiced 
        law and moved toward public service. Like his brother, Peter was an emerging 
        young leader on the eve of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Revolution</a>. 
        However, his budding career was put on hold when <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> broke out in 1775.</p>

      <p>Previously holding a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> commission, 
        in May 1775 Peter Gansevoort was commissioned a major in the New York 
        regiment of the Continental army. Rising to Brigadier General, he <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> 
        throughout the Revolutionary war. He participated in the invasion of Canada 
        in 1775; was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and given command of the Third 
        New York Regiment at Lake George in June 1776; gained renown as the defender 
        of Fort Stanwix in the summer of 1777; served at Saratoga, in the Mohawk 
        Valley, and in the mid-Hudson. He was promoted to Brigadier General of 
        the New York militia in 1781.</p>

<p>Peter was twenty-nine in January 1778 when he married <a href="../vs/cavschaick3942.html">Catharina Van Schaick</a> - the daughter of an Albany merchant, at her <a href="../vs/jogvschaick3963.html">brother</a>'s island <a href="http://www.vanschaickmansion.org/?page_id=24">estate</a> in today's Cohoes. Between 1779 and 1791, their six children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#91">home</a> was next door to his father's house on Market Street. Peter took charge of the family brewery following the death of his uncle, <a href="jogansevoort4665.html">Johannes</a>, in 1781. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4683">1788</a>, young <a href="cogansevoort4683.html">Conrad Gansevoort</a> also held a place in his home.</p>

<p>After accompanying General Washington on his tour of northern battlefields in 1783, "the hero of Fort Stanwix" <a href="../../census1790.html#91">settled</a> into a business life in Albany. He was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany city and county in 1790 and served until 1792. In <a href="../../census1800.html#91">1800</a>, his home was served by four slaves. In charge of a number of <a href="gansevoort.html">family</a> properties on <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a>, his economic focus was on the Albany <a href="../../doc/nn2.html#pegans">brewing operation</a>, and on grinding, lumbering, and sawing at the "<a href="http://www.saratoga.com/business/snook-kill-falls-16657/">Snook Kill</a>" Falls in new Saratoga County. He had purchased confiscated loyalist lands there at the end of the war and was <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/NYALBANY/2002-05/1020947910">developing</a> a mill town at the place now called "Gansevoort."</p>

<p>He contracted a "cold" during the winter of 1811-12 which lingered for 
        the remainder of his life. General Peter Gansevoort died in July 1812 
        a few days shy of his sixty-third birthday. His <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=378">monument</a> 
        stands in Albany Rural <a href="../../dead.html">cemetery</a>.</p>
