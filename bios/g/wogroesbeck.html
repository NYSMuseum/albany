<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Wouter Groesbeck</strong></a> was born in October 1712. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jogroesbeck3351.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../q/geerq2104.html">Geertruy Quackenbush</a> Groesbeck. A number of similarly-named individuals are at risk during his lifetime. This individual grew up a middle child in the family of a middling Albany trader and <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> landholder.

<p>We currently <a href="../../res/guess.html">sur</a>mise that this Wouter married Albany native <a href="../b/jabogert6116.html">Jannetje Bogert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in December 1739. By 1758, at least seven children whose names honored the grandparents were christened in Albany.

<p>We suspect that this Wouter Groesbeck became a resident of Schaghticoke and/or possibly was connected to <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Ha</a>lfmoon as well.

<p>In November <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=%22wouter+groesbeeck%22&source=bl&ots=sulVex89Vi&sig=GEaqE9cv5BxfqXCpNBDvSJfik0c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=_XKzUNm8Ncm_0AHtkIDIDw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22wouter%20groesbeeck%22&f=false">1736</a>, he "<a href="../../res/realestate.html">bought</a>" land in Schaghticoke from the city corporation. Its boundaries and terms of "sale" were defined at that time. Over the next two dcades, he either paid or was in arrears for rent on his Schaghticoke property.

<p>In the summer of 1756, the legendary "homestead" of Wouter Groesbeck (near the juncture of the Tohannock and the Hoosac) was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PhYzAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22wouter+groesbeck's%22+schaghticoke&source=bl&ots=hd00SvmQQk&sig=aHs6O-ZVelS5P3o42475nttxagU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=HEyyUI2jHInA0QGK_4GgBg&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22wouter%20groesbeck's%22%20schaghticoke&f=false">attacked</a> by French and Indian raiders.

<p>During the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">1760s</a>, the name of "Wouter Groesbeck" appeared on assessment rolls for Halfmoon (two Wouters) and for the West Manor of Rensselaerswyck.

<p>The household of this individual was not configured on the Albany County census in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. At that time, he would have been approaching eighty years of age.

<p>With unresolved <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> and issues regarding the life and passing of this Wouter Groesbeck, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
