<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Patrick Gahagan</strong></a> was living in Albany during the early 1770s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Perhaps he was of <a href="../irish.html">Irish</a> ancestry.

<p>In September 1772, marriage banns for Gahagan and one "Sarah Lambert" were published for the first time in the records of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. No further references have been uncovered in the records of early Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.


<p>In October 1773, his activities were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA251&lpg=PA251&dq=%22cews&source=web&ots=wwdCeXsdiv&sig=cE7RQPd903sx6yow_wDK8-B3PVo#v=onepage&q=%22patrick+%20gah&f=false">considered</a> during an enquiry of voter eligibility in the election for city councilmen. The city records noted that previously Gahagan had lived at the house of <a href="../h/rihilton7618.html">Richard Hilton</a> and, for more than the last twelve months, at <a href="../b/maburk4394.html">Mrs. Mc Cew's</a>. He had not stayed there for five weeks but his bed and clothes still were at the widow's house. Currently, he was working for lodging at James Moore's [?] and "he lives up at Graveraedt's in <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Voisen Kill</a>." He was a <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor</a> who presently was working for Mr. <a href="../b/jaburk7490.html">Burks</a>.  The scrutiny ended on October 5 when Gahagan's vote was declared "good." 

<p>After that, no further references for Patrick Gahagan have been encountered in our ongoing search of community-based records and also of the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">records</a> of the American Revolution. For <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, we have found no references to Patrick in the first federal census for old Albany County and for New York State.</p>
