<strong>Maria <a href="../../res/sp.html">G</a>errits</strong></a> probably was born during the 1740s. She was the daughter of one of the many similarly named families (including Van Ness and Van Wie) living in the Albany area at that time. Her father may have been named "Hendrick."

<p>In November 1767, she married blacksmith <a href="../h/ishogan4320.html">Isaac Hogan</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1771, three children had been christened in Albany.

<p>These Hogans lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Isaac had a smithy.

<p>However, the marriage was shorlived as Isaac Hogan was "sickly" when he wrote his <a href="../../wills/willishogan4320.html">will</a> in January 1773. She was named executor and beneficiary. None of her children were identified or included in the will which passed probate in November 1774.
