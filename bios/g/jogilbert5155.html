      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Gilbert</b></a> probably was born during the 
        1650s. He was of English ancestry.</p>
      <p>About 1684, he married <a href="../vd/covdb5640.html">Cornelia Vandenbergh</a>. 
        By 1697, three of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where both parents were members and occasional baptism sponsors.</p>
      <p>During the 1670s and 80s, <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court records</a> 
        identifed him as a <a href="../../garrison.html">soldier</a> and a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> 
        where he appeared frequently as a litigant and as attorney. As early as 
        <a href="../../census1679.html#5155">1679</a>, he was listed on a census 
        of Albany householders. In 1681, court minutes revealed that he was in 
        possession of the house of his deceased <a href="../vd/arvdb.html">father-in-law</a> 
        located on the west side of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        - north of Maiden Lane. The Gilberts appear to have <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nkHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA289&lpg=PA289&dq=%22john+gilbert%22+albany&source=bl&ots=-hGPn0Q2A4&sig=DIMfQxyyH6ECT7fzo4DR9km8Es0&hl=en&ei=2gFsTKGBDYWKlweshJm_AQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CBoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20gilbert%22%20albany&f=false">sold</a> that property in 1685.
		
		
      <p>In 1689, he was identified as a corporal among the soldiers on duty at 
        the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> at Albany.</p>
      <p>Over three decades, his name appreared regularly on Albany rolls. In 
        <a href="../../census1697.html#126">1697</a>, his household included five 
        children. At that time, he was identified as "English." Two years later 
        he joined his Albany neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5155">swearing 
        allegiance</a> to the king of England. In 1702, his second ward property 
        was assessed comparable to the holdings of other production class residents. 
      <p>John Gilbert died in May 1707. His widow, "Cornelia," was listed on an 
        Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">assessment roll</a> for the 
        second ward in 1709. </p>
