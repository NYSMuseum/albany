      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Harme Gansevoort</b></a> was born in April 1712. 
        He was the first child born to brewer <a href="leegansevoort4656.html">Leendert 
        Gansevoort</a> and his wife, <a href="../d/cadewandelaer6167.html">Catharina 
        De Wandelaer</a> Gansevoort. He grew up learning the workings of business 
        and trade at the <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">family properties</a> 
        that ran from Market Street to the river.</p>
      <p>After some time as a frontier <a href="#trade">trader</a>, Harme opened 
        a store on Market Street in 1739. Soon, he was importing directly from 
        London. His multifaceted business career carried the Gansevoort family 
        out of the production and service classes and into Albany's commercial 
        elite. He held the ferry for several years and the new dock built behind 
        his house during the mid-1760s was known as "Harme Gansevoort's wharf." 
        By that time, he was among the city's wealthiest merchants and his riverside 
        home was an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#266">landmark</a>!</p>
      <p>In May 1740, he married Albany native <a href="../d/magdouw90.html">Magdalena 
        Douw</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where 
        he was a lifelong member, church officer, and occasional baptism sponsor. 
        Their nine children were baptized there between 1741 and 1759. The marriage 
        united two former Lutheran, <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland families</a> 
        and brought both into the provincial mainstream.</p>
      <p>In 1736, Harme was appointed constable for the third ward. In 1748, he 
        was elected assistant alderman and then alderman. He served on the <a href="../../corporation.html">city 
        council</a> for more than ten years and was active in its operations. 
        Transformed beyond ethnicity, this English speaker was closely connected 
        to the British establishment. In 1750, he was appointed Albany city and 
        county clerk - a potentially lucrative position that brought him into 
        closer contact with the royal government. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4662">1763</a>, 
        his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.</p>
      <p>In September 1762, he was identified as the eldest son and heir in the 
        <a href="../../wills/willleengansevoort.html">will</a> filed by his father. 
      <p>However, bitterness over loss of the clerkship in 1764 and the emergence 
        of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">issues</a> with the British in the years 
        that followed, brought this third generation American to the realization 
        that America's destiny might not be compatible with the British colonial 
        plan. His <a href="gansevoort.html#sons">sons</a> followed in Harme's 
        commercial footsteps and also became leaders in the course of action that 
        brought Albany from resistance to rebellion and then to <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">revolution</a>.</p>
      <p>Although his sons became the visible heads of the family during the era 
        of the American Revolution, Harme continued in business, managed expanding 
        real estate holdings, and presided over a Market Street complex that was 
        served by numerous <a href="../../census1790.html#4662">slaves</a> - including 
        a Pawnee captive named <a href="#jan">Jan</a> who lived with the Gansevoorts 
        for a decade.</p>
      <p>Harmen Gansevoort lost his wife in 1796. He died in March 1801 at the 
        age of eighty-eight. His will passed probate in September.</p>

        illustrative material on Harme's career that fosters hope that we may 
        be able to similarly articulate the lives of his contemporaries!
