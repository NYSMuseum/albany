      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Leonard Gansevoort</b></a> was born in July 1751. He 
        was the son of Albany mainstays <a href="hagansevoort4662.html">Harman</a> and <a href="../d/magdouw90.html">Magdalena Douw</a> Gansevoort. 
        He learned the elements of business and trade growing up in his father's 
        house across from the Albany <a href="../../loc/markethouse.html">Market</a>. 
        By the early 1770s, he also began to practice law.</p>

      <p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/leogans.jpg" align=right width=190 height=220 alt="Leonard Gansevoort" hspace=4 vspace=4 border=1></a>He 
        married <a href="../c/hecuyler537.html">Hester Cuyler</a> in 1770. Over 
        the next two decades, their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a church officer and regular baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Elected to the city <a href="../../corporation.html">council</a> while still 
        living in his father's third ward home, by the outbreak of the war, he 
        had moved his family to a more spacious home on <a href="../../loc/estatemkt.html">lower 
        State Street</a> where they would live for the next two decades.</p> 

<p>A committed revolutionary, he served on the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>, was elected to the Provincial Congress - where he served as president in 1777, was appointed Albany County clerk in 1778, and served for many years in both houses of the New York State Legislature.</p>

<p>As he grew in wealth and stature, Gansevoort invested in real estate within 
        and beyond Albany. During that time, his State Street <a href="../../census1790.html#4666">home</a> 
        was an Albany <a href="../../loc/estatemkt.html">landmark</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1789, he purchased the farm called <a href="../../na/whitehall.html">Whitehall</a> 
        from the <a href="../s/jobrschuyler.html">son</a> of General Philip Schuyler. Following the <a href="../../fire.html">fire of 1793</a>, he 
        moved out to Whitehall and began to add more rooms to accommodate his 
        growing family. The Whitehall property technically was just inside the new town (district) called <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. The census for 1800 shows his Bethlehem property was attended by thirteen slaves.</p>

<p>Leonard Gansevoort died unexpectedly in August of 1810. He had just passed his fifty-ninth birthday! His will passed probate four months later.</p>
