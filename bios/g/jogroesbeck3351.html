<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Johannes Claese Groesbeck</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s. Perhaps he was the last son born to Albany residents <a href="cljgroesbeck3369.html">Claes Jacobse</a> and <a href="../s/elstevens.html">Elizabeth Stevens</a> Groesbeck. He grew up in a prosperous business family with an Albany <a href="groesbeck.html">headquarters</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>Perhaps he was accounted for under his father's <a href="../../census1697.html#131">house</a> on the Albany census in 1697. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3351">1699</a>, Johannes Claese joined his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">Later</a>, his own second ward property was valued on Albany assessment rolls 

<p>In December 1699, he married <a href="../q/geerq2104.html">Geertruy Quackenbush</a> in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1720, nine children had been christened in Albany.
 
<p>Like his father, he was a <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3351">mainline</a> Albany merchant. He served as firemaster, on juries, and, in <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#3351">1715</a>, as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. He also held land in <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. 


      <p>Johannes Claese Groesbeck was last heard from in September 1734 when he was 
        paid by Albany for "use of the great guns and carriages." One <a href="http://www.heritagepursuit.com/GarwoodMinnie.htm">source</a> 
        claims he died in Albany County on June 30, 1746.</p>
