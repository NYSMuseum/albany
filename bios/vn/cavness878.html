<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Van Ness</strong></a> was born during the 1730s. We seek defining information on her parents and date of birth. However, it appears that she was the daughter of a Hendrick and Johanna Van Ness.

<p>In July 1756, she married thirty-one-year-old <a href="../b/tebradt4281.html">Teunis Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>. At that time, both partners were "of Albany." By 1775, eight children had been christened in the church where she was a seat holder and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Bradts made their <a href="../../census1790.html#4281">home</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> near the house of Teunis' widowed mother. Teunis was known in the community as a master carpenter and served the city government and the Revolutionary cause in that capacity.

<p>However, Teunis Bradt died during the 1790s. In early August 1797, a <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html">fire</a> broke out in "the widow of A. Bradt's" stable in <a href="../../streets.html#montgomery">Montgomery Street</a> and spread to destroy a sizeable section of the old city. It also consumed her dwellinghouse and displaced Catharina and two additional families at the Montgomery Street address. It was the largest <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> in the city's history. However, widow Catharina was listed on city assessments as the owner of record there beginning in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>.

<p>Her household does not seem to have been enumerated separately on the city census in <a href="../../census1800.html#third">1800</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, the Montgomery Street house and lot of the "Widow of Tunis Bradt" was valued on the third ward assessment roll. After that, her name no longer appeared on Albany rolls.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Albany widow Catharina Van Ness Bradt. </p>
