<strong>Cornelis Van Ness</strong></a> was born in Albany about 1670. He was the son of <a href="gevness899.html">Gerrit</a> and Maria Van Ness. His mother died while he was a boy. His father was an Albany mainstay who re-married in 1677.</p>

<p>In July 1695, Cornelis married <a href="../vd/mavdb5817.html">Maria G. Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1706, three children had been christened in Albany.

<p>This Van Ness family set up their <a href="../../census1697.html#079">home</a> in Albany where Cornelis signed a loyalty oath in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#886">1699</a>. However, his property does not seem to be valued on the Albany assessment roll for <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">1709</a>. 

<p>In 1715, he was a member of John Schuyler's <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html#886">troop</a> of horse.


<p>Cornelis Van Ness is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been living in Halfmoon in 1720. However, he was not mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willgevness899.html">will</a> filed by his father in 1715. </p>
