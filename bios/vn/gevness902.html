<strong>Gerrit Van Ness</strong></a> was born in January 1702. He was the son of one-time Albany residents <a href="covness886.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdb5817.html">Maria Vandenbergh</a> Van Ness. He sometimes was known as "Gerrit C. Van Ness."

<p>In August 1724, he married <a href="../vd/savdb5842.html">Sara Vandenbergh</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1744, eight children had been christened in Albany.

<p>Gerrit C. Van Ness was a <a href="../../census1756.html#261">carpenter</a> whose <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home for several decades was an Albany landmark. After serving as firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1728">1728</a>, he was elected alderman three times beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1745">1745</a>. His name appeared on Albany  freeholder lists in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#902">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#902">1763</a>. His name also appeared on city rolls to be paid for contract work.

<p>In 1765, he was deposed regarding the so-called will of <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html">Jochem Staats</a>. His name did not appear on Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> during the 1760s and 70s. Perhaps he was the "Gerret Van Ness" whose Halfmoon  property was valued during that time. In February 1780, a "Gerrit Van Ness" testified before the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">Commissioners</a>. Gerrit C. Van Ness would have been in his late seventies. We seek information on his passing.</p>
