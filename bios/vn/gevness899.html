      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit Van Ness</b></a> was born about 1645. He 
        was the son of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> Cornelis 
        Hendricks and his first wife, Maria/Maycke Van Der Burchgraef Van Ness.</p>
<p>In October 1674, he was among those <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html">invited</a> to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer. 
      <p>In February 1677, he married widow <a href="../t/mateller6616.html">Maria 
        Teller</a> Van Allen. She may have been his second wife! He was the father 
        of several children - none of whom were alive in 1715. He was a member 
        and deacon of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1679, his name was included on a <a href="../../census1679.html#899">census</a> 
        of Albany householders. He was a wheelwright by trade but this Albany 
        <a href="../../census1697.html#087">mainstay</a> owned property in the 
        third ward that was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessed</a> 
        comparable to that of a successful merchant. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#899">1699</a>, 
        he joined with his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England.</p>
      <p>From the 1680s on, he served the community as constable, firemaster, 
        and assessor and was elected assistant and then alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third 
        ward</a>. In 1702, he testified in court and gave his age as fifty-seven. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#899">1709</a>, his third ward 
        property was accorded a substantial assessment.</p>
      <p>Gerrit Van Ness filed his last <a href="../../wills/willgevness899.html">will</a> 
        in March 1715. It left his wheelwright's tools to his wife's son, <a href="../va/wivallen5687.html">Willem 
        Van Allen</a>. The will passed probate in June.</p>
