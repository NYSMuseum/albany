<strong>Jan Van Ness</strong></a> probably was born during the 1640s or early 50s. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="covness887.html">Cornelis</a> and Maria Van Ness.

<p>Perhaps during the late 1660s, he married a woman named "Aaltie" (possibly Wemp or Vanderheyden). The marriage produced at least four children but probably was still larger. Their last child was christened in 1689 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>After some years in <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">residence</a> just outside the stockade, this Van Ness family made its <a href="../../census1697.html#087">home</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In 1709, his property was <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#968">assessed</a> at a modest rate. During those years, he also <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#968">signed</a> a number of community based petitions.


<p>On a number of occasions and in several jurisdictions, Jan Van Ness was called on to serve as an assessor and watchman. He <a href="http://users.crocker.com/~jcamp/jvn.html#1">appears</a> to have held <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> at Kinderhook, Halfmoon, Hoosick, and elsewhere in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>.

<p>In March 1708, he filed a <a href="../../wills/willjavness.html">will</a> that stated he was residing in <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. It named his wife, son, and three living daughters as his heirs.

<p>After 1710, his name no longer appeared on Albany rolls. He probably was dead by 1720 when his name was absent from a <a href="http://www.genealogy-quest.com/collections/nyalby.html">list</a> of freeholders in greater Albany County. However, He is <a href="http://www2.crocker.com/~jcamp/jvn.html#1">said</a> to have been buried at Half Moon in January 1734.</p>
