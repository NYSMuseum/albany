<P><A href="#biography"><B>Johannes Van Ness</B></A> was born in June 1739. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="../../bios/vn/covness889.html">Cornelis</a> and Susanna Swits Van Ness.</P>

      <P>In December 1762, he married Hester Gerritse of <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a> 
        at the Schenectady Dutch Church. Over the next twelve years, their five 
        children were baptized in Schenectady.</P>

<p>In 1763, Van Ness purchased a lot on the hill in Albany. In 1766, his modest property was listed on the Albany assessment rolls. Later, he added a <a href="../../loc/wout.html">vacant</a> lot or two to his holdings. Over the next three decades, he was a cooper who lived on <a href="../../streets.html#orange">Orange Street</a> and whose shop was on Pearl.</p>

<p> He was identified as a private in one of the Albany companies of the provincial militia in 1767. A decade later, he qualified for a bounty as a member of the first regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#922">1790</a>, he was living with his wife and two children in their second ward house. By 1800, Hester had passed and his household consisted of three adult men.</p>


<p>Johannes Van Ness died in April 1808 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church.</p>

        The life of <B>Johannes Van Ness</B> is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</A> 922. This profile is derived chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. Development of his biography is complicated by the lives 
        of several John Van Nesses living at the same time in the Albany area!</p>
