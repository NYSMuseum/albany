      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dirckie Van Ness</strong></a> was born before 
        1680. She was the daughter of <a href="jovness968.html">Jan</a> and Aalite 
        Van Ness. She grew up in a mid-sized family in <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North 
        Albany</a> near the north gate of the city. Her father also owned properties 
        in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a>. 
      <p>In March 1698, she married <a href="../w/dawinne.html">Daniel Winne</a> 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1726, ten 
        children had been christened in Albany where both parents were members. 
      <p>In March 1708, she was named with her mother, brother, and two sisters 
        in the <a href="../../wills/willjavness.html">will</a> filed by her father. 
      <p>Following their marriage these Winnes made their home in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        where Daniel engaged in farm-related activities. 
      <p>Dirckie Winne was identifed with her eight living children as the heir 
        in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA482,M1">will</a> 
        filed by her husband in 1757. 
      <p>She died sometime thereafter.</p>
