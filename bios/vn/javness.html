<P>According to <a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/VanNess-77">one</a> family-based resource, this <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jannetie Van Ness </strong></a> was born in May 1711. She is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been born in New Jersey. However, <a href="../../res/guess.html">perhaps</a> more plausible is that she was christened in April 1713 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> as the daughter of <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a> residents Evert <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/Contributions-for-the-Genealogies-of-the-First-Settlers-of-the-Ancient-County-of-Albany-From-1630-to-1800-2/374202/134">and</a> Geertje Vandenbergh Van Ness. Perplexed if not bewildered, we still seek defining information on her precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>.

<p>In September 1732, she married Albany native <a href="../w/cowaldron649.html">Cornelis Waldron</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1749, the marriage had produced eight <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/Contributions-for-the-Genealogies-of-the-First-Settlers-of-the-Ancient-County-of-Albany-From-1630-to-1800/173591/158">children</a> whose names honored the  grandparents. Her husband may have been married previously but a first union does not seem to have yielded surviving children.

      <p>For more than two decades, these Waldrons raised their family in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        area</a>. However, their public life has scarcely surfaced as a result 
        of our latest sweep of our family <a href="../../cbr.html">and</a> community-based 
        resources. Thus, we surmise that they may have been more identified with 
        the Albany <a href="../../albanycounty.html">countryside</a>. 
      <p>Cornelis Waldron <a href="../w/cowaldron649.html#death">died</a> in May 1756 and was buried from the Albany church. In June of that year, perhaps a newly widowed Jannetie Van Ness Waldron was the "Mrs. Waldrum" who was identified as a "<a href="../../trades/cloth.html">Ma</a>ntuamaker" on a <a href="../../census1756.html#324">census</a> of Albany householders made by the British army.

<p>It appears that the widow Jannetie Van Ness Waldron lived for several more decades. During the mid-<a href="../../sources.html#uny">1760s</a>, her property at the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a> was valued moderately and in close proximity to that of her sons.

      <p>Perhaps she <a href="http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/VanNess-77">died</a> in Monmouth, 
        New Jersey in January 1792. Thus, she would have lived into her eighties. 
        However, this is not a conclusive scenario and we seek more definitive 
        information on her widowhood and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.
