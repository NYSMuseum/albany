<strong>Gerrit Van Ness</strong></a> was born about 1681. He was the son of Albany area resident <a href="hevness911.html">Hendrick Van Ness</a> and his first wife, <a href="../e/aneverts.html">Anna Everts</a> Van Ness. This Gerrit lost his mother at an early age and his father re-married in 1688. In December 1702, he was twenty-one when he testified in an Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#court">court</a>.  His older <a href="gevness899.html">uncle</a> and namesake was an Albany resident who died in 1715. 

<p>In June 1709, he married a somewhat younger <a href="../d/cadforeest4708.html">Catharina De Foreest</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1724, five children had been christened in Albany where both parents were regular baptism sponsors.

<p>In April 1710, the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a> contracted with him to set up new stockadoes and dig ditches.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#901">1720</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders living in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. The same-named individual on the freeholders list for <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#902">1742</a> probably was his nephew.

<p>Gerrit Van Ness <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nycoloni/chbur_v.html">buried</a> his wife in March 1743. Into his sixties, he probably died some time thereafter.</p>
