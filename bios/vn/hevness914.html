<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick G. Van Ness</strong></a> was born in January 1715. He was the son of <a href="gevness901.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../d/cadforeest4708.html">Catharina De Foreest</a> Van Ness. This son of Gerrit was known as "Hendrick G." to prevent confusion with same-named contemporaries.

<p>By the mid 1740s, he had married <a href="../w/mgtwinne3006.html">Margarita Winne</a>. She died at the end of 1754 after bearing three children. In August 1759, he wed <a href="../v/magvro.html">Magdalena Vrooman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1767, three more children were christened in the church where he received other services as well.

<p>Perhaps he was the "Hendrick G. Van Ness" identified in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6UdbEIAEit8C&pg=PA582&lpg=PA582&dq=%22van+ness%22+&source=bl&ots=_rOgLKAyzd&sig=o7gPc8XtCgMWfWQo-UxR3XVB98I&hl=en&ei=1VgOTIncCoa0lQfvkcRs&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&q=%22van%20ness%22&f=false">1736</a> as a partner in the operation of an Albany <a href="../../trades/brickstone.html">brick</a> kiln by a notable <a href="../../sources.html#ht">traditional resource</a>. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> verification of that claim.

<p>In June <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=%22hendrick+gerritse+van+ness%22+foxes&source=bl&ots=sulW5wa9Xp&sig=2ngNoC0LLdfwR7yxHgqpfTuW340&hl=en&sa=X&ei=edq0UM2AKfC10AHV2oD4CQ&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22hendrick%20gerritse%20van%20ness%22%20foxes&f=false">1736</a>, he was one of those who "purchased" lots on the north side of <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a> from the city corporation. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1739">1739</a>, he was named constable for the third ward. Over the next three decades, he was re-imbursed for performing civic services.

<p>In June <a href="../../census1756.html#260">1756</a>, "Henrick Van Ess" was identified as a merchant on a list of Albany householders made by the British army. On a number of occasions before and afterwards, he was referred to as a trader and businessman. During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his third ward property was assessed in line with other Albany merchants.<br>

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#914">1763</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders in the Albany area.

<p>After the 1760s, the name of Hendrick Van Ness <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#hvn">appears</a> in the community-based record on several occasions. At this point, we are <a href="../../res/guess.html">not able</a> to definitively link this individual to those resources.
 
<p>With outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the later life and passing of Albany resident Hendrick G. Van Ness, we move on <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">for now</a> </p>
