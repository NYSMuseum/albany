<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hendrick Van Ness</strong></a> probably was born before 1650. He was the son of <a href="covness887.html">Cornelis Van Ness</a> and his second wife, the widow Maria Damen. Hendrick grew 
        up in the Albany area where his father's home was listed on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
        census in 1697. 
<p>In October 1674, he was among those <a href="../../lists/list1674jvrfun.html#911">invited</a> to the funeral of Jeremias Van Rensselaer.

<p>In October 1663, he married <a href="../e/aneverts.html">Anna Evertse</a> at the Dutch church in Wiltwyck. By 1681, the marriage had produced at 
        least eight children. In November 1688, he was a widower when he married 
        <a href="../vd/cavdam6350.html">Catharina Van Dam</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>, where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor. By 1694, 
        his second marriage had added several more children.

<p>In 1688, he was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willjjoo.html">will</a> of his brother-in-law. 		
		
		
<p>In 1688, he was one of those named in the granting of the <a href="../../na/hoos.html">Hoosick Patent</a>. That land would remain in the Van Ness family for generations to come.
	 
<p>Like his father, he lived in the Albany area but would not be part of the community mainstream. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#mg">1689</a>, 
        he was identified as a farmer in Marte Gerritse's company. In <a href="../../census1697.html#911">1697</a>, 
        his household including six children was configured on the Rensselaerswyck 
        census. But in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#911">1709</a>, his 
        <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> Albany house was accorded 
        a moderate assessment. 
<p>Perhaps this Hendrick Van Ness was dead by 1720 as his name was not included 
        on the <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">list of freeholders</a> in 
        any of the jurisdictions in greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a>.</p>
