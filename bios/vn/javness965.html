<P><A href="#biography"><B>Jannetje/Janet/Jane Van Ness</B></A> was born about 1739.</P>

          <P>She married Schenectady native <a href="../y/ryates.html">Robert Yates</a> 
            in March 1765. The couple set up their first home in Albany's second 
            ward. Their six children were baptized in the Albany Dutch church 
            between 1767 and 1783 where their parents were longtime members.</P>

          <p>Attorney, public official, and jurist, Robert Yates's rapid rise was mirrored 
            by the elevated status that accompanied success. By the outbreak of 
            the War for Independence, his family had taken up residence in a <a href="../y/ryates.html#yateshouse">landmark 
            house</a> on upper State Street where Jane raised their children and 
            hosted many of the leaders of the new New York State.</p>

          <p>Robert Yates died in 1801. Jane continued to live in the home at 110 State 
            Street which she shared with her son and husband's successor, <a href="../y/jvnyates.html">John 
            Van Ness Yates</a>. She died in June 1818 at the age of seventy-nine.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Jannetje/Jane Van Ness Yates</B> 
            is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 965. This profile is derived chiefly 
            from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. We have 
            been unable to make a definite connection with the Van Ness family 
            of Albany County. However, we expect she was the daughter of a Johannes 
            or Pieter Van Ness!</p>
