<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rynier M. Van Iveren</strong></a> was born in December 1728. He was the eldest son of Albany residents <a href="myvi2466.html">Myndert</a> and <a href="../w/arwyn6200.html">Ariaantie Wyngaert</a> Van Iveren. He grew up in a blacksmith's home in the second ward where he was appointed constable and firemaster in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1753">1753</a> and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a> respectively. 


<p>In September 1760, he was <a href="../../wills/willmyvi2466.html">left</a> his father's house and also Myndert's negro slaves. His ailing father did not survive and Rynier's widowed mother continued to be identified as the owner of the house through the 1760s.
 
<p>In August 1759, Rynier married silversmith's daughter <a href="../f/defielding.html">Debora Fielden</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1775, six children had been christened in Albany where both parents were pewholders. The children's distinctive names (Meinard and George, for example) reflected those of their grandparents.

<p>This individual was the eldest of a number of same-named contemporaries - at least <a href="../../census1790.html#2479">one</a> of whom also was an Albany resident.

<p>In <a href="../../solconst.html#2479">1766</a>, he was among the Albany men who signed a document (Sons of Liberty constitution) protesting the Stamp Act. We believe that a <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/minutesalbanycou01newyrich#page/89/mode/2up">different</a> and younger same-named individual was actively involved in the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>.
 
<p>This Rynier (Reineer) Van Iveren was a trader and <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#2479">merchant</a> who set up his home on the west side of <a href="../../im/immktstcol.html">Market Street</a> where he <a href="../../census1790.html#2479">lived</a> for the remainder of his life. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">Assessment rolls</a> for the <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#2479">remainder</A> of the eighteenth century valued his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2479">third ward</a> holdings in two locations. In <a href="../../census1790.html#2479">1790</a>, his household included five slaves.

<p>Rynier Van Iveren lost his wife early in 1786. This individual probably was not the Reineer who was buried in February 1793. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his Market Street holdings were valued  moderately. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2479">1800</a>, his household included only him and two females. Aged seventy-two in 1800, after that, his name no longer was found on city rolls.</p>
