<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rynier Myndertse</strong></a> probably was born during the late 1670s. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer <a href="myvi2465.html">Myndert Frederickse</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vv/pivvechten2562.html">Pieterje Van Vechten</a> Van Iveren. Rynier grew up in the Albany home of a one-time trader turned blacksmith. He was one of four brothers named in the <a href="../../wills/willmyfvi.html">will</a> filed by his father in March 1704.

<p>In September 1699, he married Albany native <a href="../b/sabradt4360.html">Sara Bradt</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1717, nine children had been christened in the church where he was a pewholder and regular participant. He also appears to have had some connection with the less well-established <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2477">1699</a>, he first appeared on the community landscape when he swore allegiance to the king of England. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1699lo">1700</a> and afterwards, he joined in community-based petitions to the royal authorities. In 1715, he was a <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#2477">member</a> of an Albany 
<a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. Beginning in 1700, he served in a number of service positions including that of juror, firemaster. and "waymaster."

<p>Rynier Myndertse was a prominent <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> and his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> holdings were valued substantially on city <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2477">assessment rolls</a>. Like most members of his family, he probably followed the <a href="../../trades/metal.html">smith</a>'s trade as well.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2477">1720</a>, he was included on a list of freeholders in the city's second ward. 

<p>In July 1738, a "Ryner Myndertse" was commissioned to be the "Resident Agent in the Senekes County" by the provincial governor. By that time, the subject of this sketch no longer appeared on Albany rolls.
 
<p>In January 1758, a "Rynier Myndertse" was buried from the Albany Dutch church. His wife had been buried about two years earlier. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> definitive information on the later life and passing of this Albany resident.</p>
