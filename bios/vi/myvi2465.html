<P><a href="#sources"><b>Myndert Frederickse</b></a> was born during the first decades of the seventeenth century. He emigrated to New Netherland and married Catharina Burger (Burghart) in New Amsterdam in 1656. That marriage was short-lived. 

<p>He re-married in May 1663 to Albany resident <a href="../vv/pivvechten2562.html">Pieterje Teunis Van Vechten</a>. The two marriages produced at least four sons and a daughter who played a large part in establishing the <a href="vi.html">Myndertse</a> or <a href="vi.html">Van Iveren family</a> in colonial New York.</p>

<p>Following his older brother, <a href="cfvi2296.html">Carsten Frederickse</a>, by 1660 Myndert had emerged as a <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#2465">fur trader</a> in Beverwyck, Like his brother, he also worked as a blacksmith. In 1668, he was identified as a "master smith." He owned a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>, a smithy outside the south gate, and a garden and lot as well. In <a href="../../census1679.html#2465">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. In <a href="../../census1697.html#090">1697</a>, three of his grown sons were living in Myndert's Albany home.</p>

<p>He was a member and elder of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> church. He held farmland in Coxsackie and also owned slaves.</p>



<p>Myndert Frederickse filed a <a href="../../wills/willmyfvi.html">will</a> in March 1704. It named his wife, four sons, and his daughter as heirs. His holdings included real and personal property. He died in 1705 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church.</p>
