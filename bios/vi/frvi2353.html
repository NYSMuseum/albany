<strong>Frederick Mynderts Van Iveren</strong></a> probably was born about 1680. He was the youngest son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="myvi2465.html">Myndert Frederickse</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vv/pivvechten2562.html">Pieterje Van Vechten</a> Van Iveren. He grew up at his father's smithy and practiced the blacksmith's trade. At that time, his family was known as "Myndertse."

<p>In 1699, he signed a community-based <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#2353">oath</a> of allegiance to the King of England. In 1704, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willmyfvi.html">will</a> filed by his father. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1706">1706</a>, he was appointed assessor for the third ward. He served as a juror and also appeared before the Albany court as defendant and plaintiff.

<p>In December 1706, Frederick Myndertse married Albany native <a href="../d/sadewan6171.html">Sara De Wandelaer</a> at the Albany <a hef="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1726, ten children had been christened in Albany.

<p>This Mynderts family first lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where his holdings were accorded a moderately substantial <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2353">assessment</a>. He belonged to an Albany <a hreef="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company and was included on a list of first ward freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#2353">1720</a>. In 1716, his house was located outside the city's south gate. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1720">1720</a>, he served as a firemaster in the first ward.

<p>


<p>Frederick Mynderts Van Iveren died in February 1740 and was buried from his church.</p>
