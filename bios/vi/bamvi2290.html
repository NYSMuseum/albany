<strong>Barent Myndertse</strong></a> was a master shoemaker who was <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have been in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> as early as 1659. Perhaps he was a part of the Myndertse <a href="vi.html">-</a> Van Iveren family of New Netherland and New York. He was most often referred to under the patronymic of "Meyndertsen" and its <a href="../../res/sp.html">variants</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#2290">1660</a>, his name appeared on <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#2290a">two</a> competing petitions regarding the fur trade. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#2290">1679</a>, he was counted among Albany's householders. In May 1681, he joined a number of shoemakers in the <a href="http://www.fortunecity.com/millenium/tulip/561/jtvs.html">purchase</a> of a lot located north of the Albany gate. The property along the <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Vosenkill</a> probably was used for <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanning pits</a>.

<p>His wife was Eytie. Their daughter married <a href="../v/pivosburgh.html">Pieter Vosburgh</a> of Kinderhook. In 1683, Barent was a member and supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In that year, he also witnessed a will.

<p>Barent Myndertse was dead by 1689 when Pieter Vosburgh was empowered to administer his estate.</p>
