<P><a href="#sources"><b>Carsten Frederickse</b></a> was born during the early 1600s. He probably came to New Netherland during the 1640s or 50s. He was the older brother of <a href="myvi2465.html">Myndert Frederickse</a>.</p>


<p>By 1660, he had found his way to <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he was identified as one of the <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#2296">principal fur traders</a> in the area. In 1667, he married <a href="cavi6498.html">Catharina Warners</a> (or Warants). Four of their children were alive in 1689. He was a member and deacon of the Albany <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>.</p>

<p>Carsten Frederickse was a blacksmith as well - probably in partnership with Myndert Frederickse. In <a href="../../census1679.html#134">1679</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany householders. A decade earlier, his Albany home <a href="#home">included</a> a chamber, back room, front hall (with a bundle of hay in it), a loft and an attic, a window in the rear gable, a drywell, and a crib in the attic that held forty beavers.</a> 

<p>With his wife, Carsten Frederickse filed a joint will in July 1689. It identified their four surviving children aged nine to twenty. The survivor was made executor of the estate. Carsten died first - within a few years. His widow's Albany household was included on the <a href="../../census1697.html#091">census</a> of 1697.</p>
