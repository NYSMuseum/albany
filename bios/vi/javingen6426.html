      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Van Ingen</strong></a> was born in 
        December 1766. He was the fourth son born to the marriage of Holland-born 
        Dirck Van Ingen and Margarita Van Sise Van Ingen of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>. 
        He grew up as part of a large <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/firstsettlers/vanerde_vans.html">family</a> 
        in a politically active, physician's landmark home on Church Street. His 
        Patriot father <a href="../../or/or-as.html">was</a> a surgeon in the 
        New York Line and treated the sick and wounded during the war as well. 
        His older brother was Albany businessman <a href="wmvingen1188.html">William 
        Van Ingen</a>. 
      <p>James Van Ingen married three times. During the 1780s, he wed Albany 
        native <a href="../b/cableecker160.html">Catharina Bleecker</a> at the 
        Dutch church in Schenectady. She died in April 1798 apparently without 
        bearing children. His second wife was <a href="../s/elschuyler1277.html">Elizabeth 
        Schuyler</a>. Their brief marriage produced one child and ended when she 
        died in February 1801. In February 1802, James married Elizabeth's sister, 
        <a href="../s/geerschuyler1316.html">Gertrude Schuyler</a>, at the Albany 
        <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. Beginning in 
        1800, at least five of his children were christened in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. 
      <p>Occasionally called "Jacob" or "Jacobus," in <a href="../../census1790.html#6426">1790</a>, 
        his <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">upper</a> State Street home included 
        the young couple and two slaves. In 1799, he was living on Pearl Street 
        - in a house next to his <a href="../b/hebleecker186.html">late</a> father-in-law. 
        The next year, the <a href="../../census1800.html#6426">census</a> configured 
        his household of five children and three slaves in a substantial home 
        on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a>. 
      <p>Van Ingen was an <a href="../../trades/law.html">attorney</a>, civic 
        leader, and entrepreneur. In 1811, he represented <a href="../s/esh.html">Elizabeth 
        Schuyler</a> Hamilton in transactions regarding her South End property. 
      <p>Beginning in 1792, he served as clerk of the newly formed <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank 
        of Albany</a>. Also that year, he was a trustee and the first treasurer 
        and librarian of the new community institution known as the "Albany Library." 
        He served as clerk of the Albany bank until he was named clerk of the 
        New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>. He served in 
        a number of municipal offices (alderman and assessor) and was active in 
        community-based organizations including the Albany Water Works. 
      <p>As his late brother was a skipper, James Van Ingen came to be the owner 
        of steamboats plying the river out of Albany. In that context, he was 
        involved in litigation with Robert Fulton. 
      <p>In 1813, the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> identified 
        him as the "clerk in chancery" with a residence at 14 <a href="../../streets.html#montgomery">Montgomery 
        Street</a>. After a couple years, his addresses changed several times 
        - finally settling him at 250 North Market Street at the corner of Colonie 
        Street. 
      <p>The <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/ny/schenectady/wills/va/vaningen-dirk.txt">will</a> 
        of his father, probated in May 1814, named him co-executor and bestowed 
        on him a substantial financial bequest and other considerations. 
      <p>James Van Ingen died in February 1843 at the age of seventy-six.</p>

        <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of James Van Ingen 
        is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 6426. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> 
        is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. 
        <p>Portraits: Van Ingen was a client of Albany artist and painter <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra 
          Ames</a>. In 1811, he was <a href="../../books.html#eaa">charged</a> 
          for artwork related to his steamboats. He also may have commissioned 
          a painting of the city seal with the motto "Assiduity" that has been 
          in the collection of the <a href="http://albanyinstitute.org/">Albany 
          Institute of History and Art</a>. In 1813, he organized the Albany-based initiative 
          that led to Ames producing now-famous paintings of George Washington 
          and Governor George Clinton. In September 1815, James Van Ingen, Esq. 
          was charged $30 for a protrait and frame of his son.
