<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Marte Myndertse</strong></a> Van Iveren was born in April 1727. He was the son of Albany residents Frederick and Sara De Wandelaer Van Iveren. He was known as "Martin Mindertse" or "Marte Mynders."
 
<p>In November 1751, he married <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> native <a href="../r/saryckman1990.html">Sara Ryckman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1767, four children had been christened in Albany.

<p>Like many men of his <a href="vi.html">family</a>, Marte Myndertse was a <a href="../../census1756.html#209">blacksmith</a>. He also was a first ward <a href="../../census1790.html#2461">mainstay</a> for forty years. His <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> home on <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a> received a moderate assessment. He served as a firemaster, constable, chimney viewer, and in 1760, he was elected assistant alderman for the first ward. He was a contractor of the city and made metal fittings for docks and bridges  He also owned a lot on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows hill</a>.

<p>At the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he joined the crusade for American liberties and represented the first ward on the <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. He helped collect money for the relief of Boston. In 1778, he was fifty-one-years-old and was chosen lieutenant in a company of <a href="../../or/or-as.html">older patriots</a> called "Associated Exempts." A dozen of them formed his company of blacksmiths <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#2461">under</a> the Quartermaster General. 

<p>In 1785, he was elected overseer of the <a href="../../poor.html">poor</a> and chimney viewer for the first ward. Throughout his adult life, he was called on to witness legal documents and to subscribe to community-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#petition">petitions</a>.

<p>Marte Myndertse lost his wife in February 1791. By <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, his name no longer appeared on the first ward census of heads of households.  He died in April 1806. His obituary called him "a worthy and respectable inhabitant." He was just past his seventy-ninth birthday.
