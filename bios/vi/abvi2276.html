<strong>Abraham Myndertse</strong></a> was christened on April 1, 1722. He was the son of Frederick and Sara De Wandelaer Van Iveren. He was known under the patronymic "Myndertse" but belonged to the <a href="vi.html">Van Iveren</a> family.

<p>In October 1755, he was thirty-three when he married Catharina Ostrander at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She died less than eight months later. In October 1760, he married Catharina Lansing. However, she died in July 1764 - leaving Abraham with only two children from both marriages.

<p>Abraham Myndertse was a tailor who <a href="../../census1790.html#2276">lived alone</a> with one servant in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. From <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1763fl">1763</a> on, he was somewhat of an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2276">mainstay</a> - although he held no civic offices was not involved with the city government as a contractor.

<p>In his fifties at the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">outbreak</a> of hostilities in 1775, he dows not appear to have been directly involved in Revolutionary activities. He did, however, recieve a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2276">land bounty right</a> afterward.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house and lot were valued on the first ward assessment. After that, his name no longer appeared on Albany rolls. 

<p>Abraham Myndertse Van Iveren was dead by February 1805 when his will passed probate.</p>
