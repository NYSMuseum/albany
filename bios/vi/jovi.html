<strong>Johannes Van Iveren</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s. He was the son of <a href="myvi2465.html">Myndert Frederickse</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vv/pivvechten2562.html">Pieterje Van Vechten</a> Van Iveren.  He grew up in a large combined family in the third ward home of a prominent blacksmith and sometime fur trader. In <a href="../../census1697.html#090">1697</a> he wa accounted for in the household of his father. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#jovi">1699</a>,  he signed a commmunity-based document swearing allegiance to the king of England.

<p> In 1704, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willmyfvi.html">will</a> filed by his father.
By that time, he had left home and settled in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>.  He was a smith, "armorer at the fort," and <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of Schenectady freeholders. During the 1720s, he was in trouble with the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">court</a> for illegal fur trading. However, in 1723, he found satisfaction at the New York Supreme Court - where he was vindicated. He is credited with establishing Schenectady's right to trade - thus breaking Albany's mandated monopoly on the activity.

<p>His wife was Geertruy Van Slyck - the mother of at least four children. Like his father, he was a <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran</a> but relied on the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> for services. 


<p>Johannes Van Iveren filed a will in May 1754. It described his Schenectady property which included a smithy and bolting house. The will passed probate in September 1757.</p>
