<P>Referred to variously, this <a href="#sources"> <strong>Frederic Myndertse</strong></a> (<a href="vi.html">Van Iveren</a> but <a href="../../res/sp.html">kn</a>own in Albany more as "Mynderse") was born in August 1743. He was the son of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents Andries and Anna Elizabeth Smith. He was named for his grandfather, Albany resident <a href="frvi2353.html">Frederic Van Iveren</a> who died in 1740.

<p>In April 1765, he married Albany native <a href="../w/elwaldron653.html">Elizabeth Waldron</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. By 1791, eleven children had been christened in Albany. Even without immediate community-based connections, these christenings suggest that Frederic or his wife was more closely connected to the Albany church as opposed to sister parishes in his native Schenectady or elsewhere in Albany County.

<p>This Frederic Myndertse appears to have been an Albany resident dating at least to <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a> as his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> property was valued minimally. However, other contemporary Frederics also were raising families in the region.  

<p>In his early thirties at the outbreak of hostilities, unlike other members of his family, his name has not been found on the rolls of Albany's Revolutionary wartime <a href="../../coc.html">agencies</a>. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2354">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In October <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a>, his Albany holdings were valued modestly. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2354">1788</a>, his house and lot in the first ward were accorded modest assessments. However, the only viable "Frederic <a href="../../res/sp.html">Mindersee</a>" appearing on the census in <a href="../../census1790.html#2354">1790</a> was listed south of Albany in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet. That individual appears to have been the same Frederick Mynderse who <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">leased a farm</a> on the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> after 1791.

<p>In March <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html#2354">1793</a>, he owed the estate of the late butcher William Charles a little more than three pounds.

<p>But in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and modest holdings were valued on the first ward assessment roll probably at the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside location where he would live for two or three decades and where the census in <a href="../../census1800.html#2354">1800</a> and in 1810 configured his household. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=%22mynderse+frederick%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22mynderse%20frederick%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>  listed him at 38 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a> and his son next door at 40 Hudson.

<p>Frederic Myndertse probably was dead by 1814 when his widow first was named as the householder on Hudson Street.</p>
