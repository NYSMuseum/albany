<strong>William Van Ingen</strong></a> was born in November 1760. He was the son of Dirck Van Ingen and his first wife,  Margaret Van <a href="../../res/sp.html">Si</a>ce Van Ingen. His father was a prominent physician who came from Rotterdam in Holland to settle in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and become a Revolutionary stalwart and public offficial. William was the older brother of Albany attorney <a href="javingen6426.html">James Van Ingen</a>.

<p>He was but fifteen at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">ho</a>stilities in 1775. However, he probably was "Mr. Van Ingen, a young gentleman who is my clerk," mentioned by <a href="../g/heglen4923.html">Henry Glen</a> in a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hGosAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA341&lpg=PA341&dq=%22van+ingen%22+albany&source=web&ots=9z-oHE7MK4&sig=M_YvQuQCNShyor6GUqiokDRxSI4">letter</a> dated Schenectady, October 26, 1781. Glen was William Van Ingen's future father-in-law and had both Albany and Schenectady residences. An earlier letter to Glen referred to him as "Billy Van Ingen."

<p>During the 1770s, young had William attended Princeton but did not graduate. However, his interest in education came forward later as he was involved in the founding of Union College and the establishment of the Albany library. 

<p>By 1784, he had married <a href="../g/elglen1178.html">Elizabeth Glen</a> - eldest daughter of a Schenectady <a href="../g/heglen4923.html">leader</a> and sometime Albany resident. The marriage produced only one <a href="hegvingen.html">son</a>. William was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In September 1781, he witnessed the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA579&lpg=PA579&dq=%22elizabeth+van+ingen%22&source=web&ots=4QFj2zgRWU&sig=MsLhoyQEL00zbXqYoWPBHURcIMc#PPA81,M1">will</a> of a Schenectady neighbor.

<p>This young Van Ingen family made its <a href="../../census1790.html#1188">home</a> in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where William was known as a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA260&lpg=PA260&dq=%22william+van+ingen%22+will+albany&source=bl&ots=ksu9fI-IvR&sig=2zTTo45z7LdUEH2Vnfqsz94n0WY&hl=en&ei=JH_GToCNKMb30gGouv0U&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">skipper</a> and businessman - sometimes in partnership with the <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#shipingen">Shipboys</a> and the <a href="../c/jacaldwell7509.html">Caldwells</a>. Assessment <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1188">rolls</a> show his Albany holdings to be of moderate value.

<p>William Van Ingen  filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmvingen.html">will</a> in December 1799. It left everything to his wife and son. He died in January 1800 and was buried from the Albany church. His <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/cemeteries/luckhurst.html">tombstone</a> is part of a family plot in Schenectady. He had lived less than forty years.</p>
