<P><a href="#sources"><b>Neeltjie Mynderts</b></a> was born during the mid-1660s. She was the daughter of New Netherland pioneers <a href="myvi2465.html">Myndert Frederickse</a> and <a  href="../vv/pivvechten2562.html">Pieterje Van Vechten</a> Van Iveren.</p>



<p>In January 1686, she married widower <a href="../vb/mgvb6656.html">Marte Gerritse Van Bergen</a>. That marriage produced six children before Marte Gerritse's death in 1696. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#2340">1697</a>, she was identified as the head of a Rensselaerswyck household consisting of a woman and five children. In that year, she wed <a href="../d/hedouw2083.html">Hendrick Douw</a> - probably several years her junior. Their six children were baptized in the Albany Dutch church as well.

<p>This Douw family lived in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> but also owned houses and other property in Albany.

<p>In 1704, she and her daughter were named as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willmyfvi.html">will</a> filed by her father.

<p>She was lightly provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willhedouw.html">will</a> filed by Hendrick Douw in 1749. Neeltje lost her second husband in 1751. Cornelia Mynderts Van Bergen Douw died in February 1758 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church.</p>
