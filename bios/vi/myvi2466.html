      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Myndert Van Iveren</strong></a> was born 
        in April 1700. He was the first child born to the marriage of Albany residents 
        <a href="ryvi2477.html">Rynier Mynderts</a> and <a href="../b/sabradt4360.html">Sara 
        Bradt</a> Van Iveren. He grew up in a smith's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a>. 
      <p>In December 1721, he married eighteen-year-old <a href="../w/arwyn6200.html">Ariaantie 
        Wyngaert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        A few months later, the first of their six children was christened in 
        Albany where both parents were pewholders. 
<p>Like many family members, this Myndert Van Iveren was a blacksmith. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#2466">1742</a>, he was identified as a freeholder living in the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1727">1727</a>, he was appointed firemaster. In <a href="../../census1756.html#150">1756</a>, his home was configured on a census of households in the city of Albany.

<p>Myndert Van Iveren stated that he was "unhealthy" in September 1760 when he filed a <a href="../../wills/willmyvi2466.html">will</a>. It named his wife and children as beneficiaries. He probably died shortly thereafter. The will passed probate in 1773.</p>
