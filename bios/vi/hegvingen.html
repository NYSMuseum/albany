<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Henry Glen Van Ingen</strong></a> was born 
        in May of 1784. He was the only son born to the marriage of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Sch</a>enectady 
        natives <a href="wmvingen1188.html">William</a> and <a href="../g/elglen1178.html">Elizabeth 
        Glen</a> Van Ingen. He was named for his mother's <a href="../g/heglen4923.html">father</a>. 
      <p>Perhaps Henry had a younger sister. After a time in Schenectady, he grew up in the home of a <a href="../../census1790.html#1188">mainline</a> 
        Albany businessman and skipper. 
      <p>Henry and his mother were named as direct heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willwmvingen.html">will</a> 
        filed by his father in December 1799. William Van Ingen was dead by February 
        1800 when the will passed probate. 
      <p>In 1807, Henry Glen Van Ingen was appointed ensign in <a href="../t/matrotter4914.html">Matthew 
        Trotter's</a> regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. 
        Beyond that reference, his name has not been found on the rolls of the 
        mainline Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">community</a>. 
      <p>Instead, it appears that young Van Ingen moved west following the death 
        of his father. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources place 
        him in the Mohawk Valley by 1802 when he was <a href="http://threerivershms.com/simmsflax.htm">serving</a> 
        as a clerk in the business of a cloth merchant. He is said to have briefly 
        studied medicine in Fort Plain. Afterwards, he purchased <a href="http://www.schist.org/library/deeds/DeedFile.htm">property</a> 
        on Washington Street and settled in Schenectady. 
      <p>He married in Schenectady in January 1804. His wife was Schenectady resident <a href="http://users.ap.net/~lancelot/gen/h234.html">Elizabeth 
        Hoople</a> who <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/cemeteries/luckhurst.html">died</a> 
        in November 1849. The marriage produced at least three children who were 
        christened at the Episcopal church in Schenectady. 
      <p>Henry Glen Van Ingen died some time before 1841 when the widow Elizabeth 
        Van Ingen was living at 19 Green Street in Schenectady.</p>
