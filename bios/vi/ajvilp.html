<P><a href="#sources"><b>Adrian Janse Van Ilpendam</b></a> was a notary in Albany during the third quarter of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>He probably was born about 1611. His background is puzzling and raises more questions for us than anything else!</p>


<p>He was a schoolteacher and sometime <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. He was living in the community when houselots were allocated in 1656. However, his name did not appear on either of the fairly comprehensive <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">lists of fur traders</a> compiled in 1660. In 1657, he appears to have purchased a brickyard.</p>


<p>In 1669, he was appointed notary by the Albany court. At that time, he gave his age as  fifty-one. </p>


<p>His wife was named <a href="#wife">Tryntje Jans</a>. The couple had no children.  He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
<p>In 1679, his name appeared on an Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#6424">census of householders</a>. In 1681, he was identified as an Albany burgher. His house was located on the <a href="../../streets.html#market">main street</a> that ran parallel to the river.</p>

<p>Adrian Janse Van Ilpendam committed suicide by hanging himself in 1685. His life is the subject of an unparalleled portrait by Donna Merwick recently published under the title of <a href="../../books.html#don"><i>Death of a Notary</i></a>.

<p>In 1701, former coroner <a href="../vkl/jvloon2399.html">Jan Van Loon</a> was summoned to surrender Van Ilpendam's papers - which he apparently held for twenty-five years.</p>
