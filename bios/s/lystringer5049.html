<P><a href="#sources"><b>Lydia Stringer</b></a> was born in 1759. She was the first child born to Dr. <a href="sastringer5046.html">Samuel Stringer</a> and his wife, the former <a href="../vd/ravdh5712.html">Rachel Vanderheyden</a>.</p>


<p>In December 1781, she married newcomer, Revolutionary officer, and secretary to the governor  <a href="../l/stlush416.html">Stephen Lush</a> at the home of the Dutch dominie in Schenectady. By 1800, the marriage had produced at least eight children.</p>

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#416">1790</a>, her family had settled permanently in a large new home on <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market Street</a> which they shared with her parents - who lived in the other half of the double house.</p>
 
<p>Lydia lost her husband in 1825. She was <a href="../../wills/willstlush.html">named</a> executor of his substantial estate which she administered for many years. She continued to live in their home at 313 North Market Street. Lydia Stringer Lush died in August 1841 at age 83. In that year, she was identified as the owner of two houses on the west side of Market Street - a grand three-story brick building and a two-story wooden structure. Letters of administration were issued on her estate in October.</p>
