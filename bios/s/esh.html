<P><a href="#sources"><b>Elizabeth Schuyler</b></a> was born in August 1757. She was the second daughter in the large family of Albany leader <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a>, and his wife <a href="../vr/cavr.html">Catherine Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler. She grew up mostly at her father's grand new <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">mansion</a> and at their summer home at Old Saratoga.</p>

<p><a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/eshearl1787.jpg" align=left border=1 vspace=1 hspace=4 width=200 height=240 alt="young Elizabeth"></a>She 
        was introduced to Alexander Hamilton when he visited her father at <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler 
        Mansion</a> in October 1777. Following an ardent courtship, they were married 
        in the front parlor there in December 1780. By 1802, the marriage had 
        produced eight children - although only the first son (Philip Hamilton) would be christened in Albany.</p>
		
<p>Over the next quarter-century, these Hamiltons lived in Philadelphia and in New York where Hamilton had developed an estate in Harlem called "The Grange." As Hamilton's career developed, he spent less and less time in Albany. However, Elizabeth often brought her family home to Albany in the summer to be with the Schuylers.</p>

<p>Tragedy struck when Hamilton was shot and killed by <a href="../b/aaburr.html">Aaron Burr</a> in a duel in July 1804. Philip Schuyler died a few months later. Widowed at forty-seven, Elizabeth <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1750.html">inherited</a> a substantial part of her father's large estate including land near <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a> which then was sold to newcomers and other first-time property owners. Several lots along South Pearl Street were purchased by free blacks and formed the core of the first <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro Albanian</a> community in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a>.</p>

<p>After living many years as a widow in New York, Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton 
        spent the final years of her life in Washington, DC in the household of 
        her daughter. She died in November 1854 at the age of ninety-seven.</p>
