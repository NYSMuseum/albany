<P>Albany innkeeper <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jared Skinner</strong></a> was born between 1756 and 1766. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. At that time, we can only <a href="../../res/guess.html">gu</a>ess that he was of <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> background.

<p>His wife was one <a href="../d/madrew.html">Mary Drew</a>. Their daughter was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in July 1798. 

<p>Beginning in April <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, Albany jury lists identified him as an innkeeper. In 1801, he paid $18 for a tavern license. As late as September 1803, he was identified as a freeholder and an innkeeper.

<p>In January 1800, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjoostjr.html">will</a> of a neighbor. In <a href="../../census1800.html#jask">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household counted twelve residents including five girls ten or younger. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, seventeen individuals were living under his roof.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PXw4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29&dq=%22jared+skinner%22+albany&source=bl&ots=eQz0nMj_uX&sig=RSS31kEQe568hu6U9JLtxzMOiUk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=yrCPUc6ZHaS6iwKN-IGoBg&ved=0CE8Q6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&q=%22jared%20skinner%22%20albany&f=false">1801</a>, he was listed among the original petitioners for the incorporation of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. However, his name does not appear on its cumulative membership list.


<p>From the beginning of the century, Skinner was a visible downtown mainliner. In June 1802, the Albany <a href="http://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/p320/mode/2up/search/skinner">paper noted</a> that he purchased a record fifty-five pound [striped] bass for $4.50.

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Irish_Patriotism.html?id=iM09uAAACAAJ">1810</a>, Albany Republicans met in his "long room" on Green Street. In December, a meeting was held at Skinner's by those interested in forming a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LHdKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%22jared+skinner%22+albany&source=bl&ots=OesVnnhsjJ&sig=AbjLTb8gCy7nJAoPhMxAGNZTDgw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2K2PUe-RF8eJiAK3v4CoCA&ved=0CDIQ6AEwATge#v=onepage&q=%22jared%20skinner%22%20albany&f=false">play-house</a> in Albany. During the early 1800s, a <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22jared+skinner%22+innkeeper&oq=%22jared+skinner%22+innkeeper&gs_l=hp.3...13751.19028.1.19282.11.11.0.0.0.0.245.1972.0j9j2.11.0...0.0...1c.1.12.psy-ab.7yECET642X4&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.46340616,d.cGE&fp=ba570a5a6601e4a3&biw=1382&bih=559">number of organizations</a> met at his establishment.


<p>Jared Skinner was dead by February 1813 when his will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a>. The first city directory issued a few months later <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22skinner+widow%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22skinner%20widow%22&f=false">listed</a> his widow as an innkeeper at 159 Court Street. It was one of seven  Skinner-named addresses included in the city wide listing.</p>
