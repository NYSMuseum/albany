<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Catherine Sanders</strong></a> was born in February 1752. She was the daughter of Albany mayor <a href="rosanders1443.html">Robert Sanders</a> and his second wife, <a href="elschuyler1274.html">Elizabeth Schuyler</a> Sanders. Her mother died in 1763 and her father passed two years later. She was accorded a share of his substantial estate in <a href="../../wills/willrosanders1443.html">1765</a>.

<p>In June 1770, Catherine was eighteen when she married a somewhat older <a href="../t/hete4876.html">Hendrick Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their only child was born in July 1771.

<p>However, Catherine Sanders Ten Eyck was dead when her son was christened on July 28, 1771. She probably died following his birth. The infant died shortly thereafter.</p>
