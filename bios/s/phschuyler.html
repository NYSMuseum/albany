<P><a href="#sources"><b>Phillipus Schuyler</b></a> was born in January 1696. He was the son of <a href="pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a> and his second wife, Maria Van Rensselaer Schuyler.</p>

<p>He may have begun what became a lifelong military attachment as a member of his uncle's <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">militia troop</a> in 1715.</p>

<p>In December 1720, he married his cousin, nineteen-year-old 
<a href="mgtschuyler.html">Margarita Schuyler</a> - the daughter of his father's brother. The marriage was childless but both partners were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where they were occasional baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>This younger son of the first mayor of Albany was called "<a href="#militia">Colonel</a>" and lived with his wife on the family farm at <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">the Flats</a>. Although living beyond the city limits, he represented Albany in the provincial Assembly from 1728 to 1747 and again in 1750-51. On a number of occasions, he spent time in the Indian country. Anne Grant later thought him responsible for "<a href="../../art/grant2.html#indian">management</a>" of the Indians. </p>

<p>Much of the rich detail of "the Colonel's" married life has been related in Anne Grant' s <a href="../../art/grant.html"><i>Memoirs of an American Lady</i>.</a>

<p>Phillipus Schuyler filed a <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler104.html">will</a> in June 1748. It mentioned Margarita, his siblings, and their children. He died in February 1758 at the age of sixty-two.</p>
