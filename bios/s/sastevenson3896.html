<P><a href="#sources"><b>Sarah Stevenson</b></a> was born in December 1736. She was the daughter of <a href="jastevenson3901.html">James</a> and <a href="../g/sagrdyck.html">Sara Groenendyck</a> Stevenson. 

<p>She was the wife of career British army officer <a href="../c/gachristie.html">Gabriel Christie</a> who was stationed in Albany during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. Their son, Napier was baptized in the Albany Dutch church in September 1758. The marriage may have produced additional children. </p>


<p>In 1763, she was named in her father's <a href="../../wills/willjastevenson.html">will</a>. She was left only a "negro wench" in that she already had received her share of Stevenson's estate.</p> 

<p>Christie was able to establish a settlement at Isle Aux Noix on the Richilieu River which flowed into the St. Lawrence. However, he travelled extensively. Whether Sarah accompanied him is <a href="../../inprog.html">open to investigation</a>! Perhaps she lived some with her <a href="../../census1790.html#2244">brother</a>, a prominent Albany merchant!</p>

<p>Gabriel Christie died in Montreal in November 1798. Sarah Stevenson Christie may have died in 1801!</p>
