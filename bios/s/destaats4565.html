<P><a href="#sources"><b>Debora Staats</b></a> was born during the 1670s. She was the daughter of Albany surgeon <a href="jastaats4595.html">Jacob Staats</a> and his first wife, Ryckie, who died in 1709. Jacob Staats re-married when Debora was in her thirties.</p>


<p>In November 1694, Debora Staats married <a href="../r/heroseboom1655.html">Hendrick Roseboom, Jr</a>. By 1715, seven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member and occasional baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>Roseboom was a fur trader and city official who settled his family into a <a href="../../census1697.html#148">house</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> near "Roseboom's gate." They were community mainstays for several decades.</p>

<p>In 1734, she was left a substantial <a href="../../wills/willjastaats.html">share</a> of her father's estate.</p>

<p>Hendrick Roseboom, Jr. probably died before his wife. Debora Staats Roseboom was buried from the Dutch church in early October 1749.</p>
