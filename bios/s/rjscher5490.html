<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ryer Jacobse</b></a> was born in February 1652. He was the eldest son in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="jajscher5448.html">Jacob Janse</a> and <a href="../vv/javvoor7001.html">Jannetie Segers</a> Schermerhorn. He grew up in a <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> home and then in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> where his father owned property as well.</p>


<p>About 1676, he married <a href="../b/arbradt5454.html">Ariaantie Bradt</a> - the widow of Helmer Otten. The union produced a number of children who settled in Schenectady and its hinterland. Although he was identified as an Albany householder in <a href="../../census1679.html#5490">1679</a>, he settled permanently in Schenectady and expanded on the land he had obtained through his marriage and from his father. He built a fortune in <a href="../../econ/comec.html">trade</a> - most notably in the shipping of timber for use in ship building. In <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">1684</a>, he owed back taxes in Albany.</p>

      <p>During the 1680s, he emerged as a leader of a younger group that vied for power 
        with the original Schenectady patentees. He sought acceptance at the provincial 
        level and leapt over all other Schenectadians when he was appointed to 
        the first New York <a href="../../org/ass.html">General Assembly</a> established 
        by Governor <a href="../d/thdongan.html">Thomas Dongan</a> in 1683. The 
        honor was short-lived as that Assembly met for only a few weeks!</p>

<p>Ryer Schermerhorn became the sole trustee of the Schenectady Patent issued in 1684. He may have held that title until 1714.

<p>In May 1688, "Eldest Sonne" Ryer was <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">bequeathed</a> a lot "along the River" in Albany - probably once the property of his mother's family. 

      <p>In 1689, he sided with the government proposed by the insurgent Jacob Leisler 
        and was appointed a justice. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 border=1 alt="In-progress; read Mohawk Frontier!"></a> 
        He was elected to the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> 
        in 1693, 1694, 1698, 1699, and 1701. During that time, it appears he made 
        his home in Albany where he also served as a magistrate.</p>




      <p>In June <a href="../../census1697.html#105">1697</a>, his house was listed 
        on the Albany census and included his wife and children. His brother, 
        Cornelis, lived next door. Shortly thereafter, he returned to Schenectady 
        and reestablished himself in the rebuilding community. 
      <p>Ryer Schermerhorn had filed a joint will with his wife in 1678 - an uncharacteristic act for a young man but perhaps prompted by the presence of his wife's children and other potential heirs. He filed <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/schermerhorn/chronicles/2a.html#3">new will document</a> in April 1717. It mentioned no Albany property but more extensive holdings in Schenectady and its hinterland. He died in February 1719.</p>

<p>Ryer Jacobse Schermerhorn is a legendary figure in the history of the early years of the Schenectady community. Anecdotes and traditions abound in most of the "<a href="../../res/ts.html">popular</a>" histories! A small part of his life had an Albany city <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>. This page strives to focus on his early Albany life!</p>

        <a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of Ryer Jacobse Schermerhorn 
        is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 5490. This profile 
        is derived chiefly from <a href="schermerhorn.html#sources">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Tom Burke's 
        <a href="../../books.html#burke"><i>Mohawk Frontier</i></a> is somewhat 
        biographical as it places Ryer in the center of Schenctady's development 
        and subsequent rebirth after 1700.</font></p>
