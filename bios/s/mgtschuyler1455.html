        <P><B>Margarita Schuyler</B> was born in Albany in January 1672, the last 
          of the twelve children of <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse</a> 
          and <a href="../vs/mvslicht.html">Margarita Van Slichenhorst</a> Schuyler. 
          Although her father died when she was nine, Margarita grew up in her 
          mother's <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">landmark home</a> surrounded 
          by an already large and prominent early Albany family.</p>
        <p>The Schuyler family's status permitted even its youngest child to marry 
          well. In 1691, <a href="#child">nineteen-year-old</a> Margarita wed 
          Jacobus Verplanck - son of a downriver commerical family. The union 
          would enable her New York-born husband to begin trading in Albany. But 
          before the couple could establish themselves in Albany, Jacobus Verplanck 
          died - leaving Margarita with two New York-born children. So in 1699, 
          Margarita and her family returned to Albany to live with her widowed 
          mother.</p>
        <p>In November 1701, the twenty-nine-year-old widow married <a href="../c/jcollins.html">John 
          Collins</a> - an officer in the Albany garrison. That union gave a talented 
          <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> an opening that helped him 
          become a leading businessman and Albany's first professional attorney. 
          The marriage also produced three children including <a href="../c/ecollins.html">Edward 
          Collins</a> - but no grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Margarita Collins raised her family and lived an advantaged Albany 
          life until the death of her second husband in 1728. After that, she 
          returned to the Schuyler family umbrella. She died in May 1748 at age 
          76 and was buried beneath the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
          church</a>.</p>

        <P><A name=child></a>Most Albany women <a href="../../marriages.html">married</a> 
          during their early twenties. Margarita's early nuptual may be explained 
          by the reported baptism of Jacobus Verplanck's child on April 13, 1690. 
          No mother was named in the record - as often was the custom at that 
          time. For Margarita and the Schuyler family, see <a href="schuyler.html#sources">Schuyler 
          Genealogy</a>, pp. 24-25.</P>
