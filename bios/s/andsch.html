<P>Based on a <a href="http://www.adkins9.net/individual.php?pid=I3274">compilation</a> of <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional resources, this <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer known as <a href="#sources"> <strong>Andries Hanse</strong></a> was born in Europe (perhaps in Sweden) about 1640. He is said to have emigrated to New Amsterdam in 1660. However, we seek more verifiable information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and his path to the settlement that became Albany in 1664.

<p>In his <a href="../../albanycounty.html">greater</a> Albany <a href="../../res/context.html">context</a>, he also was known by the surname "<a href="../../res/sp.html">Scherp</a>." At this point, we cannot say that he is the patriarch of the early Albany family known as <a href="sharp.html">Sharp</a>.

<p>According to traditional sources, he was in Beverwyck as early as 1660; was the father of three sons, and, in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA483&lpg=PA483&dq=andries+hanse&source=bl&ots=-_tcC_JV9r&sig=UG4Cf1h7U0bAxVoxC_6d59xqu28&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tusjVfzVCKHIsQTw14LgBw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwCjgU#v=onepage&q=andries%20hanse&f=false">1671</a>, bought a farm "behind" <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>." This individual appears to have been among the early <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=GIY-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22andries+hanse+scherp%22&source=bl&ots=S98aT5kyTj&sig=DhTTnO-1XxPrSLOreirUS2iDEv4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5tAjVdiZLrDasAT7hYHgBw&ved=0CEIQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=%22andries%20hanse%20scherp%22&f=false">settlers</a> of Kinderhook. As late as <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/kind/kinderhook_%201744_tax_list.htm">1744</a>, an assessment roll identifies six Scherps as Kinderhook property holders. However, the existence of several <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=rHJWAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22andries+hanse+scherp%22&source=bl&ots=2XVB43PzsY&sig=fOh0cdMp6_Tc8xJBx5Bv1H24mfs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5tAjVdiZLrDasAT7hYHgBw&ved=0CB0Q6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=%22andries%20hanse%20scherp%22&f=false">same-named</a> contemporaries dating from the seventeenth century dictates caution in the assignment of qualitative information.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#rw">1697</a>, the households of <a href="../../census1697.html#anha">two</a> similarly named <a href="../../census1697.html#anja">individuals</a> were configured on the provincial census of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck. Perhaps one of them was the subject of this sketch.

<p>This individual known as Andries Hanse (Scherp) may have died in <a href="http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Andries-Hanse_Scherp_(1)">New Jersey</a> in 1701.

<p>We began following the name "Andries Scherp" to ascertain a possible relationship to the Albany <a href="sharp.html">Sharp</a> family. At this point, we have been unable to sustain that connection. Without substantial evidence to tie this individual to that family or to the early history of the city of Albany, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move-on</a> for now.</p>
