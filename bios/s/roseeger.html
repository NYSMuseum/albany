<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Roeloff Seeger</strong></a> was born in August 1727. He was the fourth son of <a href="joseeger7002.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../w/brwheel.html">Bridget Wheeler</a> Seeger. He grew up in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home of a career city retainer as a member of a large family that included several future Albany residents. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1750">1750</a>, and again in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1760">1760</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Beyond those appointments, he appears to have been far less connected to the city government than his father or his slightly older <a href="thseeger.html">brother</a>. 

<p>By 1751, he had married Margarita Arnold. She died following the birth of their first child in 1752. In February 1754, widower Roeloff married "<a href="../../res/sp.html">L</a>ydia Harty" at the Albany 
<a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1767, three children had been christened in the church where, over the next decade, the parents were frequent baptism sponsors.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1766</a>, his property was valued minimally by the city assessor. A same-named individual also held a lot at Catskill at that time.

<p>Roeloff Seeger was last heard from in February <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA234&lpg=PA234&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false">1772</a> when the city treasurer paid his account for 18 pounds and 15 shillings.

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Albany resident <a href="../../res/sp.html">Roeloff</a> Seeger. However, a genealogical <a href="http://genealogy.julie-h.com/getperson.php?personID=P380795380&tree=batesonly">source</a> had this Albany native dying in Ontario, Canada in 1787.</p>
