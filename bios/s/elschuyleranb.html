<p><a href="esh.html">Hamilton, Elizabeth Schuyler</a> (9 Aug. 1757-9 Nov. 1854),  statesman's 
wife and charity worker, was born in Albany, New York, the second
daughter of Philip Schuyler, a revolutionary war general, and
Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler. Schooled at home, her early
years were typical of most young women of colonial, aristocratic
families. At the age of twenty-two, she met Alexander Hamilton,
a dashing aide-de-camp of General George Washington, at the home
of Gertrude Cochran, her aunt, wife of <a href="../c/jocochran.html">John Cochran</a>. For Elizabeth
it was love at first sight, a love that remained strong through
the many scandals ahead. Accepted into the Schuyler family despite
his illegitimate birth and lack of wealth or social standing,
Alexander Hamilton held political beliefs similar to those of
his future father-in-law. Both supported a strong centralized
government and General Washington. Both had been soldiers as
well as members of his military staff. The entire Schuyler family
revered Alexander as a young political genius. As for Alexander,
it is possible that he considered marrying Elizabeth for her
family's money and status, for the Schuylers were one of the
most influential families in the state of New York. Yet, his
true love seemed evident in their courtship correspondence, which
was intimate and childlike. Believing his sincerity, Elizabeth,
with no formal education, became interested in military and political
affairs, and Alexander even discussed Benedict Arnold's treason
with her. In many of his letters Alexander also expressed his
worry about his poverty and ability to provide for his future
wife. The pair were finally married on 14 December, 1780; he
was just shy of the age of twenty-four, and she was twenty-three.  

<p>The Hamiltons' marriage was both blessed with many children
and fraught with scandal and credit problems. Elizabeth bore
eight children between the years 1782 and 1802, miscarrying at
least once. Ironically, her eldest son Philip, aged nineteen,
was killed in a duel by an associate of Aaron Burr. After Philip's
untimely death, her eldest daughter, Angelica, named after Elizabeth's
sister, went insane. Six months later, Elizabeth bore her last
child, also naming him Philip. Alexander adored children, both
his own and Fanny Antil, a daughter of a fellow revolutionary
war veteran, whom Alexander adopted. Elizabeth's frequent pregnancies
often prevented her attendance at social functions at which Alexander
was accompanied often by Elizabeth's eldest sister, Angelica.
Both of the Hamiltons adored Angelica, but Alexander's affection
appeared to exceed mere brotherly sentiment. It is unclear if
this attraction actually turned into an affair. Alexander believed
that his marriage vows to Elizabeth were unbreakable promises,
but between 1791 and 1792 Alexander did have an affair with Maria
Reynolds. Elizabeth and the children spent summers in Albany,
New York, away from the disease-ridden summers of urban Philadelphia,
leaving Hamilton alone. Maria claimed to be an abandoned relative
of several prominent New York families, and Hamilton's pity for
her plight resulted in a liaison. Probably entrapped by Reynolds's
husband, James, Alexander publicly confessed the affair by publishing
his personal account. Elizabeth forgave him; if she had not,
his career and reputation would have been irrevocably ruined.  

<p>Despite Alexander's actual and rumored affairs, the Hamiltons'
personal relationship was one of mutual respect. Elizabeth accepted
his flirtatiousness. Alexander continued to solicit her advice
on political and family matters, as he had early in their courtship.
Before their marriage, he had trusted his wife to negotiate the
purchase of a house. Throughout their married life, he often
read selections of his writings to her, seeking her opinion and
approval. She listened to his early drafts of Washington's "Farewell
Address" and excerpts from the Federalist Papers. She probably
copied some of the Federalist Papers for Alexander to distribute.  

<p>Never idyllic, the Hamiltons' marriage was hampered by incessant
credit problems. Alexander resigned from military service and
qualified for the bar in 1782. From 1789 to 1795, he worked for
the fledgling American government as the first secretary of the
treasury and as a member of President Washington's cabinet. He
resigned in 1795 and returned to his New York City law practice.
The Hamiltons struggled financially, never accepting assistance
from General Schuyler, with the exception of food and goods from
Schuyler's estate. With credit already stretched, Alexander bought
fifteen acres in Harlem Heights, New York, to build his own estate,
"The Grange," named after his ancestral home in Scotland.  

<p>Tragically, Elizabeth's life changed dramatically in 1804 with
the deaths of both her husband and father. Aaron Burr and Alexander
Hamilton had quarreled over Hamilton's alleged personal slurs
against Burr's reputation and political aspirations, and Burr
challenged Hamilton to a duel, which took place on 11 July 1804.
Told he was just having spasms to prevent her hysterics, Elizabeth
rushed to the mortally wounded Alexander. He left Elizabeth and
his family virtually destitute.  

<p>Left to pay her husband's debts and raise their children (the
youngest was two), Elizabeth relied on the help of friends and
family. The death of her father four months after her husband's
provided her with some financial relief through her inheritance
of property and money. She was able to repurchase The Grange,
which had been sold at public auction. She also petitioned the
government for her husband's army pension that he had waived.
Not granted until 1837 through a special act of Congress, her
petition provided her with $30,000 and included land.  

<p>Even though Elizabeth spent her widowhood in poverty, she was
active in charitable organizations. She held positions in the
New York Orphan Asylum Society and founded orphanages in New
York City and Washington, D.C. She was known to take homeless
children into her own home. To establish her husband's political
legacy and repair his reputation, she spent nearly fifty years
after his death collecting and preserving his papers and letters.
She corresponded with and visited the leading Federalists to
collect papers and other information concerning her husband.
Ironically, none of her correspondence to Alexander survived,
although she did save his letters to her.  

<p>Throughout her life Elizabeth Hamilton staunchly defended her
husband against his critics, maintaining his authorship of Washington's
"Farewell Address" and refusing to acknowledge his responsibility
in the duel and sexual scandals of his life. James Monroe had
accused Alexander of financial irregularities during the Reynolds
affair. Steadfast until the end, Elizabeth demanded a complete
apology, which Monroe would not give, but before her death he
visited Elizabeth to reconcile their differences concerning her
husband's reputation. Alexander Hamilton's papers were not published
until 1850-1851 by his son, John Church Hamilton, and after the
U.S. government had purchased them in 1849. Elizabeth lived her
final years in Washington, D.C., with her daughter Eliza Hamilton
Holly. She was buried with her husband in the graveyard of Trinity
Church in New York City.     

 
<p><b>Bibliography:</b> Most of the information on Elizabeth Hamilton must be gleaned
from biographies written about her husband. Broadus Mitchell
has written widely on Hamilton, including <i>Alexander Hamilton</i>
(2 vols., 1957-1962). Allan McLane Hamilton, the grandson of
Alexander and the son of Philip, the youngest child, has selected
and compiled many letters and other documents written by Hamilton
in <i>The Intimate Life of Alexander Hamilton</i> (1910). His narrative
is one of the more comprehensive for information on Elizabeth.
Other useful biographies include Forrest McDonald, <i>Alexander
Hamilton: A Biography</i> (1979); Robert A. Hendrickson, <i>The Rise
and Fall of Alexander Hamilton</i> (1981); Noemie Emery, <i>Alexander 
Hamilton: An Intimate Portrait</i> (1982); and Jacob Ernest Cooke,
<i>Alexander Hamilton</i> (1982). For the later years of her life and
charity work, see George W. Bethune, <i>Memoirs of Mrs. Joanna Bethune</i> (1863).</p>
