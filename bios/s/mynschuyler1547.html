<strong>Myndert Schuyler</strong></a> was born in October 1711. He was the third son of <a href="dadschuyler1263.html">David Davidse</a> and <a href="../r/elsrutgers.html">Elsie Rutgers</a> Schuyler. Both his father and namesake <a href="mynschuyler101.html">uncle</a> would be <a href="../../mayors.html">mayors</a> of Albany. However, David Davidse died in 1715 when Myndert was only four. His mother re-married a few years later and moved to Kingston.

<p>In November 1734, Myndert was admitted to the <a href="../../sources.html#bf">fr</a>eemanship of New York City. At that time he was described as a "painter and glazier." We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> more information on his adult life.

<p>In June 1735, he married Elizabeth Wessels of New York. By 1752, eight children had been christened at the New York <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.


<p>Myndert Schuyler filed a will in November 1770. He died in New York in October 1772. The will passed probate in June 1773. His widow lived until 1787.</p>
