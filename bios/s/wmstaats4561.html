<P><a href="#sources"><b>William Staats</b></a> was born in 1736. He was the eldest surviving son in the Albany family of cooper <a href="isstaats4592.html">Isaac Staats</a> and his wife, <a href="../vd/mavdu5554.html">Maria Van Deusen</a> Staats.</p>

<p>Living first in his father's first ward home, William Staats started 
        out as a frontier <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> - traveling 
        to Niagara in 1761 and trading across the Indian country. By the end of 
        the decade, he had returned to Albany to become a Hudson River <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html#1774">skipper</a>. 
        Among his regular clients, was <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a> 
        - for whom he carried cargoes and dispatches on his Albany-based sloop. 
        In partnership with his younger brother, merchant <a href="hestaats4587.html">Henry 
        Staats</a>, William began to acquire Albany property in the heart of the 
        city that included the original <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler 
        house</a>.</p>
      <p>He was thirty-five years old at the time of his marriage to young <a href="../y/anyates4448.html">Anna 
        Yates</a> in May 1771. Over the next two decades, their nine children 
        were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> 
        where he was a member and church <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">officer</a>.</p>
      <p>Captain William Staats served as a constable, inspector, and tax collector 
        but did not hold elective office. He contributed to the revolutionary 
        cause and was awarded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> 
        in conjunction with the first regiment of the Albany County militia.</p>
      <p>Over the next thirty years, his family resided in an evolving Staats-owned 
        <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html#state">complex of buildings</a> located 
        south and east of State and Pearl Streets respectively. His first ward 
        household was large - including seven slaves in 1800. In his mid-sixties, 
        official records then identified him as a "mariner."</p>

        <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. City <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a> 
        identify him as the "collector of taxes."
		
<p>Eighty-nine-year-old William Staats <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=%22william+staats%22+albany&source=bl&ots=SretVJxiBk&sig=l9l_OfuKbfWudxEN8nRE-YoEkPQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiSkKPZ4ojUAhVHw4MKHQKvDqw4ChDoAQgmMAE#v=onepage&q=%22william%20staats%22%20albany&f=false">died</a> 
        in May 1825 and was buried from his residence at 77 Hudson Street. His widow passed on in 1829.</p>
