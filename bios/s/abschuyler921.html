          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Abraham Davidse Schuyler</B></A> was born 
            in August 1663. He was the eldest surviving son of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
            pioneers <a href="dapschuyler1262.html">Davidse Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vp/cavplanck.html">Catharina 
            Verplanck</a> Schuyler. As a young man, he represented his father's 
            trading interests in the Indian country. Living among the Senecas 
            for extended periods, he also <a href="../../cia.html">represented 
            Albany</a> as an agent and interpreter. But following the untimely 
            death of David Pieterse in 1690, Abraham was called home to manage 
            the Albany end of the family business. At that time, he settled in 
            Albany and into the life of a merchant and civic leader.</P>

          <P>Marriage represented a first step in setting down community roots. He wed <a href="../t/getbroeck46.html">Geertruy 
            Ten Broeck</a> in 1691 - the daughter of one of Albany's founders. 
            Because only two children were born during the first decade of the 
            marriage, their family of five children was much smaller than the 
            early Albany <a href="../../marriages.html">average</a>. Abraham was 
            an active member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>, 
            where, despite absences from Albany, he was a frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>More and more an export merchant, in his younger days Abraham Schuyler had been master of a Hudson River sloop. Thus, he was experienced in the sales and transport phases of bartering furs, farm, and forest products for imported items in New York.</p>

<p>From about 1690 to 1701,  Abraham Schuyler was a <a href="../../census1697.html#128">prominent</a> Albany figure. Connected to the most <a href="#important">important</a> early Albany families, his <a href="#house">landmark home</a> near the north gate was a center of city-based business. Serving as assessor, assistant, alderman, and judge, over a twenty year period, he literally spoke for Albany in dealings with the Indians.</p>  

          <p>In 1709, he accompanied his cousin, <a href="pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a>, 
            and <a href="http://www.tyendinaga.net/hmrc/page1.htm">four Mohawk 
            chiefs</a> to England and an audience with Queen Anne. He acted as 
            interpreter on their mission to obtain military and spiritual assistance 
            for the Iroquois. He returned home in 1710 and resumed his multi-faceted 
            career. One of the more visible Albany <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city 
            fathers</a>, Abraham Schuyler <a href="../../peace.html">continued 
            to go</a> to Canada and into the Indian country on diplomatic missions 
            for the Albany <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. 
            He held a provincial appointment as "Overseer of the Indian Trade," 
            captained a company of Indian scouts, held a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
            commission, and was called "Captain" and "Major."</p>

 
<p>Barely middle-aged, Abraham Schuyler had filed a <a href="../../wills/willabschuyler921.html">will</a> in 1709. It left an extensive estate to Geertruy during her widowhood. Even into his sixties, Schuyler continued to travel on diplomatic business. Seventeen years later, in July 1726, he died in the Seneca country following a brief illness. His  widow lived in their house on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> for more than a dozen years.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Abraham Davidse Schuyler</B> 
            is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 921. This profile is derived chiefly 
            from <a href="../../sources.html#csg">family</a> and community-based 
            resources. Because of his diplomatic career, much additional information 
            has been derived from the <a href="../../sources.html#nycd"><i>New 
            York Colonial Documents</i></a> series.</p>

          <p><a name=important></a>The Verplanck (mother's family) connection 
            gave him entre to Manhattan trading circles. His father-in-law was 
            <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a>. His younger brother, 
            <a href="mynschuyler101.html">Myndert Schuyler</a>, became mayor of 
            Albany in 1719.</p>

          <p><a name=house></a>He lived in the <b>house</b> built by his father 
            on the southeastern corner of Market and Steuben Streets. He shared 
            that complex structure with his <a href="../vp/cavplanck.html">mother</a> 
            until her death in 1708. That home remained in the Schuyler family 
            throughout the eighteenth century. He also owned another "little house 
            on the street with a lot in the rear" either adjacent or located nearby. 
            Perhaps the "little house" was owned by <a href="jacschuyler1326.html">Jacobus 
            Schuyler</a>, a still-younger brother who died in 1707!</P>
