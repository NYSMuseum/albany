<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Spencer</strong></a> was born in 1752. He was the son of Rhode Islanders Thomas and Margaret Goddard Spencer. His father <a href="http://rifa.art.yale.edu/detail.htm?id=30032&type=1">was</a> a shipwright/cordwainer and sheriff but died when Thomas was a year old. His mother then moved the family to Newport where her sons were trained by her brother as shop <a href="../../trades/wood.html">joiners</a>.

<p>In 1776, Thomas married his cousin, Mary Stafford, the daughter of future Albany resident <a href="jobstafford.html">Job Stafford</a>. We have not yet established his connection to a particular Albany <a href="../../churches.html">church</a>. 

<p>After a decade of woodworking and landholding in Rhode Island, in 1783 Thomas rented lots in <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>, New York and moved there to pursue his craft. At that time, he <a href="http://rifa.art.yale.edu/detail.htm?id=30032&type=1">identified</a> himself as a "merchant of Providence."

<p>By 1786, this transplanted <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> had moved west again and was <a href="http://rifa.art.yale.edu/detail.htm?id=30032&type=1">known</a> in Rhode Island as "a trader of Albany."

<p>He set up his store <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#thsp">and</a> home near the Albany waterfront and advertized in the <a href="../../ag.html">news</a>papers. For a time, he kept a <a href="jostaff7239.html">boarder</a> and also acquired additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> along the waterfront and in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">Pastures</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#thsp">1790</a>, the census configured his first ward home with ten family members. A decade later in <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, only Thomas and five young people remained.

<p>In <a href="../../doc/1794sl.html#ts">1794</a>, he was among the subscribers in support of the establishment of Union College.

<p>In June 1799, he advertized for sale "a valuable printing office with almost every necessary article belonging to a Printing office. Very low for cash or on short credit for approved security." At that time, he also was <a href="http://historical.hsl.virginia.edu/treasures/baillie.html">known</a> as a printer and bookseller. In 1793, writer and publisher <a href="../t/sitiffany.html">Silvester Tiffany</a> had an office at Spencer's Albany bookstore. However, the name of Thomas Spencer is absent from the rolls of the contemporary <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=%22spencer+thomas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22spencer%20thomas%22&f=false">1813</a>, his name appeared in the city directory at the address of 320 Washington Avenue (formerly <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion</a> Street). Beginning in 1813, a Thomas Spencer was involved in an enterprise known as "Union Air Furnace" at the Lion Street/Washington Avenue address. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1820</a>, Thomas Spencer (this individual would have been sixty-eight) lived at 33 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. At some time after that, an elderly Thomas Spencer appears to have left Albany.

<p>The presence of a number of same-named contemporaries in New York <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~steeles/Steele/d150.htm">and</a> in Albany County dictates <a href="../qqqq.html">caution</a> in fleshing out the life of this Albany resident. Thus, we move <a href="../../inprog.html">on</a> for now.

<p>Thomas Spencer lost his wife in September or October 1797. <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/cgi-bin/print.cgi?spencer::7435.html">Perhaps</a>, he re-married. He is said to have died in Athens, New York in January 1840.</p>
