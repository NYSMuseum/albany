<strong>Jaepie Schepmoes</strong></a> may have been born in January 1647. She was the daughter of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> Jan Janse and Sarah Pieters Schepmoes. She grew up in New Amsterdam.


<p>In 1666, she married <a href="../h/geharden8336.html">Gerrit Hardenburgh</a>. Over the next two decades, the marriage produced at least eight children who were christened in the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch churches</a> of New York and Albany.  

<p>Within a few years of their marriage, the couple re-located to Albany where they both joined the Albany church. Their Albany house was on the hill on or near <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. Gerrit Hardenburgh was a fur trader and skipper.

<p>By 1686, he had moved his family back to New York where he seems to have died sometime after 1690.

<p>Jaepie Schepmoes Hardenburgh was last heard from in the Albany record at the christening of her daughter in October 1683. However, she is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have died in New York in November 1732.</p>
