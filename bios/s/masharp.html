<strong>Maria Sharp</strong></a> was born in July 1737. She was the last child born to the marriage of  <a href="thsharp7016.html">Thomas</a> and <a href="../d/madwarr7861.html">Maria De Warran</a> Sharp. She grew up in a barber's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> but lost her mother when she was twelve.

<p>In 1763, she was past twenty-five when she married newcomer <a href="../m/jmonier.html">John Monier</a>. Their marriage probably was childless. However, she seems to have remained closely connected to the siblings named as heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willthsharp.html">will</a> filed by her father in 1771.

<p>Monier was a former British soldier who established a base along the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">road</a> leading west out of Albany. Royalist ties enabled him to prosper as their <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home was an  Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">landmark</a>. However, British connections placed his fortune in jeopardy as Monier eventually was <a href="../../friends.html">imprisoned</a> by the revolutionaries probably leaving Mary to fall back on the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">households</a> of her sisters and n'er do well <a href="jasharp.html">brother</a>.

<p>After the war, Monier was able to <a href="../../census1790.html#monier">re-establish</a> himself in Albany and eventually to open a lumberyard. He was dead or gone by 1799 when "Mary Monier" was listed several times on the city <a href="../../poor.html#7026">relief rolls</a>.

<p>Maria Sharp Monier may have died in February 1802 when "Jacobus Sharp's sister" was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
