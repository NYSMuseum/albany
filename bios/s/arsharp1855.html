<strong>Ariaantie Sharp</strong></a> most likely was born during the 1720s. She would have been the daughter of <a href="thsharp7016.html">Thomas</a> and <a href="../d/madwarr7861.html">Maria De Warran</a> Sharp. Unlike her siblings, her baptism does not appear to have been recorded in the extant records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> or at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> where Thomas Sharp was a member. As late as <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1786sl">1786</a>, "Ariantie Sharp" was listed among the subscribers at the Dutch church.
 
<p> She grew up in a moderate-sized family in a barber's <a href="../../census1756.html#111">home</a> in the first ward. Her mother died in 1748 but her father did not re-marry.

<p>Thomas Sharp's <a href="../../wills/willthsharp.html">will</a>, filed in 1771, left the unmarried Sharp sisters his house and lot in Albany as long as they remained single. Never marrying, Anna and Ariaantie Sharp lived in the family homestead for the rest of the century. Their married <a href="masharp.html">sister</a> and n'er-do-well <a href="jasharp.html">brother</a> were similarly long-lived and remained in Albany as well. 

<p>From the mid-1770s on, the names of <a href="ansharp7019.html">Anna</a> and Ariaantie Sharp appeared on Albany rolls but mostly <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jas">under</a> that of Jacobus Sharp although his father had barred him from inheriting the family estate. In <a href="../../census1790.html#jas">1790</a>, his first ward household included three females. Most likely, two of them  were the aging Sharp sisters.

<p>Ariaantie Sharp or her sister probably died before 1800 as the census counted only one older women in the first ward <a href="../../census1800.html#jas">home</a> of their brother. In August 1802, church records noted the burial of "Jacobus Sharp's sister."</p>
