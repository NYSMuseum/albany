<P><a href="../../res/ts.html">T</a>raditional sources hold that <a href="#sources"><b>Silvester Salisbury</b></a> was born in Wales perhaps in <a href="https://www.geni.com/people/Sylvester-Salisbury/6000000001044205054">1629</a>. We seek more definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and <a href="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/commons-jrnl/vol7/pp808-811">career</a> prior to emigration.</p>

<p>He is said to have been part of the English force that captured <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland in 1664. Thereafter, he was called "Captain" and appeared at court a number of times in New York City. He then was placed in <a href="http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/nyhsrg11/dsc.html">command</a> of the Duke's <a href="../../garrison.html">soldiers</a> at Albany. The English <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> overlooking the community was built during his tenure. In 1678, he was instrumental in the construction of a "<a href="http://www.waterworkshistory.us/NY/Albany/1678system.htm">Water</a>" conduit to the fort.

<p>About 1670, he was appointed <i>schout</i> or <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a>. Over the next decade, he appeared frequently before the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#cma">court</a> as prosecutor and plaintiff. As fort commander, he also presided over courts martials involving garrison soldiers.</p>

      <p>He owned a number of Albany properties. Connected to the provincial government, 
        he also patented <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> at Catskill 
        in partnership with <a href="../vb/mgvb6656.html">Marte Gerritse</a>. 
        However, Salisbury's name did not appear on a <a href="../../census1679.html">census</a> 
        of Albany householders taken in March 1679. 
      <p>Probably during the 1660s, he married <a href="../b/elbeeck.html">Elizabeth Beeck</a>. The marriage produced at least four surviving children.</p>

      <p>Silvester Salisbury filed a <a href="../../wills/willsisalisbury.html">will</a> 
        in August 1679. He was dead by the following March and his widow remarried 
        in 1682.</p>
