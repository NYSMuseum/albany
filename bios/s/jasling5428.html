<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Slingerland</strong></a> was born in February 1763. He was the son of Isaac and Eva Van Woert Slingerland.



<p>In May 1790, he married Catherine Van Evere at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.. By 1795, five children had been christened in Albany. Catharine apparently died as by 1799, he had married Cornelia Van Alstyne. Their child was born in 1800.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5428">1790</a>, two unspecified females shared his first ward home.

<p>In August <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">1797</a>, he was identified as a freeholder and carpenter who lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.
  
<p>Perhaps this individual was an officer in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> in <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york/military-minutes-of-the-council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york-1783-18-2nu/page-45-military-minutes-of-the-council-of-appointment-of-the-state-of-new-york-1783-18-2nu.shtml">1803</a>. 

<p>After that, our sweep of community-based and Internet <a href="../../res/resmenu.html">resources</a> have not yet yielded additional information on the life and passing of one-time Albany resident Jacob Slingerland. With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on at this time. </p>
