<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, <a href="#sources"><strong>William Sole</strong></a> was an Albany resident during the second half of the eighteenth century. We seek definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. At this point we <a href="../../res/guess.html">believe</a> that he is not Albany contemporary  <a href="../z/wmzob.html">William Zoble</a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Sobel). 

<p>In June 1758, Sole married the widow Margarita <a href="../w/wyn.html">Wyn</a>gaert Phillips at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as living in the "this city." By 1767, four children had been christened at the church.

<p>In September 1759, he purchased a lot from <a href="../a/jaadams7092.html">James Adams</a> for &pound;150 located on the west side of the highway leading to the pasture and bordered on the south by "old" <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a>. At that time, both parties were identified as Albany "<a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">yeomen</a>." In March 1761, he purchased an adjoining lot from <a href="../vi/abvi2276.html">Abraham Myndertse</a>.

<p>Curiously, his name has not been found on available <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> from the 1760s. However, in October <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">1779</a> his property was valued on the city assessment roll.

<p>Perhaps this individual <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the Revolutionary army. A William Sole was an enlisted man on a roster of Willett's Levies late in the war. He also was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XMDwh3d0HAwC&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=%22william+sole%22+soldier&source=bl&ots=FbfCz2_eAF&sig=vqfBeNB7gZHEfPSwUTPl6COekt0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8_cWT_TkHqPb0QGFotzSAg&ved=0CFAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22william%20sole%22%20soldier&f=false">identified</a> as "quartermaster Serjeant."   Afterwards, his name was included on a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#2382">list</a> of those accorded land bounty rights in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>After that, Sole's name was no longer found on Albany rolls. Additionally, other same-named contemporaries fought in the war.   
 
<p><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=hTRGY_hZ34sC&pg=PA439&lpg=PA439&dq=%22william+sole%22+albany&source=bl&ots=q_GXnoAd8E&sig=IONgAS_p8UcC8sn6CCr4NquMwGE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sewWT4W3BuPb0QHuyuiMAw&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22william%20sole%22%20albany&f=false">Perhaps</a> our William Sole was among "Willett's men" who were killed in Canada in 1781.

<p>Fourteen years <a href="http://www.lennoxandaddingtonhistoricalsociety.ca/UCDeaths.html">later</a>, "buried 12 April, 1795, Margaret, the wife of William Sole of Ernesttown. [Likely buried at Bath.] Rev. John Langhorn's Register, Anglican Diocese of Ontario." 

<p>Thanks to the <a href="../../res/irs.html">Internet</a>, the last two senarios represent <a href="../../res/guess.html">conjecture</a> and we are not at all certain that the information relates to the one-time Albany resident and family man known as William Sole.
  
<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of the one-time Albany resident William Sole.</p>
