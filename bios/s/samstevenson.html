<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Stevenson</strong></a> was the keeper of the "Tory Gaol" at the outbreak of hostilities in 1776. Although probably connected to the Anglo-ancestry <a href="jastevenson3901.html">Stevenson</a> family of early Albany, we have not yet definitively placed him demographically. Thus, we seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. We exercise caution here due to the existence of a number of same-named contemporaries.

<p>Perhaps, this individual did not marry as no references to him have been found in the extant records of early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, a <a href="mgtstevenson.html">Margaret Stevenson</a> Fowler gave birth to  a son christened "Samuel Stevenson Fowler" in 1798.

<p>In April 1776, he petitioned the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> for his pay as jailer saying that he "has served long and without pay." He appears to have received some compensation but was slated to be replaced as soon as a successor could be found. In August, he was superceded as keeper by <a href="../d/vodawson7796.html">Volkert Dawson</a>. Perhaps, Samuel   was a <a href="../../friends.html">British adherent</a> as were "other" <a href="jostevenson2244.html">members</a> of the Albany Stevenson family.

<p>In October <a href="../../org/cc.html#1775">1775</a>, he had been <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA274&lpg=PA274&dq=%22samuel+stephenson%22+albany&source=bl&ots=jw5JTvq4fZ&sig=WiraXwTH0070LfQo_k3VYmcRAiA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6-r-T_TTEKr40gHt5NSMBw&ved=0CFIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22samuel%20stephenson%22%20albany&f=false">elected</a> constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. At this point, it appears to be the sole reference to him encountered in the "<a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a>."

<p>Our search for information on his life after the mid-1770s has taken us to the historical records of greater New York and beyond.
 
<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of a Samuel Stevenson was configured with a man, a boy, and one woman in Eastchester, Westchester County. Perhaps that individual previously was granted a land <a href="../../guide/histres.html#military">bounty right</a> in conjunction <a href="http://archive.org/stream/newyorkrevolution01statrich#page/268/mode/2up">with</a> a Westchester militia regiment. 

<p>His name has not been encountered in the available <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/albany/refchurch.html">records</a> of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html"> 
Dutch church</a>. However, in August 1798, a Samuel Stevenson <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/gbrcms.htm">married</a> Elizabeth Jones at the Greenbush Reformed church.


<p>In 1799, <a href="mgtstevenson.html">perhaps</a> his grandson was christened "Samuel Stevenson Fowler" in Albany. The boy's <a href="../f/wmfowler.html">father</a> is said to have been from Eastchester.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, the house, lot, and property of "Sam'l Stevenson" located "in" <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a> was valued modestly. 

<p>We seek lifecourse information on this Samuel Stevenson. With so many outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we move on for now! </p>
