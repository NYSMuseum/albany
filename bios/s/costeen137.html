<P><a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelis Steenwyck</strong></a> is <a href="http://www.werelate.org/wiki/Person:Cornelis_Van_Steenwyck_%281%29">said</a> to have been born in Haarlem, North Holland in March 1626. Although this notable founder still lacks an adequate biography, this sketch <a href="#focus">focuses</a> on his time in Beverwyck/Albany.

<p>He acquired and parlayed extensive real estate holdings on <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tfRSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22cornelis+steenwyck%22&source=bl&ots=LfbYHG7KqA&sig=Xiyn6ktIu8drFHpnd_k9sSwtLRo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7aysUrH_MrWgsATm04DwBw&ved=0CFUQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20steenwyck%22&f=false">Manhattan</a> and its environs into one of the more substantial fortunes of his generation.

<p>He was in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> by July 1655 when he represented "Gabriel Leendertsen" and others in a real estate transaction. At that time, he was identified as a "trader at Amsterdam, New Netherland." 

<p>In June 1658, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cZUyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA6&lpg=RA1-PA6&dq=%22cornelis+steenwyck%22&source=bl&ots=pOJAkj8Ly6&sig=3VfkaqHf-nXVnUhlVkDmZZbdrPM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7aysUrH_MrWgsATm04DwBw&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20steenwyck%22&f=false">married</a> Margarita de Reimers in New Amsterdam. She was the eldest daughter of a prominent Manhattan merchant. By 1676, the couple had christened at least seven children.

<p>Prior to September 1664, Steenwyck held a number of public <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pmQQaowpTacC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=%22cornelis+steenwyck%22&source=bl&ots=vr-VmMF4ie&sig=oBDBLfUU4xlluRXUmeANAeNm2I4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7aysUrH_MrWgsATm04DwBw&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22cornelis%20steenwyck%22&f=false">positions</a> in New Amsterdam.


<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>, his name was among those that <a href="../../census1679.html#nl">appeared</a> and the end of a list of Albany householders with the identifying notation "The following have not yet any lot." Nevertheless, he was assessed for "3 rods," a burden comparable to that of the community's substantial traders.

<p>In 1668 and again in 1683, he was named mayor of New York. Each time, he held the office for a few years.

<p>Cornelis Steenwyck died in New York City in 1684. Governor Dongan <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8LAFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA168&dq=abstracts+of+wills+1899#v=onepage&q&f=false">probated</a> his will in April 1685. His extensive estate was described in an <a href="#inv">inventory</a> in 1686. Steenwyck's widow (and heir) married Domine Hendricus Selyns.

<p>Manhattan <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/exhibit/cornelius-steenwyck-1684">mogul</a> Cornelis Steenwyck was one of a number of outsiders who held property and conducted business in seventeenth century Albany. To cateqorize him as an occasional resident and stakeholder  (more than a visitor) may not be in-appropriate.</p>
