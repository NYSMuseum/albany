<P><a href="#sources"><b>Helena Sanders</b></a> was born into the large family of Albany and New York entrepreneur <a href="rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a> and his wife, <a href="../vkl/elvkleeck1048.html">Elsie Barents Van Kleeck</a> - probably during the early 1670s.</p>


<p>After losing her father in 1703, she married twenty-nine-year-old Albany businessman <a href="../l/joglansing2051.html">Johannes G. Lansing</a> at her mother's house in Albany in September 1704. By 1727, six of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A seventh <a href="../l/salansing3756.html">child</a> may have been christened elsewhere. Information on her family was recorded in their <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyrensse/bible22.htm">family bible</a>.</p>

<p>These Lansings were prominent residents of Albany's <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a>. 

<p>Helena Sanders Lansing died in June 1744 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church. Her husband lived until 1771.</p>
