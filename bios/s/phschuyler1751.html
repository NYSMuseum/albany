<strong>Philip P. Schuyler</strong></a> was born in April 1736. He was the son of <a href="pischuyler1736.html">Pieter Jr.</a> and <a href="../g/cagroesbeck3268.html">Catharina Groesbeck</a> Schuyler. He grew up in a large family in a trader's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home and on a farm <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">north</a> of Albany. His father died in 1753 when Philip was about eighteen.

      <p>In April 1765, he married Albany native <a href="../w/anwendell8207.html">Anna 
        Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 
        1785, nine children were christened in the church where he was a lifelong 
        member and later a member of the church consistory. 
      <p>From the mid-1760s, his <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farm was valued on contemporary <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. In 1769, he was identified as in possession of the 
 farm located north of Albany and <a href="../../wills/willsvr5114.html">owned</a> by Stephen Van Rensselaer II. It was scheduled to be transferred to his <a href="../vr/elvr5075.html">daughter</a> following the Patroon's death. However, he seems to have held that property for the remainder of his life. 

<p>With the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he supported the crusade for American liberties as an active <a href="../../coc.html">member</a> of the Rensselaerswyck committee. He stood out by signing the oath of secrecy and the <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">General Association</a>. An experienced officer in the provincial <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eLcBAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA12-PA1067&lpg#PRA14-PT158,M1">militia</a>, he was commissioned colonel of the Third or Watervliet Regiment of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany County militia</a> and saw active duty in the Mohawk Valley, at Saratoga, elsewhere, and against Tories.

<p>After the war, he was approaching fifty and returned to his Watervliet farm. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1751">1790</a>, his household was served by five slaves.

<p>Philip P. Schuyler lost his wife in December 1802. He died in June 1808 and was buried in the family plot. A newspaper <a href="#obit">obituary</a> marked his passing.This "officer in the Revolution" had lived seventy-three years. His eldest <a href="caschuyler1249.html">daughter</a> married jurist Abraham Van Vechten.</p>

in the revolution, which he advocated as a citizen and soldier with an ardor and sincerity that evinced his attachment to his country. He possessed firmness and fortitude

heart. His funeral on Sunday was attended by an unusual 
concourse of friends and citizens, to pay the last tribute 
of respect to departed worth. </p>
