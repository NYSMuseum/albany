<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Stevenson</strong></a> was born in December 1788. He was the son of <a href="jostevenson2244.html">John</a> and <a href="../d/magdouw2152.html">Magdalena Douw</a> Stevenson. Named for the family's Albany patriarch, James had an advantaged even elite upbringing. He would live virtually his entire life in the elegant <a href="jostevenson2244.html#home">home</a> built by his father on upper State Street. Probably an only <a href="../../census1790.html#2244">son</a>, his <a href="sarstevenson.html">sis</a>ters would enhance the family's standing through well-placed <a href="../../marriages.html">marr</a>iages. 

<p>Tory-turned-businesman, John Stevenson dropped dead in 1810 and James became the visible head of the family seat at 90-92 State which he shared with his widowed mother until her passing in 1817.

<p>In August 1813, he is said to have married Rebecca Canon of Greenbush at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. However, <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional resources <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/peltz.html">hold</a> that he died "unmarried" in 1852. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1820c">1820</a>, the census configured his home with two men as the only residents. Without offfspring of his own, a number of Albany boys would be named in his honor. 

<p>This James Stevenson learned the <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a> in the office of <a href="../h/jvhenry.html">John V. Henry</a> and was admitted to the bar. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the extent of his legal training. He was elected to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> and also served on the boards of a number of Albany-based civic and commercial organizations. Over several decades in the nineteenth century,  many/most of the community's leading development and improvement initiatives/enterprises counted on him as an advocate and supporter. In 1826, he was elected <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany and served until 1828 when he is said to have resigned.    

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22stevenson+james%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=stevenson&f=false">1813</a>, he was listed in the city directory as an attorney (counsellor) at 92 State Street. He later lived (and died) at 146 State Street.

<p>Like his father, James was an officer at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. 

<p>Albany native James Stevenson died in July of 1852. He had lived sixty-five years. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> in August. He is <a href="../../dead.html">buried</a> in Albany Rural <a href="http://www.albanyruralcemetery.org/albrurcem/Notable.html">Cemetery</a>. A <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/albanychronicles01reyn/albanychronicles01reyn_djvu.txt">brief notice</a> called him "Wealthy, zealous in public affairs, a polished gentleman." A more intensive and quite worthy <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WqApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=%22james+stevenson%22+%22john+v+henry%22&source=bl&ots=3ZBylYSvzS&sig=5kyDPLxcN0DbBsI-tDdhhFyLXpg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Hf3SUbzfGYfT0wH2gIHwBA&ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22james%20stevenson%22%20%22john%20v%20henry%22&f=false">obituary</a> more fully described his career and character. 

<p>As his long career was set entirely in the nineteenth century (and mostly beyond the <a href="../../criteria.html">defined</a> scope of our study), this sketch is purposely spare. However, Mayor James Stevenson represented the remaining link to an early Albany family whose community <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA444&lpg=PA444&dq=%22james+stevenson%22+albany+mayor&source=bl&ots=jw8JZCp2jS&sig=TCx6-1X-JMs5kQRkOoYDWCC1IgY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=DOPSUdaSCNSj0QHxuIDQBg&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22james%20stevenson%22%20albany%20mayor&f=false">prominence</a> spanned the entire eighteenth century.</p>
