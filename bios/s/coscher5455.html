<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Schermerhorn</strong></a> probably was born about 1670. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="jajscher5448.html">Jacob Janse</a> and Jannetje Segers Schermerhorn. He was the younger brother of <a href="rjscher5490.html">Ryer Schermerhorn</a> and grew up in both Albany and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> homes. In 1688, he was identified as a minor in the <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">will</a> of his father. 
 
 
<p>In 1687, he was identified as an Albany area merchant on a document related to the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In 1684 and again in 1702, he was known as the "master" of a Hudson River sloop. By the late 1690s, Cornelis Jacobse had settled in Albany and lived in a house in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where his household was configured on the <a href="../../census1697.html#106">census</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#5455">1699</a>, he joined with his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. His second ward home was <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5455">taxed</a> comparably to that of other Albany merchants.

<p>He served the community as juror, <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>, constable, and <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> member. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5455">1720</a>, he was a freeholder in the second ward and a contractor of the city government.

<p>In March 1695, he had married <a href="../vb/mavburen.html">Maria Hendricks Van Buren</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1710, six children had been christened at the Albany church where he was a regular baptism sponsor.  In February 1713, he married Margarita Alberts also in Albany. By 1720, that marriage had produced two additional children.
  
<p>By 1720, Cornelis Schermerhorn had relocated to family property in the <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> area. He died in February 1730.</p>
