<strong>Debora Sanders</strong></a> was born in February 1758. She was the daughter of Albany leaders <a href="rosanders1443.html">Robert Sanders</a> and his second wife, <a href="elschuyler1274.html">Elizabeth Schuyler</a> Sanders. Her mother died in July 1763 after contracting a fever. In November 1765, she was among five living children named as heirs in the 
<a href="../../wills/willrosanders1443.html">will</a> filed by her father. Robert Sanders died shortly thereafter leaving her an orphan at the age of seven. 

<p>After that, she probably went to live with her uncle in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> - as <a href="josanders.html">John Sanders</a> was the only surviving executor of Debora's father's estate. 

<p>In February 1777, Debora was nineteen when she married her cousin, John Sanders of Schenectady, at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - where she maintained a pew for the rest of her life. However, all eight of her children born between 1777 and 1792, were christened in Schenectady.

<p>This John Sanders family lived well in Schenectady and at the family retreat across the Mohawk River in Scotia. But Debora occasionally witnessed baptisms in Albany as her sister, <a href="masanders1438.html">Maria</a>, and several cousins married Albany residents.

<p>Debora Sanders died at the end of November 1793 and was buried in Schenectady. Her husband re-married in 1801.</p>
