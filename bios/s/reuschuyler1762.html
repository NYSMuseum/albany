<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Reuben Schuyler</strong></a> was born in January 1762. This uniquely named Schuyler (after his long-deceased maternal <a href="../vv/revvechten2564.html">grandfather</a>) was the second of five sons born to the marriage of Albany natives Steven and Engeltie Van Vechten Schuyler. He grew up among a large family on the Schuyler land north of Albany and near the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flats</a>.



<p>Just in his mid-teens at the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a>, we expect to uncover more information on his wartime service. Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#1762">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany city <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. Additionally, his name appeared with other "enlisted men" on a roster of the Schenectady regiment (Second) of the Albany County militia. Still later, he received a <a href="http://www.fold3.com/document/28763665/">pension</a> for service during the Revolutionary war.

<p>Reuben may have married twice. Perhaps his first wife was Sara Fort who gave birth to a daughter in 1785. Following her passing, Reuben wed Elizabeth Truax at the Prebyterian church in Troy in May 1806. That union produced three children between 1807 and 1815. His second (and much younger) wife <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSob=c&GSlh=1&GRid=86924491&">died</a> in 1838.

<p>Perhaps, he served during the War of 1812 as well. In September 1812, a Reuben Schuyler found himself <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/catharina-visscher-van-rensselaer-bonney/a-legacy-of-historical-gleanings-volume-2-ynn/page-34-a-legacy-of-historical-gleanings-volume-2-ynn.shtml">pardoned</a> by General <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Van Rensselaer</a> - thus recinding an <a href="../qqqq.html">impending</a> "death sentence."

<p>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, Reuben Schuyler kept a family <a href="../../guide/histres.html#bible">bible</a>. It chronicled the birth of some of his children and other family information.

<p>Beginning in 1796, he <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:Hp2WWrDyux0J:legacy.www.nypl.org/research/chss/spe/rbk/faids/schuylerp.pdf+%22reuben+schuyler%22&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi_6nakPzp64UXfBxaY9nQMge3TOLncnLwqUh6ynGCSReDdcgsZqTu2d2QhJD6vhaqKINwLPn_hz4FQTqnwXObav_cVdrjLgxXtSeqVKl3nYHNXjaTuV31_Kb2y944Pr10LGAMG&sig=AHIEtbRkObFmRVbrKwEP2XF26bXnn0vAYQ">exchanged</a> correspondence with <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> on canal-related business.

<p>This individual was known as "Dr. Reuben Schuyler." However, beyond the sources noted above, information on his career has not yet been found in our sweep of available <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based records</a>. We are not comfortable with the <a href="../../res/ts.html">available</a> information on the life of this so-called physician.

<p>Reuben Schuyler died in May 1842 and was buried at the "<a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flatts</a>." He had lived for eighty years. With so many unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on what appears to be a long and presumably conspicuous life, we move on for now! </p>
