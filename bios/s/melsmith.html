<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Melancton Smith</strong></a> (1744-98) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melancton_Smith">was</a> a Long Island-born, businessman and operative who found himself in Albany during the latter stages of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">Rev</a>olutionary war.<a href="https://www.nyhistory.org/web/crossroads/gallery/all/melancton_smith_from_fiske.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/melsmith.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=1 hsapce=4 width=150 alt="woodcut likeness depicting Melancton Smith basically from John Fiske, The Critical Period"></a> 

<p>Settling in Poughkeepsie as a young adult , this patriot-opportunist supported the war and the political revolution serving in a number of state and local <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc14382.htm">capacities</a> which brought him into contact with the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>. During those years, this individual took <a href="http://www.historyisaweapon.com/defcon1/zinnkin5.html">advantage</a> of his positions to acquire extensive lands and other properties in what became upstate New York.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#ms">1781</a>, he was among those newcomers who purchased the so-called "Freedom of Albany." At that time, he was identified as a merchant. We are <a href="../qqqq.html">uncertain</a> as to how long he actually spent in Albany. He seems to have made no other imprint on the community record.


<p>In 1785, he re-located to New York City, continued his political and business activities, and is most celebrated as an antifederal spokesman. He <a href="http://home.eznet.net/~dminor/NYNY1795.html">died</a> in New York during a Yellow Fever outbreak in July 1798.

<p>Although hardly an Albany resident, Melancton Smith apparently was "in business" in the city in 1781.</p>
