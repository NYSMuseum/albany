<strong>Anna Sharp</strong></a> was born in August 1726. She was the daughter of <a href="thsharp7016.html">Thomas</a> and <a href="../d/madwarr7861.html">Maria De Warran</a> Sharp.

<p> She grew up in a moderate-sized family in a barber's <a href="../../census1756.html#111">home</a> in the first ward. Her mother died in 1748 but her father did not re-marry.

<p>Her father's <a href="../../wills/willthsharp.html">will</a>, filed in 1771, left the unmarried Sharp sisters his house and lot in Albany as long as they remained single. Never marrying, Anna and <a href="arsharp1855.html">Ariaantie</a> Sharp lived in the family homestead for the rest of the century. Their married <a href="masharp.html">sister</a> and n'er-do-well <a href="jasharp.html">brother</a> were similarly long-lived and remained in Albany as well. 

<p>From the mid-seventies on, the names of <a href="ansharp7019.html">Anna</a> and Ariaantie Sharp appeared on Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#jas">rolls</a> but mostly under that of Jacobus Sharp although his father had barred him from inheriting the family estate.

<p>Either Anna or Ariaantie Sharp was still living with Jacobus in the family home as late as <a href="../../census1800.html#jas">1800</a>. Church records noted the burial of "Jacobus Sharp's sister" in August 1802.
