<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Maria Staats</strong></a>, the first wife of one-time Albany resident John E. Lansing, probably was born in 1746 and was the daughter of "an"  Abraham and Maria Staats. We have not connected her to the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany</a> area family and seek more definitive documentation on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a>.

<p>By the end of 1766, Maria had married <a href="../l/jolansing3751.html">John E. Lansing</a> of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck. However, their marriage was not recorded at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany where at least five children had been christened by June 1787.

<p>The household of John E. Lansing was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#3751">census</a> of 1790 in the first ward of Albany. At that time, their household included nine family members. After that, this family <a href="../qqqq.html">drops</a> from Albany rolls.

<p>Lansing seems to have re-located to the East Manor and to have re-married in 1807. 

<p>Maria Staats Lansing probably died before 1800. However, we seek information on her <a href="../../res/death.html">p</a>assing.</p>
