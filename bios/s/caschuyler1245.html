<strong>Catharina Schuyler</strong></a> was born in April 1706. She was the daughter of Albany businessman <a href="jacschuyler1326.html">Jacobus D. Schuyler</a> and his second wife, <a href="../w/suwendell2720.html">Susanna Wendell</a> Schuyler. Her father died in 1707 leaving widow Susanna in charge of their <a href="../../wards.html#">third ward</a> home and small family. 

<p>In April 1729, Catharina married Albany native <a href="../r/heroseboom1658.html">Hendrick H. Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1745, seven children had been christened in Albany. 

<p>Catharina's husband died in August 1746 at the age of forty-three. Widow Catharina Schuyler Roseboom was left to raise their large family until their bachelor son <a href="../r/heroseboom1663.html">Hendrick</a> came of age and took over the family home.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, the now fifty-year-old widow was not among the eleven Roseboom-named heads of households noted on the census of Albany homes taken by the British army. 

<p>The mother of Henry Roseboom of Albany was noted and called "Cathalina Maebie" in the <a href="../../wills/willheroseboom1663.html">will</a> he filed in May 1769.
 
<p>We seek more definitive information on her later life and passing.</p>
