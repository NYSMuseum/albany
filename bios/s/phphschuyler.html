<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Ph. Schuyler</strong></a> was born in February 1668. He was the eighth son born to the marriage of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vs/mvslicht.html">Margarita Van Slichtenhorst</a> Schuyler. Sometimes called "Captain" and/or "Philip Schuyler, Jr.," this individual  grew up in the large and pre-eminent family of Albany and its environs.

<p>In May 1683, he was among those <a href="../../wills/willphpischuyler.html">named</a> as heirs of the estate of his parents. At that time, he was seventeen years old. Philip Pieterse died the next year leaving widow Margarita as sole parent and manager of extensive holdings in Albany and beyond.

<p>In August 1687, he married <a href="../d/eldemeyer.html">Elizabeth De Meyer</a> of New York City. She was a younger child of the wealthy former mayor of New York City. That marriage produced only two children before Elizabeth's death in 1712. Their only surviving <a href="nischuyler1730.html">son</a> became a prominent Schenectady mainliner. In May 1719, widower "Philippus" married a somewhat younger widow Catharina <a href="../../res/sp.html">S</a>cherp (Brouwer). That union would have been childless.

<p>He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Qe4QAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA13&lpg=RA2-PA13&dq=philip+schuyler+de+meyer&source=bl&ots=yrrqs_SR1I&sig=QpLFri3Fw3VNhSL3xeF4VRgx-9I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=IhUMULiLFYXl0QHQ_oT2Aw&ved=0CDwQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=philip%20schuyler%20de%20meyer&f=false">said</a> to have lived in Kingston, New York, Albany, and Schenectady. 

<p>Probably in 1707, he was bequeathed an equal share of his mother's <a href="../../wills/willmgtvslicht.html">estate</a>. 

<p>Philip Philipse Schuyler died in Schenectady in May 1724. He had lived but fifty-six years. </p>
