<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Myndert Schuyler</B></A> was born at the 
            <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Schuyler farm</a> in January 
            1672. He was the fourth son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="dapschuyler1262.html">David 
            Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vp/cavplanck.html">Catharina Ver Planck</a> 
            Schuyler.</P>

<p>In 1693, he married <a href="../c/racuyler605.html">Rachel Cuyler</a> 
            in New York City. Although both partners were of <a href="../../marriages.html">prime</a> 
            childbearing age, their marriage produced only <a href="anschuyler932.html">one 
            daughter</a> who married future Albany mayor <a href="../d/jodp.html">Johannes 
            De Peyster</a>. Myndert Schuyler recorded family data in his <a href="#bible">bible</a>. It then passed to the care of his son-in-law.</p>

          <p>Myndert Schuyler was a successful trader, merchant, and contractor 
            who parlayed those profits into extensive <a href="#property">real 
            estate</a> holdings throughout the region. He established his Albany 
            <a href="../../census1697.html#002">headquarters</a> on the south 
            side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> just east 
            of the principal <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler home</a>.</p>

<p>Consequently, he was a prominent participant in all phases of city life. He served the Albany government as juror, constable, alderman, and was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of the city in 1719. He was re-appointed in 1720 and again in 1723. He also was elected to represent Albany in the New York General Assembly - having been elected five times from 1701 to 1709, in 1713, twice from 1716 to 1726, and again in 1728. For many years, he held the office of Albany County surrogate. He also served as a member of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a> over a period that spanned half a century.</p>

<p>Myndert Schuyler was a pillar of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - serving as deacon, elder, and church master. He stood as a baptismal sponsor more than two dozen times.  In 1710, he was identified as a captain in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a>. In 1714, he was referred to as "Major" Myndert Schuyler.</p>

<P>By the 1730s, Myndert Schuyler was living in retirement on State Street in a house next to that of his daughter and her family. Rachel Cuyler Schuyler became ill and died in 1747 after being bedridden for nine years.</P>

<p>Myndert Schuyler died in October 1755 at age eighty-three. He was buried beneath the Albany Dutch church.</P>
