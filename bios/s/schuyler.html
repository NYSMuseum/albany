<P><a href="#coat"><img src="../../images/jpg/schuylercrest.jpg" align=right border=0 width=200 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Schuyler coat of arms by Marcus T. Reynolds"></a>The <a href="#sources"><b>Schuylers</b></a> were foremost among early Albany's founders and leaders and became one of the most prominent <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> families in  colonial New York!</p>

<p>The Schuyler story in America began with the arrival of brothers <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse</a> and <a href="dapschuyler1262.html">David Pieterse</a> about 1650. The rise of these one-time tradesmen is a classic early American success story! They were among the founders of the trading community called <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>, prominent <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">fur traders</a>, and able to acquire <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">land</a> in what became the Albany hinterland.</p>

<p>By the close of the seventeenth century, <a href="../../census1697.html">nine</a> Schuyler-named households were counted in the city of Albany. These included the homes of first mayor <a href="pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a> and two more future <a href="../../mayors.html">mayors</a> of the city.</p>

<p>During the first half of the eighteenth century, the Schuylers branched-out into greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> - establishing country seats up and down the Hudson Valley, into New York City, and to <a href="arschuyler97.html">New Jersey</a>. They were able to <a href="../../marriages.html">intermarry</a> with the most important colonial families thus establishing crucial kinship networks throughout the colony. With several untimely deaths, the Albany Schuylers experienced a temporary leadership void that was eased by the marriage of <a href="elschuyler1274.html">Elizabeth Schuyler</a> to widower <a href="../s/rosanders1443.html">Robert Sanders</a> in 1747.</p>
  

In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, six Schuyler households were prominent on Albany's best streets with <a href="../vc/covcortlandt6662.html">widow Schuyler's home</a> a community <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">landmark</a> since the 1680s. Her son, <a href="phschuyler1750.html">General Philip Schuyler</a>, built <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a>, served in the colonial Assembly, was a General in the Revolutionary army, and served in the United State Senate. His business revolved around sawing and shipping lumber from his Saratoga estate.<p></p>
 

In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the General's city estate called "the Pastures" was one of just two Schuyler households listed on the first Federal census. In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1815</a>, the city directory named three Schuyler householders including <a href="sschuyler8492.html">Captain Samuel Schuyler</a>.<p></p> 

<p><img src="../../images/modern/pscityhall.jpg" align=left width=100 border=2 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="statue of Philip Schuyler in front of City Hall">The possible connection of the <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Black</a> Schuylers (<font size=-1>descendants of Captain <a href="sschuyler8492.html">Samuel Schuyler</a></font size>) to the descendants of Philip and David Pieterse has not been established definitively!</p> 

<p>Today, <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a> State Historic Site, <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Schuyler Flats</a> park, the Schuyler House in Schuylerville, Philip Schuyler Elementary School, Philip Schuyler condominiums, and dozens of local establishments commemorate the family today. For more than two hundred years, the name "Schuyler" has been used frequently across the country in the naming of places and organizations. It seems to connote the confidence and success that characterized early Albany's first family!

<a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> Our work on the Schuyler family represents a textbook example of the viability of historical scholarship based primarily on <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. At the same time, historians and genealogists have produced an impressive number of exemplary published resources that we use throughout our expositions. Chief among them are <a href="../../fhg.html#csg"><i>Christoph's Schuyler Genealogy</i></a>; Don Gerlach's <a href="phschuyler1750.html#biography">two volumes</a> of a three-part biography of General Philip Schuyler; and a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yTveN16gs2wC&pg=PA278&lpg=PA278&dq=%22cortlandt+schuyler%22&source=web&ots=pZyz1Vzgzp&sig=LMsbRBxnUbfcWKxXNMZzcrJ4bfE#PPP7,M1">landmark antiquarian work</a> by George Washington Schuyler entitled <i>Colonial New York: Philip Schuyler and His Family</i> (New York, 1885), two volumes.

<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Because they were so successful in the Albany setting, 
      the Schuyler name permeates the community-based historical record. At the 
      same time, <a href="../../marriages.html">strategic marriages</a> of Schuyler 
      offspring makes them primary personages in the substantial scholarship focused 
      on the Van Cortlandt, Van Rensselaer, Livingston, and other elite early 
      New York families. <br>
