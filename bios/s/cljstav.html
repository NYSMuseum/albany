      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Claes Janse Stavast</strong></a> is <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=derekw&id=I3141">said</a> 
        to have been born in Kyunder, Overyssel, Holland during the first half 
        of the seventeenth century. He is thought to have emigrated to <a href="../../nnd.html">New 
        Netherland</a> with his brother, Gerrit Janse. They were in New Amsterdam 
        prior to the English takeover in 1664. However, his name does not appear 
        on the <a href="http://www.genealogy-quest.com/collections/nyoath.html">list</a> 
        of those who took the oath of allegience to the English in 1664. 
      <p>His wife was Eva (Aefje) Gerrits. They joined the Dutch church in New 
        Amsterdam in April 1664. Sometime thereafter, they left what became New 
        York and settled in Albany. 
      <p>In April 1676, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WBdCh9uazCQC&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=stavast+albany&source=bl&ots=lDfvBMc4nD&sig=3ZXixtDs-cHIMMssgzkxODFTpng&hl=en&ei=aWloS76RKcfT8Abw_sjABw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBIQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&q=stavast%20albany&f=false">purchased</a> 
        a house and lot located along the river from <a href="../a/chabeel112.html">Stoffel 
        Janse</a>. 
      <p>In November 1677, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=%22claes+janse+stavast%22&source=bl&ots=zBlUn1QymL&sig=dH-lDLQNMbhrjzaefhISZL6hP44&hl=en&ei=V99qS92WDcGn8AbpheX9BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22claes%20janse%20stavast%22&f=false">identified</a> 
        as a carpenter and litigant in an Albany court case. 
      <p>In March <a href="../../census1679.html#79">1679</a>, he was listed among 
        the Albany householders and was to be responsible for two rods of the 
        palisade <a href="../../map/map1676.html">fence</a>. 
      <p>In February <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1681bl">1681</a>, he was 
        among the Albany burghers who were solicited regarding the calling of 
        a new minister. 
      <p>In August 1684, he <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nkHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=stavast+albany&source=bl&ots=-hESn-M2AZ&sig=GsRTzEI7feiHepXAd2ecCJLs59o&hl=en&ei=c2VoS_rFApLM8QbcsuGtBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CAcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=stavast%20albany&f=false">sold</a> 
        the Albany house and lot to <a href="../vw/pivwog6050.html">Pieter Van 
        Woggelum</a>. 
      <p>The Stavasts are said to have returned to New York by 1682 when they 
        re-connected with the Dutch church there. In <a href="http://ancestralcurios.com/selyns_list_1686.htm">1686</a>, 
        Stavast and his wife were living on High Street in Manhattan.
<p>Claes Janse Stavast is said to have died in Albany in August 1687. Perhaps his daughter survived until the end of the century. One of their daughters married <a href="../b/dibensing7320.html">Dirck Bensing</a>. </p>
