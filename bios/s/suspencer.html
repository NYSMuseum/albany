<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Susannah Spencer</strong></a> was born in September 1729. She was the daughter of John Spencer and Mary Fry of Kent County, Rhode Island. She grew up as a younger daughter in a large Quaker family. Her mother died in 1732 when Susannah was not yet three.

<p>In October 1751, Susannah married Rhode Island Anabaptist <a href="jobstafford.html">Job Stafford</a>. By 1772, the marriage had produced ten children, seven of whom were born while the couple still lived in Rhode Island.

<p>By the late 1760s, these Staffords had joined a number of Rhode Island families in migrating to western Massachusetts. Job and Susannah settled in Cheshire where their last three children were born including their youngest, future Albany resident <a href="spstaff.html">Spencer Stafford</a>, who arrived in 1772.

<p>By the end of the war, these Staffords were on the move to New York and finally settled in Albany where Job operated a tavern and served as a land sale commissioner. They appear to have lived with Susannah's <a href="thspen.html">brother</a>. 

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources tell us that Susannah Spencer Stafford died in 1795. She had lived for sixty-six years. Her husband then moved in with a married daughter in <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> where he died in 1801.</p>
