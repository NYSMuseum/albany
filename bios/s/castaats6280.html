      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Staats</strong></a> was born in 
        January 1774. She was the daughter of Albany-area residents Barent J. 
        and Anna Winne <a href="staats.html">Staats</a>. She was an older daughter 
        in the large family of a prominent <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> 
        landholder. 
      <p>In January 1796, she married the somewhat older Albany native <a href="../b/huboyd7398.html">Hugh 
        Boyd</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Although 
        cut short by Boyd's untimely death, the marriage ultimately produced at 
        least ten children who were christened at the Dutch and Presbyterian churches. 
        Thru the 1790s, she was a pewholder at the Dutch church. 
      <p>These Boyds set up their <a href="../../census1800.html#7398">home</a> 
        near the waterfront on <a href="../../streets.html#dock">Dock Street</a>. 
        Catherine's husband was a merchant and mariner in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA57&lpg=PA47&dq=%22boyd+hugh%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22boyd%20hugh%22&f=false">partnership</a> 
        with other family members. 
      <p>However, by 1814, they had begun to sell off their Albany holdings and 
        to relocate to a 100-acre farm they had purchased from Staats family in 
        <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. 
      <p>In December 1816, Hugh Boyd had his family settled in Bethlehem when 
        he made out his <a href="../b/huboyd7398.html#will">will</a>. Catherine 
        was named co-executor and principal heir. Ten children plus the child 
        Catherine was carrying were provided for in the will. Hugh Boyd died on 
        December 29. 
      <p>In 1820 and 1830, her household was <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#sources">configured</a> 
        on the Bethlehem censuses. After that Catherine's name fell off the community-based 
        record. Perhaps she had moved in with one of her children - several of 
        whom became area residents. 
      <p>The Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#nn">newspaper</a> reported 
        that Catherine, the "widow of Capt. Hugh Boyd," had <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA304&lpg=PA304&dq=%22may 15&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=%22may 15&f=false">died</a> 
        in May 1840 at the age of sixty-seven. </p>
