<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Seeger</strong></a> was born in January 1726. He was the son of <a href="joseeger7002.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../w/brwheel.html">Bridget Wheeler</a> Seeger. He grew up in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> home of a career city <a href="../../corporation.html#retainers">r</a>etainer as a member of a large family that included several future Albany residents.

<p>In January 1748, he married Josina Wheeler at the Dutch church in her native <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. She died in September 1753 after giving birth to three children. In July 1757, widower Thomas married Judik <a href="../../res/sp.html">H</a>ogland also in Kinderhook. That marriage added three more children to their combined family. His second wife died in 1791.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1761">1761</a>, he was named constable for the first ward. He seems to have served in that capacity for several years until <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a> when he officially succeeded Johannes Seeger as city marshall. He had been compensated for services several times prior to his actual appointment. He may have served in that <a href="../../corporation.html#marshall">post</a> for more than a decade. Like his father, this individual was a lifelong Albany resident and employee of the city <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>.

<p>During the mid-1760s, his first ward property was accorded a modest <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7008">1779</a>, only his real property holdings in the first ward were considered on the city tax rolls.

<p>Fifty years old in 1776, during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he seems to have served the revolutionary cause in a capacity similar to the job of the city marshall - a position he seemed to have retained throughout the war years. However, his name has not been found on other wartime rolls. A younger, same-named nephew is <a href="http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/gen/report/rr16/rr16_469.html">said</a> to have died in 1778 while serving in the Revolutionary army.



<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#7008">1790</a>, Thomas Seeger's first ward household included two men and five females. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his "house and lots" was located in a <a href="../../loc/southend.html">mar</a>ginal area near the southern <a href="../../citylimits.html">city line</a>.

At that point, the name of Thomas Seeger leaves the <a href="../../cbr.html">mainline roll</a> - except for the city <a href="../../poor.html">poor list</a> where he received regular sums for a number of years. Seeger had admitted to poverty as early as <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_q8RzVdmgyMC&pg=PA321&lpg=PA321&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false">September 1788</a> when he was unable to pay rents due to the city. In December 1794, the city  government ordered that his lot be re-possessed and leased to someone else as Seeger is "not only insolvent, but treats the board with ridicule and contempt." Entries on a number of subsequent poor lists followed. 

<p>Thomas Seeger filed a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> on March 1, 1809. It ordered payment of all his bills and then left his property and belongings to his two married daughters. He died a few days later at the age of eighty-four. The newspaper notice read that he  "was for many years public crier and crier of courts held in the city." The will passed probate in early April.</p>
