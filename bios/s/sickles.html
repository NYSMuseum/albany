        family of early Albany is descendant from <a href="zasickles5648.html">Zacharias 
        Sickles</a> who is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have accompanied 
        Governor Stuyvesant from Curacao to New Amsterdam. During the 1660s, he 
        was at <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> when he married 
        Albany native Anna Van Valkenburgh. They raised a large family. Some of 
        their descendants became Albany residents.

<p>During the first half of the eighteenth century, the family name was only occasionally seen in the community-based record. In other words, we seek connections between the first Zachariah Sickles and the <a href="zasickles7066.html">Zachariah</a> who lived in Albany during the era of the American Revolution.
		 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html">1779</a>, two Sickles-named men owned residential property within the city limits.
 
<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">1781</a>, merchant <a href="thsickles7062.html">Thomas 
        Sickles</a> was among the non native residents who purchased the "freedom 
        of the city." Although he lived in Albany for about a decade, he does 
        not seem to have been closely related to the mainline Albany Sickles family. 
		
<p>Following the War for Independence, <a href="zasickles7066.html">Zachariah 
        Sickles</a> was among those awarded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#sic">land 
        bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        regiment. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, only the Watervliet home 
        of <a href="absickles7030.html">Abraham Sickles</a> appeared on the Albany census.
		 
      <p>By <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a>, four Sickles-named households 
        were included on the Albany city census. 
      <p>Three Sickles-named households were listed in the first Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city 
        directory</a> in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA87,M1">1813</a>. 
        One was a baker and another a shoemaker.</p>
      <p>By the end (25 Sickles-named households in NYS in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>) 
        of the eighteenth century, the Sickles family had become established in 
        many New York counties. Three generations later, the descendants of Zacharias 
        Sickles had spread <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~txccmdrt/vansickle_benjamin.htm">across</a> 
        the United States.</p>
