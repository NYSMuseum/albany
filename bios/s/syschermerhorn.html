<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Symon Schermerhorn</strong></a> was born during the late 1650s. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="jajscher5448.html">Jacob Janse</a> and Jannetie Egmont Schermerhorn. We have retained the frequently encountered <a href="../../res/sp.html">sp</a>elling "Symon" when referring to this legendary character. Symon grew up in a large family in the home of a prominent Beverwyck/Albany businessman, real estate trader, and then <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> patentee. 

<p>As his father became more established and identified with the new settlement in the Mohawk Valley, Symon probably became the principal resident of his father's Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#5448">house</a> on Pearl Street.
 

<p>By 1683, he had married Albany native <a href="../v/wiviele6788.html">Willempie Viele</a>. By 1695, the marriage had produced four children - the last two were christened in New York. During the 1680s, he was a member and regular baptism sponsor at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In 1687, he was among the Albany area merchants who petitioned the governor of the province.

<p>In May 1688, his father's <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">will</a> noted that Symon lived in a house next to that of <a href="../d/jodewan6162.html">Johannes De Wandelaer</a> (in Albany). He was scheduled to receive a share (nine surviving children) of the estate and to join his older <a href="rjscher5490.html">brother</a> in assisting their mother in the administration of Jacob Janse's substantial assets.

<p>During the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenectady_massacre">attack</a> on Schenectady on the evening of February 9, 1690, his name became emblazoned in <a href="https://archive.org/details/symonschermerhoo00swen">local lore</a> when, although wounded himself, he is <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/09.html">said</a>         to have ridden to Albany by way of <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a> to warn the settlers of the disaster. His son and three slaves are said to have been killed during the attack. His father died about that time as well.

<p>Sometime in 1691, he is said to have removed his family to New York City where he died about 1695 or 1696. During the 1690s, he transported cargoes on the <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">Hudson</a> between New York and Albany. His widow remarried in 1699, returned to Albany, and bore more children.</p>
