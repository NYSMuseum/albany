<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Margaret Fowler</strong></a> was the wife of <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> businessman <a href="../f/wmfowler.html">William Fowler</a>. We <a href="../../res/guess.html">expect</a> that she was the daughter of Albany resident <a href="samstevenson.html">Samuel Stevenson</a> family and was born during the 1770s. She probably lived most of her life in Albany. However, potential Stevenson parents present a number of <a href="../qqqq.html">possibilities</a> including that she was not from the Albany family founded by <a href="jastevenson3901.html">James Stevenson</a> a half century earlier. 

<p>Margaret is said to have married William Fowler in 1796. Their son, "Samuel Stevenson Fowler," was christened in Albany in 1799. Another <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BqdVAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA3-PA23&lpg=RA3-PA23&dq=%22margaret+stevenson%22+fowler+albany&source=bl&ots=Ne3pt3YzA8&sig=IWtuR_iZ95fdZQu0XeLUcBl1JZY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Tri7T7_EEcmZ6QH5g83NCw&sqi=2&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22margaret%20stevenson%22%20fowler%20albany&f=false">son</a> became a prominent cleric. In August 1818, their daughter became the first wife of jurist <a href="../f/safoote.html">Samuel A. Foote</a>. Another son (William) died in 1823. These Fowlers were members of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>Mrs. Margaret Fowler's home was listed in the city directories beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=%22fowler+william%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22fowler%20william%22&f=false">1813</a>, at 33 <a href="../../streets.html#court">Court</a> (later 409 South Market) Street.

<p>During the early 1800s, William and Margaret were involved in a number of transactions regarding Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>. 

<p>Margaret Fowler died in January 1852. The newspaper <a href="http://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany04munsuoft#page/346/mode/2up/search/fowler">noted</a> she had lived 76 years. Her husband survived until 1861.</p>
