<strong>Coenradt Sharp</strong></a> (often <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelled</a> "Scherp")  was born in September 1738. He was the son of Jurrian and Barbara Sharp. His parents were residents of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">East Manor</a> and were still alive into the 1770s. He does not appear to be connected to the family of his troubled Albany contemporary <a href="jasharp.html">Jacobus Sharp</a>.

<p>His wife was <a href="elstaats.html">Elizabeth Staats</a> - although we have yet to connect her to the core Albany <a href="staats.html">Staats</a> family. However, between 1776 and 1790, four of their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>During the 1770s, he would have been in his thirties and seems to have been in the Albany area as he signed a community-based <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779pe">petition</a> asking for leniency for a local thief. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7010">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> more definitive information regarding his wartime activities.

<p>In 1781, he was among a number of non native-born <a href="../../newcomers.html">new</a>comers who <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7010">purchased</a> the right to do business in Albany called "Freedom of the City." At that time, he was identified as a merchant. 

<p>In October 1782, he was one of a number of area residents who witnessed the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&printsec=frontcover&dq#PPA44,M1">will</a> of the <a href="../t/anmgte4836.html">widow</a> of former mayor John Barclay.

<p>In 1782, he was appointed chimney viewer for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.  A few years later, his moderate <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7010">holdings</a> first appeared on a city assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7010">1790,</a> the first census showed seven people in his houshold. Subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#7010">censuses</a> documented the growth of his mid-sized family in the house on the west side of <a href="../../im\immktstcol.html">North Market Street</a>. This mainliner was known in the city as a tobacconist in a career that spanned three decades.

<p>Coenradt Sharp was dead by July 14,1812 when his will passed probate. He would have been about seventy-four years old at the time. The house of the "widow of Coenradt Sharp" on <a href="../../streets.html#patroon">Patroon Street</a> was included in the city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a> in 1816.
