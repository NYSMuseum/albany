<P><a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Slingerland-3">Fa</a>mily-based resources tell us that <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneer <a href="#sources"><strong>Teunis Cornelise</strong></a> was born in Amsterdam, Holland in April 1617. <a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referenced variously, he was the patriarch of the Slingerland family of early Albany and its environs. We seek defining information on his specific <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to New Netherland/Albany.

 
     
<p>By 1658, he had taken title to the house and lot in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> where he then was living. In <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#5439">1660</a>, his name appeared on a petition of <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur traders</a> operating from the Beverwyck area. He also kept a house in New Amsterdam.

<p>In 1677, he leased a farm on the Normanskill from the <a href="../b/bradt.html">Bradt</a> family. By that time, he had married mill owner's daughter <a href="../b/enbradt4185.html">Engeltie Bradt</a>. The marriage produced at least four children prior to her death in 1683. In March 1684, he purchased a large <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/hmgfm/slingerland-1.html">tract</a> of land in what are now the towns of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> and New Scotland. 

<p>In April 1684, he married the widow <a href="../f/geerfonda.html">Geertie Fonda Bekker</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a <a href="../../lists/list1683ssl.html#5439">member</a> and known as "Teunis Cornelisz" and also as "Teunis (and Antoni) Slingerlunt". A number of children may have resulted from his second marriage.

<p>Although he appeared to have held considerable properties south of Albany, he maintained his Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#125">identity</a> for many years.

<p>In 1694, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willgerygerr.html">will</a> of an Albany neighbor. After that time, his name appears to have dropped from Albany rolls.

<p>Family-based resources <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Slingerland-3">hold</a> that Teunis C. Slingerland <a href="../qqqq.html">died</a> in Hackensack, New Jersey after May 1700. Past diminishing returns, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now!</p>
