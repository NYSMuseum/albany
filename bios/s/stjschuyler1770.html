<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Stephen Schuyler</B></A> was born in August 
            1737. He was the eighth child (and the third christened Stephanus/Stevanus) 
            of Albany businessman <a href="joschuyler1428.html">Johannes</a> 
            and <a href="../vc/covcortlandt6662.html">Cornelia Van Cortlandt</a> 
            Schuyler. He was the younger brother of General <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
            Schuyler</a>.</p> 

          <p>A few years after his birth, Johannes Schuyler's family moved out to the family 
            farm at <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Schuyler Flats</a>. 
            Athough his father died in 1741, that Hudson River estate would be 
            young Stephen's home base for the remainder of his life.</p>

          <p>With the death of his mother in 1762, Stephen had accumulated a substantial 
            <a href="../../wills/willcovcortlandt6662.html">inheritance</a> including land at the Flats, in Albany city, a sizeable 
            portion of the downriver Van Cortlandt estate, and lands in Saratoga 
            and elsewhere. The next year, the twenty-six-year-old landholder married 
            seventeen-year-old <a href="../t/lete4874.html">Lena Ten Eyck</a> 
            - daughter of an Albany merchant. A few months later, the first of 
            their ten children was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> where both parents were members.</P>

          <p>Although Stephen had given his occupation at "brewer" at the time 
            of his marriage, this wealthy legatee is best characterized as a landholder. 
            By the mid-1760s, he was managing his property from <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">the 
            Flats</a> - a larger family complex then under the jurisdiction of 
            his aging aunt, Margarita Schuyler. Living in the countryside, he 
            began selling off his Albany property - finally conveying the State 
            Street <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">homestead</a> to Henry 
            Staats in 1777.</p>

<p>He was known as a military figure. In 1755, he was an eighteen-year-old lieutenant in the Rensselaerswyck company of the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany County militia</a>. In 1760, he was commissioned a captain of militia and was empowered to offer a bounty for enlistments. He served on the Mohawk frontier.</p>

          <p>The outbreak of hostilities in 1775 found Stephen J. Schuyler serving as colonel 
            of the sixth regiment of the Albany County Militia. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a></p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1770">1790</a>, his Watervliet farm included nine slaves.</p>

<p>Stephen J. Schuyler died in December of 1820 at age seventy-two.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Stephen J. Schuyler</B> is CAP 
            <A  href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 1770. He was named for 
            his maternal grandfather, Stephanus Van Cortlandt. He was known as 
            Stephen J. Schuyler to prevent confusion with his more Albany-based 
            cousin, Stephen P. Schuyler. This profile is derived chiefly from 
            <a href="../../sources.html#csg">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
            resources</a>.</p>
