<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"><b>Gideon Schaets</b></a> was born in South Holland in 1607 or 1608. He is <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2005-01/1105730314">said</a> to have been the son of 
Rev. Bartholomeus Schaets and his first wife Anneke Blom Schaets. The marriage produced additional children who survived to maturity.</p>

<p>Gideon was educated chiefly by his father to become a schoolteacher and tutor. In 1634, he married Agnietje Moens/Moriaens - a governess. The marriage produced several children. These educators opened and ran a small school for a dozen years. Sometime later, he began to study for the ministry.

<p>In May 1652, he was ordained in the Dutch Reformed Church. In that year, he accepted a call to replace <a href="../m/jomeg.html">Johannes Megapolensis</a> in the <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> serving <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and Beverwyck. His first wife probably remained in Holland. Domine Schaets landed in New Netherland in July with two sons and a daughter. His first wife, Agnietie, is said to have died in 1666.</p>

<p>He moved his family into a house in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> provided by Governor Stuyvesant and successfully served several terms as minister in Albany. The new church was built in Albany under his auspices. He also acted as a missionary to the Indians and, from time to time, supplied services to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and Kingston as well.</p>

<p>Translations of material relating to his clerical contract have been printed as <i><a href="../../guide/histres.html#eccr">Ecc</a>lesiastical Records of the State of New York</i> in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=i6IlAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309&dq=%22gideon+schaets%22&source=bl&ots=qb-0_dCFhv&sig=onSAT22UVK8dCxs9c77yysgjkEI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=H5EdVPiUKcWuyAT61IKoDA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22gideon%20schaets%22&f=false">volume I</a>.

<p>In July 1658, his house and garden in Beverwyck were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=DShVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA38&dq=1658+garden+scaets&hl=en&sa=X&ei=QuceVLz9K4SjyATTioH4Dw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=1658%20garden%20scaets&f=false">ref</a>erenced in a property transaction.

<p>His property was not among those enumerated in a census of Albany householders taken in <a href="../../census1679.html">1679</a>.

<p>In 1683, he was joined by a much younger <a href="../d/godellius.html">Godfredius Dellius</a> although he continued to preach until his death. In 1683, he married the widow <a href="../h/bahendricks.html">Barentie Hendricks</a>. He then would have been 76 years old and was said to be "very feeble!" However, his second wife died. Her <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+7#v=onepage&q=schaets&f=false">will presented for probate</a> in December 1688 bequeathed her house to Schaets.</p>

<p>Domine Gideon Schaets died in February 1694 and was buried beneath the church. Living for more than eighty-seven years, his life spanned almost the entire seventeenth century.</p>
