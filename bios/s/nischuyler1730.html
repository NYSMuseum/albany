<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Schuyler</strong></a> was born in September 1691 and christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in New York City. He was the only susrviving son of <a href="phphschuyler.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../d/eldemeyer.html">Elizabeth De Meyer</a> Schuyler of New York City.

<p>In 1711, he accompanied his uncle, <a href="pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a>, on an expedition to the Onondaga country. His mother died in 1712.

<p>In December 1714, he married Albany native <a href="../w/elswendell2799.html">Elsie Wendell</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By, 1733, the marriage had produced eight children. His wife died in 1744 and he is said to have married <a href="mastevenson.html">Mary</a>, the sister of upwardly mobile Albany newcomer <a href="jastevenson3901.html">James Stevenson</a>. In his fifties, the marriage would have been childless. 

<p>Following his first marriage, he settled in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        where he was known as a <a href="../../trades/sur.html">surveyor</a>. 
        However, he returned to the Indian country to <a href="../../furtrade.html">trade</a> 
        but found himself in trouble with provincial authorities for trading to 
        Canada. Later, he would be called <a href="../../trades/medical.html">D</a>octor. 
      <p>In 1727, he was chosen to represent Schenectady in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>. 
      <p>He later was employed as an engineer and was involved with the building 
        of Fort Clinton at Old Saratoga. 
      <p>Nicholas Schuyler filed a will in May 1746. He called himself a "gentleman 
        of Schenectady" and named his second wife and seven living children as 
        his heirs. He died in July 1748 and was buried from his church. His <a href="#bible">family 
        bible</a> contains a wealth of information. </p>
