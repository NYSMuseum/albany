              Schuyler</B></A> was born in November 1733. He was the sixth child 
              (and eldest surviving son) of <a href="joschuyler1428.html">Johannes</a> 
              and <a href="../vc/covcortlandt6662.html">Cornelia Van Cortlandt</a> 
              Schuyler. He grew up at the <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler 
              house</a> in Albany and on the family farm at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flats</a>.</p>
            <p>Losing his father on the eve of his seventh birthday and several 
              uncles during the 1740s as well, the boy grew up with his younger 
              brothers and was schooled at home. In 1748 he was sent to New Rochelle 
              to be educated by Peter Stouppe - a French Protestant minister. 
              By that time, he was being groomed to take over family leadership 
              in the years to come. Returning home in 1751, Philip began to show 
              symptoms of the gout and pleuresy that would plague him for the 
              rest of his life. But that summer, he undertook a traditional rite 
              of passage with a trip into the Mohawk country to experience the 
              <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian trade.</a></p>
            <p>During that decade he was counselled by and learned from two early 
              American icons, his aunt Margarita Schuyler - who lived at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flats</a>, 
              and <a href="../b/jobradstreet.html">John Bradstreet</a> - a British 
              officer in Albany to procure supplies and transport them to the 
              frontier.</p>
            <p>In September 1755, twenty-one-year-old Philip married <a href="../vr/cavr.html">Catherine 
              Van Rensselaer</a>, daughter of the Lower or Claverack manor. A 
              few months later the first of their fifteen children was baptized 
              in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - where 
              both parents were prominent members. At that time, they were living 
              with his mother in the large and rambling <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler 
              house</a> at Albany's <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">main 
              intersection</a>.</P>
            <p>In 1755, Philip was commissioned a Captain and empowered to raise 
              a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company that would 
              build fortifications north of Albany. In 1756, he accompanied Bradstreet 
              to Oswego where he learned the business of military supply and also 
              experienced disillusionment when that outpost fell to the French.</p>
            <p>Back home in Albany, in 1756 Schuyler was elected to the <a href="../../corporation.html">common 
              council</a> as assistant alderman for the first ward and was able 
              to obtain the contract to operate the ferry that connected Albany 
              with Greenbush. He also held a provincial appointment as commissioner 
              of the excise (import tax) and procured supplies and provisions 
              for Bradstreet as well.</P>
            <p>Philip Schuyler returned to active service. As an officer in the 
              British supply train, he took part in attack on Ticonderoga and 
              in Bradstreet's capture of Fort Frontenac. Stationed for the most 
              part at Albany, he served in Bradstreet's quartermaster's department 
              for the remainder of the war.</p>
            <p>By 1761, he had begun to gather resources that would enable him 
              to build his own landed estate south of the <a href="../../loc/beaverkill.html">Beaverkill</a> 
              that became <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a>. 
              But in March, Schuyler went to England to broker settlement of Bradstreet's 
              quartermaster's accounts leaving his mentor with the Schuyler family 
              and in charge of the actual construction of his new home. When he 
              returned to Albany at the end of 1762, he found John Bradstreet 
              living with his family in his new Georgian mansion.</p>
            <p>Philip Schuyler was elected to the New York <a href="../../org/ass.html">General 
              Assembly</a> in 1768. He served until that colonial body disbanded 
              and was replaced by an extra-legal Provincial Congress in 1775. 
              It was in the Assembly that Philip Schuyler began to emerge as a 
              leader of the opposition to <a href="../../7yw.html">post-war</a> 
              British restrictions and strictures.</p>
            <p>During that time, his business involved the harvesting of farm 
              and forest products on his extensive Hudson Valley estates and shipping 
              them to New York on his own sloops and schooner. Trading on his 
              inherited real estate and family credit, by the eve of the Revolution, 
              the forty-three-year-old American had emerged as one of the wealthiest 
              landholders in the region. However, his success rested on already 
              functional estates that needed more independent access to markets 
              and resources to develop further. Thus, he had little trouble supporting 
              the resistance activities that eventually made colonists into revolutionaries!</p>
            <p>In June 1775, he was appointed one of the four Major Generals of 
              the Continental army by the Continental Congress. He served until 
              he was replaced in 1777 and finally resigned his commission in April 
              1779. He then returned to the Continental Congress. <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a></p>
            <p>He was selected to the New York State Senate in 1780 and was appointed 
              one of the first two United States Senators for New York in 1788. 
              He served until 1791 and later from 1797 to January 1798 when another 
              attack of gout forced him to resign. &nbsp; <a href="../../inprog.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=10 height=10 alt="PAGE IN PROGRESS"></a></p>
            <p>In 1790, Schuyler Mansion was configured on the first ward <a href="../../census1790.html#1750">census</a> 
              with eight family members and thirteen slaves. A decade later, his 
              <a href="../../census1800.html#1750">household</a>, still included 
              eleven slaves. 
<p>In June 1803, this Philip Schuyler <a href="#will">filed</a> his will. He died on November 18, 1804 and was buried in the Ten Broeck family vault. Later, his remains were removed to Albany Rural Cemetery and a large monument was erected that stands today. His <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1750.html">will</a> divided an extensive estate among his many heirs.</p>

<p><a href="#lazarus"><img src="../../images/jpg/schuyler.jpg" border=1 align=left width=170  height=181 vspace=6 hspace=6 alt="Lazarus portrait hangs in Schuyler Mansion"></a>General Philip Schuyler was the most notable son of the most important early Albany <a href="../../familynames.html">family!</a> He also was one of the wealthiest community residents with extensive client lists in Albany and throughout the region. He probably was the only Albany native of his day with a reputation beyond the region. However, he only held one Albany municipal office and much of his business was conducted beyond/away from the mainstream Albany commerical establishment. Much of his achievement was beyond the confines of his birthplace. That said, <a href="#many">many things</a> in the community today commemorate his life. Because so much community iconography is focused on him, Philip Schuyler is one of the most-recalled figures in early Albany history. Although               his papers are scattered, they are voluminous and his life has been closely interpreted by several generations of historians. In the process, his story has been mixed (made interchangeable) with that of his home town. Our task is to place "the General" in his proper Albany context and not let his interesting, significant, and largely beyond Albany careers speak for the more complex  stories of the growth and development of this early American city!</p>

              <A name=biography></a> The life of this <B>Philip <a href="schuyler.html">Schuyler</a></B> is 
              CAP <A  href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 1750. He has been 
              the subject of much more study and biographical scholarship than 
              anyone else who lived in the early Albany community. The most substantial 
              works are Don R. Gerlach, <i>Philip Schuyler and the American Revolution 
              in New York, 1733</i> (Lincoln, NE, 1964), which comprehended all 
              previous work and is an essential starting point for any understanding 
              of the Schuyler family and its most famous son. Gerlach's second 
              volume, <i>Proud Patriot: Philip Schuyler and the War for Independence, 
              1775-1783</i>, was published by Syracuse University Press in 1987. 
              It is an exhaustive chronicle of the critical period of Schuyler's 
              life. <a href="../../sources.html#csg"><i>Christoph's Schuyler Genealogy</i></a> 
              is an indispensible family-based resource.

<p>The ultimate intent of <a href="phschuyler1750.html">this biography</a> 
              is to place a great man in his local context and to leave his out-of-Albany 
              career in the able hands of Don Gerlach and others. This will be 
              a daunting task because Philip Schuyler rarely held Albany offices 
              and was not among its major city-based businessmen. We will <a href="../../inprog.html">come 
              to terms</a> with this outstanding native son in the future.
