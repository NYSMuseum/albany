<P>
Albany resident <a href="#sources">
<strong>Zachariah Sickles</strong></a> was born before 1755. We believe his same-named <a href="sickles.html">ancestors</a> were Albany residents at one time. A <a href="../../res/sp.html">number</a> of men named Zachariah Sickles lived in the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">region</a> and beyond during the second half of the eighteenth century.

<p>This individual seems to have <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">appeared</a> on the Albany community landscape during the mid-1770s. Family business, wartime flight, or military service would be likely reasons for his coming to Albany.

<p>In June 1777, he married Catharina Sheers (<a href="../../res/sp.html">S</a>ears) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1793, four <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ydgRAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA165&lpg=#v=onepage&q=&f=false">children</a> had been christened there. In 1786, he supported funding for a second minister at the Albany church.

<p>In August 1778, his name appeared on a <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html#7066">roster</a> of tradesmen and artifacers employed by the Quartermaster General at Albany. He was identified as the "storekeeper." His <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">service</a> to the revolutionary cause qualified him for a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#sic">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. A number of additional service senarios for this named individual are available.

<p>In 1778, he <a href="../../doc/petbenrogers.html">signed</a> at least two community-based petitions addressed to the governor. In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7066">1779</a>, his third ward real property was valued on the Albany assessment roll. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1779tl">October</a> of that year, his holdings were listed twice - perhaps encompassing three total parcels.

<p>In January 1783, local newspapers advertized various items he had for sale "Near the Dutch church." The advertisement noted that he offered "A general assortment of DRY GOODS; Variety of elegant Calicoes and Chintzes; German and Common Steel, Iron Potts and Kettels, Spirts [sic] (Jamaica) and W.I. Rum. Cash Morris's, Bank Depreciation, or Pickering's Notes, Contractors Due Bills, or Country Produce, Highest Price in Cash for Wheat." 

<p>However, his name did not appear on the city assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html">1788</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, six <a href="../../res/sp.html">Z</a>achariahs were listed on the first Federal census of heads of households in New York State - none in 
Albany or Watervliet. But, by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his <a  href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> property was valued on the Albany assessment roll. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7066">1800</a> and in 1810, his third ward household was configured on the Albany census. Assessment rolls from those years valued his Dock Street property modestly. 

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22sickles,+zachariah%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22sickles,%20zachariah%22&f=false">1813</a> and afterwards, he was listed in the city directories as a shoemaker at 8 <a href="../../streets.html#dock">Dock</a> Street.

<p>After the early 1820s, his name no longer appeared in Albany city directories. At this point, we cannot say whether this individual simply passed on or whether he removed from Albany.  

<p>A Zachariah Sickles <a href="http://surnamearchive.com/records/records104.htm">died</a> 15 Jun 1839 at Chittenango NY at the age of 92. He was called a Revolutionary War soldier.
