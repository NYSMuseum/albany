<strong>Elizabeth Schermerhorn</strong></a> was born in February 1707. She was the daughter of <a href="coscher5455.html">Cornelis J.</a> and his first wife, Maria Van Buren Schermerhorn. Her father was a businessman and sloop captain. Her mother died and Cornelis Janse re-married. By the 1720s, he had relocated his large, combined family to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>.

<p>In April 1728, Elizabeth married <a href="../b/mibassett7257.html">Michael Bassett</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1750, eleven children had been christened at the Albany church where she was a pewholder and occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>These Bassetts lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> - perhaps in a house recently vacated by her out-migrating father. Michael Bassett was a <a href="../../census1756.html#157">gunsmith</a> and Albany mainstay for more than four decades.

<p>Elizabeth Schermerhorn Bassett may have been dead when her husband passed on in 1785. If not, she may have lived with her eldest <a href="../../census1790.html#mb">son</a> in a Watervliet <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">home</a>.</p>
