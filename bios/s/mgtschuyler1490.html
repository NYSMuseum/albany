<P><a href="#sources"><b>Margaret Schuyler</b></a> was born in September 1758. She was the daughter of <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../vr/cavr.html">Catharina Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler. Daughter of two of the most successful <a href="../../albanycounty.html">regional</a> families, she grew up in Albany and on family <a href="../../im/im1767.html">countryside</a> retreats. In 1774, she was left a bequest in the <a href="../../wills/willjobradstreet.html">will</a> of Colonel John Bradstreet - a friend of her family.</p>


<p>In June 1783, she married <a href="../vr/svr3.html">Stephen Van Rensselaer, III</a>. He was nineteen. She was a few months shy of her twenty-fifth birthday. The marriage occasioned conflicting analyses - one source calling it an elopement and everyone agreeing that he was "far too young" for such a connection. Most agreed, however, that "Miss Peggy" was a "charming young woman and destined to further distinction." In any event, at age twenty-one, he assumed the title of "Lord of Van Rensselaer Manor." By 1789, the marriage produced three children who were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Only their son survived to reach maturity!</p>

<p>After a year in Albany, the patroon's young family made their home at the Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a> - living on a large estate attended by <a href="../../census1790.html#svr3">many servants</a>. Stephen Van Renssleaer became one of the most important public figures in early nineteenth century New York State.</p>

<p>These Van Rensselaers were frequent guests at the New York home of Margaret's sister, <a href="esh.html">Elizabeth Schuyler</a> Hamilton where their social circle included President Washington and other American leaders.</p> 

<p>Margaret Schuyler Van Rensselaer died in March 1801. Dead before her forty-third birthday, her mother's <a href="../../fhg.html#mgh">biographer</a> called her "bright, spirited and generous." Her grand funeral at the Manor House masked the family's grief over her untimely passing. The still-young patroon re-married in May 1802!</p>
