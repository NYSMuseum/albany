<P>Perhaps the future Albany resident  <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Snyder</strong></a> was <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~geneals/snyder.htm">born</a> in New Jersey in 1742. Because a number of similarly <a href="../../res/sp.html">named</a> contemporaries are <a href="../qqqq.html">at risk</a>, we seek to focus on the Albany resident whose daughter married young <a href="../h/pahog.html">P</a>aul Hogstrasser.

<p>William Snyder was married and the father of a number of children. At one time, he was a member of the Albany Medthodist Episcopal church.

<p>In 1767, he was a lieutenant in John M. Veeder's Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. At that time, the only <a href="../../sources.html#uny">references</a> to William Snyder <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> "Schneider" were in the southeastern parts of Albany County.


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2597">1790</a>, the household of William Snyder was listed on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and personal property in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> were valued moderately. Also valued under the property was the personal estate of <a href="../h/pahog.html">Paul Hogstrasser</a>.

<p>During the early 1800s, he was identified as a merchant and also the city treasury paid for a grocer's license.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#2597">1800</a>, his household included eight people. By that time, the Hogstrassers (Paul and Catherine Snyder) had established their own <a href="../../census1800.html#8495">home</a> nearby. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, his storehouse and large lot on <a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay Street</a> was valued on the third ward assessment roll.

<p>After that, Snyder appears to have left the city to operate what became a landmark <a href="http://www.grooms-tavern.org/Grooms_Tavern_history.htm">store</a> on today's Grooms Road in recently established Saratoga County.

<p>Beginning in 1815, the residence of a "William Snyder" was <a href="../qqqq.html">listed</a> in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 166 North Market Street. 

<p>William Snyder is said to have died in Schenectady in 1826. Perhaps his obituary appeared in a Utica newspaper for September 21, 1826 <a href="http://surnamearchive.com/records/records104.htm">stating</a> that he "fought in <a href="../../7yw.html">Fr</a>ench and Indian War, one of the oldest residents of Albany; en route home from Utica he died when he fell from a canal boat." The funeral was held the next day at his son's North Market Street home. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">Letters</a> of Administration on his estate were issued in Albany in October.</p>
