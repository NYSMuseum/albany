      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac Staats</b></a> was born in July 1701. He 
        was the son of Albany residents <a href="jostaats4558.html">Joachim</a> 
        and Anna Rynders Staats. His mother died shortly thereafter and Joachim 
        Staats re-married. Isaac also lost his father in 1712 when the boy was 
        eleven years old.</p>
      <p>In June 1728, he married Albany native <a href="../vd/mavdu5554.html">Maria 
        Van Deusen</a>. By 1741, six children had been christened at the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
      <p>Isaac Staats was a <a href="../../census1756.html#86">cooper</a> who 
        lived in Albany's first ward. In 1732, he served as firemaster. In 1749, 
        he was elected alderman. His name appeared on Albany freeholder <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#4592">lists</a> 
        and his holdings on <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">ass</a>essment 
        rolls. By the mid-1760s, he was listed on the latter with his sons, <a href="bastaats4564.html">Barent</a>, 
        <a href="wmstaats4561.html">Willem</a>, and <a href="hestaats4587.html">Henry</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1765, he sought to have his father's will, that was made more than 
        fifty years earlier, probated. That <a href="../../inprog.html">complicated 
        process</a> is further described in a number of sources.</p>
      <p>In 1775, he contributed for the relief of Ticonderoga. After that, his 
        name dropped from community records.</p>
