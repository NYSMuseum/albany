      <P>According to subsequent <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~twintiers/revsoldsick.html">records</a>, 
        <strong>Thomas Sickles</strong> was born in February 1749 and probably 
        in New Jersey. He does not seem to have been closely connected to the 
        Albany <a href="sickles.html">Sickles</a> family. 
      <p>In July 1777, he <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/nj/statewide/vitals/marriages/marrindx06.txt">marr</a>ied 
        Mary Norwood of/in Princeton, New Jersey. The couple appear to have had 
        a large family (<a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/sickles/messages/776.html">11 
        children</a>). Their first son is said to have been born in Albany in 
        September 1778 - and subsequently was christened in New Jersey. In 1780 
        and 1782, sons were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. Two of his sons were buried in the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Pres</a>byterian 
        church cellar in 1783 and 1785. 
      <p>He is <a href="http://genforum.genealogy.com/sickles/messages/774.html">said</a> 
        to have come to Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war</a>. 
        He appears to have been an <a href="http://www.njstatelib.org/NJ_Information/Searchable_Publications/reg/NJREGn29.html">officer</a> 
        in a New Jersey regiment of the Continental army. In March 1778, he <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;q1=sickles;rgn=full%20text;idno=ABP1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000961">reported</a> 
        to the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committee</a> that two Albany-area 
        men refused to deliver wood to the military magazine. In August of that 
        year, his name appeared above a <a href="../../doc/1778qmg.html">roster</a> 
        of those local tradesmen under the command of the Quartermaster General. 
        He was identified as Assistant Quartermaster General. 
      <p>In March <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#7062">1779</a>, his property 
        in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> was valued on the Albany 
        assessment roll. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html#7062">1781</a>, his name was on 
        a list of Albany newcomers who had purchased the "Freedom" of the city. 
        At that time, he was identified as a merchant. 
      <p>In September 1784, he was advertizing the sale of "European & India goods" 
        on the south side of State Street in the Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=kpUMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+sickles%22#PPA196,M1">newspaper</a>. 
        Within a year, he seems to have left Albany for its hinterland. 
      <p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=E3sFAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA304&lpg=PA304&dq=%22thomas+sickles%22&source=bl&ots=fs_SRYEEIc&sig=SiW284z2XI4RlaOqGdiXG76vjcU&hl=en&ei=7QA5StqHBofoNNy8iY4N&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2">1786</a>, 
        he was a <a href="http://politicalgraveyard.com/bio/siaca-siewert.html#SICKLES">member</a> 
        of the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> from Albany 
        and then Rensselaer County. He served until 1794. 
      <p>In May 1789, he was appointed assistant judge for Albany County. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, 
        his large household (13 family members) was configured on the census for 
        the town of Hoosick which was still in old <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany 
        County</a>. He is <a href="http://www.hoosickhistory.com/shortstories/walloomsacmills.htm">said</a> 
        to have been an early settler (of what was once called "Sickles Mills) 
        whose farm and cloth mill were near the Wallomsac River. 
      <p>Thomas Sickles died in Herkimer County in April 1811 and was <a href="http://herkimer.nygenweb.net/cemeteries/citycem2.html">buried</a> 
        in the Herkimer cemetery. His survivors <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~twintiers/revsoldsick.html">later</a> 
        received a <a href="../../or/pension/penthsickles7062.html">pension</a> 
        for his service during the Revolutionary war. His widow died in 1840.</p>
