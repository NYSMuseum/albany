<strong>Ziba Swan</strong></a> was born in New London, Connecticut in November 1767. He was the eldest son and second child in the large family of <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~dantrogers/pafg3414.htm#68365C">Jesse</a> and Elizabeth Allen or <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/jcrossley/wc/wc74/wc74_256.htm">B</a>aldwin Swan. Perhaps his <a href="http://www.ckls.org/~jswan/swandesc3.htm">father</a> was the Jesse Swan who relocated to Albany County following the christening of his last child in Connecticut in 1787. His father owned or leased a <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079l_m_z.htm">farm</a> in the Heldeberghs  and died in Berne in 1803.

<p>In July 1790, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WRE0O8?ie=UTF8&tag=surnamefinder-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000WRE0O8">Z</a>iba married Elizabeth Palmer in New London. Their first child was born earlier that month. By the end of 1796, at least three more children were born in Connecticut.

<p>By <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, he had relocated to Albany and was living in a modest home on <a href="../../streets.html#pine">Pine</a> Street. In <a href="../../census1800.html#zs">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household included five children, two young adults, and two adults.  

<p>He was a member of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.  In 1800 and 1801, he purchased a grocer's license from the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> government.

 <p>Later, he sometimes, he was referred to as "Doctor."

<p>In <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyononda/SYRACUSE/villagecity.html">1807</a>, he left Albany and is said to have relocated to what became Syracuse. 

<p>In 1821, he is said to have taken his extended family (wife, three sons, and one married daughter) to <a href="http://mmm.lib.msu.edu/search/record.cfm?i=GB01a036">settle</a> in Oakland County, Michigan in 1821. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwood_Cemetery_(Birmingham,_Michigan)">1821</a>, "Dr. Ziba Swan of Albany, New York" purchased land for a cemetery in Birmingham, Michigan from the Federal government.

<p>In 1830, his household was configured on the Michigan census.

<p>Dr. Ziba Swan <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yRgXAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA312&dq=ziba+swan&lr=">died</a> at the end of  February 1847 in his seventy-ninth year. His widow survived until 1853.

<p>This transplanted Yankee probably <a href="../../criteria.html">lived</a> in Albany for about ten years during the 1790s and early 1800s.</p>
