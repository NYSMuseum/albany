<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Alida Smith</strong></a> probably was born during the 1730s. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on her origins and background.

<p>By the early 1750s, she had become the wife of Albany native <a href="../vz/wmvzandt335.html">Willem Van Zandt</a>. Up to 1772, the marriage produced at least eight children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Otherwise, her name has not been found in the <a href="../../churches.html">ch</a>urch records so far encountered. 

<p>These Van Zandts raised their family in a shoemaker's <a href="../../census1756.html#197">home</a> in the first ward. 

<p>William Van Zandt was dead by late summer of 1785 when his heirs were referenced by the city council.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#als">1788</a>, "Widow Van Sant" and her adult son, Thomas, were listed on the first ward assessment roll.

<p>Alida Smith Van Zandt may have survived the passing of her husband to become a functional widow. At this point, her profile has <a href="../qqqq.html">too many unanswered questions</a> to continue.</p>
