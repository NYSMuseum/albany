<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Sickles</strong></a> was the wife of Albany area resident <a href="../vp/abvplanck1100.html">Abraham Isaac Verplanck</a>. She probably was born within a few years of 1660. Although we have yet to connect her to the Albany <a href="sickles.html">Sickles</a> family, she probably was the daughter of <a href="zasickles5648.html">Zacharias 
Sickles</a>. We seek defining information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In 1683, her name (Anna Sickels) appears on a list of members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and next to that of <a href="../vp/abvplanck1100.html">Abraham Isaacs</a>.  Although we have not yet uncovered a marriage record for the couple, five children were christened by them between 1688 and 1695. One son was named Zacharias (pointing to the family of a possible Albany father). 

<p>These Verplancks appeared to have raised their family under the <a href="../../census1697.html#135">family umbrella</a> while Abraham was menial placeholder in the city of Albany. After 1700, they no longer appeared on city rolls.

<p>Without information on the subsequent life and passing of Anna Sickles Verplanck, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now! </p>
