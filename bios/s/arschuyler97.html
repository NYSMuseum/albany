<P>According to <a href="schuyler.html#sources">family</a>-based resources, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Arent Schuyler</strong></a> was born in June 1662. He was the fourth son in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vs/mvslicht.html">Margarita Van Slichtenhorst</a> Schuyler. He was one of eight children named (age given as 22 years) in the <a href="../../wills/willphpischuyler.html">will</a> filed by his parents in 1683. His father died the next year while his mother lived until 1711. Later in <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nkHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA243&lpg=PA243&dq=%22arent+schuyler%22+albany&source=bl&ots=-jCOuZO3A5&sig=3tMHnCtinX22k20k0kNJh6ANrSY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEYQ6AEwB2oVChMIl7Pf_arqxwIViFo-Ch3aowH1#v=onepage&q=%22arent%20schuyler%22%20albany&f=false">1684</a>, his widowed mother deeded him a house and lot in the second ward.

<p>This Arent Schuyler married three times. In November 1684, he wed <a href="../t/janteller6613.html">Jannetje Teller</a> (daughter of <a href="../t/wmteller.html">Willlem Teller</a>) at the  Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1700, six children were christened in Albany and New York. First wife Jannetie died following the birth of their last child. In December 1702, he married Swantje Van Duyckhuysen of New Jersey. She died after bearing five children. In 1724, he was in his sixties when he wed Maria Walters (daughter of Manhattan <a href="http://www.frostandgilchrist.com/getperson.php?personID=I10669&tree=frostinaz01">magnate</a> Robert Walter and Catherine Leisler). Within the first two marriages, Arent appears to have fathered twelve children. 

<p>In March 1685, he filed a joint <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=N0TQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA598&lpg=PA598&dq=wife+janneke+teller+schuyler&source=bl&ots=9P9RFTiEXz&sig=G3fvSHLHjvW9KquUPwko3rOl-nU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBmoVChMIq4b-793qxwIVSDc-Ch13Dwjz#v=onepage&q=wife%20janneke%20teller%20schuyler&f=false">will</a> with his then new wife, Jannetie Teller. It stated that children were expected and mentioned real and personal property. The survivor would become executor which Arent did upon the will's probate in 1689.
		
<p>At that time, he was known in Albany as an <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian Trader</a> and engaged in regular business with the new municipal government. Not all of the interactions were pleasant as in January 1687, he was <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Annals-of-Albany-Volume-2/974477/112">cited and fined</A> as a result of his behavior toward the firemasters that past  December.   In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#2">1689</a>, he was listed among the householders living in the second ward in Albany.

<p>In March <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1AxfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=arent+schuyler+casper+teller&source=bl&ots=sWDphYEiIc&sig=MKe1Oa-u9E6q-JVrjGcXym7L8hk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBmoVChMIgtKKn_TsxwIVCTo-Ch0ybQRi#v=onepage&q=arent%20schuyler%20casper%20teller&f=false">1690</a>, he was one of nine men led by his cousin <a href="abschuyler921.html">Abraham Schuyler</a> who were to serve at Crown Point and beyond. In December <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=arent+schuyler+casper+teller&source=bl&ots=Flp74SjdJh&sig=6Dz2MEB2kAYGmLOltmnUh8bt02c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwjRkIvV9uzHAhXBOz4KHdlUBfM#v=onepage&q=arent%20schuyler%20casper%20teller&f=false">1692</a>, he was paid from the provincial treasury for <a href="http://www.british-history.ac.uk/cal-state-papers/colonial/america-west-indies/vol13/pp743-753">bringing</a> "Shawanee Indians" from Philadelphia [to New York].   Perhaps as a militia <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=qpssAAAAYAAJ&pg=PT17&lpg=PT17&dq=arent+schuyler+canada&source=bl&ots=VJCgAWSTl2&sig=NbGAfFVzhxl4QfSZHDqeK0DCoNA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CE4Q6AEwCGoVChMImO73ue7sxwIVSl4eCh3Gswdx#v=onepage&q=arent&f=false">officer</a>, he is <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DC0WAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA187&lpg=PA187&dq=%22aaron+schuyler%22+new+york&source=bl&ots=_vZ3n89XCH&sig=k-XW3z2GrfgK_pJQSVx0WEkvUzc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CD0Q6AEwB2oVChMI2qzC4MjuxwIViHA-Ch1AbALz#v=onepage&q=%22arent%20schuyler%22&f=false">said</a> to have participated in military actions against the French in Canada during the 1690s. A decade later, he was <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/Colonial-New-York-Philip-Schuyler-and-His-Family-Volume-2-3/866961/202">serving</a> as an emissary in New Jersey. 

<p><a href="#port"><img src="../../images/jpg/arschuyler.jpg" align=right width=175 height=235 border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 alt="Arent Schuyler"></a> By 1695 (perhaps earlier), he had moved his growing family to Manhattan in hope of reversing what family-based resources have described as his sagging fortunes due to his wartime absences. Identified as a merchant, "Aaron Schuyler" was made a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA58&dq=aaron+schuyler+merchant&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMI2o3S9cXuxwIVSzY-Ch3idwrz#v=onepage&q=aaron%20schuyler%20merchant&f=false">freeman</a> of New York City in October 1695. He prospered in business which enabled him to obtain land in New Jersey.

 <p>About 1707, he was <a href="../../wills/willmgtvslicht.html">named</a> 
        by his widowed mother to share equally in his parents' estate. 
      <p>Following the death of his first wife, he remarried and <a href="http://www.jerseyhistory.org/findingaid.php?aid=0651">moved</a> 
        to Pompton Plains, New Jersey. He maintained his house on Broadway in 
        New York. In 1710, he acquired a large farm at New Barbados Neck, New 
        Jersey. His family prospered when they started to mine the copper deposits on their Jersey property. 
      <p>Arent Schuyler died at home in New Barbados in November 1730. The father 
        of eleven and the patriarch of the New Jersey branch of the <a href="schuyler.html">Schuyler</a> 
        family, he had lived almost sixty-eight years.</p>
