          <P>Scottish-ancestry <A href="#biography"><B>Robert Sanders</B></A> 
            was born in July 1705. He was the eldest son of Albany merchant <a href="bsanders1368.html">Barent 
            Sanders</a> and his wife <a href="../w/mawendell3044.html">Maria 
            Wendell</a> Sanders.</P>

          <P>Robert followed his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. During 
            the <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> of 1713-44, he ranged into the 
            Indian country and to New France where he furthered family business 
            connections. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/rosandersbw.jpg" align=right width=150 vspace=4 hspace=4 border=1 alt="young Robert Sanders"></a> 
            By 1740, the trader had become a businessman. He settled in Albany 
            where he married <a href="../l/malansing3502.html">Maria Lansing</a> 
            - the twenty-three-year-old daughter of an Albany merchant. At age 
            thirty five, he was more than a decade older than most <a href="../../marriages.html">Albany 
            grooms</a>. The marriage was short-lived and ended when Maria died 
            in 1743 following the birth of her first child.</p>

          <p>Robert Sanders remarried in 1747. His second wife was <a href="elschuyler1274.html">Elizabeth 
            Schuyler</a> - a twenty-two-year-old daughter of Albany's foremost 
            <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneer</a> family. Beginning a family at age forty-one, 
            his eight children were baptized between 1747 and 1761 in the Albany 
            <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parent were members 
            and pewholders.</P>

          <p><a href="../../wills/willbsanders1368.html">Heir</a> to an extensive estate, 
            Sanders was emerging as an important Albany merchant, <a href="#canada">Canada 
            trader</a>, and landholder. His career benefitted from the business 
            and patronage of regional magnate <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
            Johnson</a>. At the same time, he cemented community ties by serving 
            as constable and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the 
            second ward.</p>

          <p>But his marriage to the daughter of the temporarily leaderless Schuyler family 
            set the stage for advancement to the highest ranks in Albany circles. 
            In 1748, he was recognized by the governor with an appointment as 
            recorder or deputy mayor. In 1749, he was named judge of the county 
            court of common pleas. And in 1750, Robert Sanders was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
            of Albany. His administration hosted the <a href="../../albanycongress.html">Albany 
            Congress</a> and witnessed the outbreak of the last of the <a href="../../7yw.html">French 
            and Indian Wars</a>. Later in 1754, he was replaced by Albany mainstay 
            <a href="../h/hanshansen4954.html">Hans Hansen</a>.</p>

          <p>Now in his mid-fifties, Sanders fell back on his business and management 
            of the lands <a href="../../wills/willbsanders1368.html">inherited</a> from 
            his late father. His wife died in 1763 - leaving him to raise their 
            young family. At home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>, 
            Robert Sanders made his <a href="../../wills/willrosanders1443.html">will</a> 
            on May 17, 1765. It provided the five living children with extensive 
            real and personal property. Although claiming he was "in good health" 
            just two weeks earlier, he died later that month and was <a href="#cemetery">buried</a> 
            in the church cemetery.</p>

          <p>Without surviving sons, the Albany end of Sanders business interests fell to 
            son-in-law, <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a>. The 
            career of Robert Sanders marked a high point for the <a href="sanders.html">family</a> in early Albany history.</p>
