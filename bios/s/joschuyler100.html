          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Johannes Schuyler</B></A> was born in Albany 
            in 1668, youngest of the six sons of <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip 
            Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vs/mvslicht.html">Margarita Van Slichtenhorst</a> 
            Schuyler.</p>

          <p>Johannes grew up in the new <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">family 
            home</a> on State Street and on the farm at <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">the 
            Flats</a>. Although Philip Pieterse died when the boy was just fifteen, 
            his <A href="#portrait"><IMG 
      align=right alt="Johannes Schuyler" border=1 width=200 hspace=4 src="../../images/jpg/joschuyler100.jpg" vspace=4></A> 
            father was able to establish three of his sons in advantageous business 
            situations beyond Albany. Eldest son <a href="pischuyler61.html">Pieter 
            Schuyler</a> succeeded in his father's Albany-based enterprises. Young 
            Johannes was able to follow in the Albany setting as well. Few <a href="../../nnd.html">New 
            Netherland families</a> were able to place their children so well.</P>

<p>Residing with his widowed mother, Johannes Schuyler grew into adulthood. An accomplished <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> who often went into the Indian country, he  learned business and the responsibilities of landholding. Beginning in 1690, held <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> commissions - where as <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">Captain</a> and Colonel he served Albany interests long and well.</p>

          <p>In April 1695, he married the widow <a href="elsstaats99.html">Elsie 
            Staats Wendell</a> - already the mother of eleven children. Marriage 
            to the daughter and widow of two of early Albany's foremost families 
            was not surprising. However, Johannes was twenty-seven and his bride a decade older. In addition, Elsie was expecting and would give birth to the first of their four children just eight months later. This union of an older women to a much younger man is <a href="../../marriages.html">without parallel</a> in early Albany history.</p>

<P>Johannes moved into his wife's home on State Street and was elected to the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a> in 1695. He would hold the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> aldermanic seat for much of the next two decades. His trading experience made him one of the more active members of the <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>. As late as 1737, he was sent into the Onondaga country on a diplomatic mission.</P>

<p>In 1703, this <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city father</a> was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of Albany. Re-appointed three more times, he served until 1706.  In 1710, he was elected to represent Albany County in the provincial Assembly - where served until 1713. During this time, he retained his seat on the common council.</p>

<p>Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">rolls</a> for the early 1700s show Johannes Schuyler to be one of the <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html">wealthiest</a> Albany traders. He was a supporter and deacon of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> and the <a href="#godfather">godfather</a> of many Albany children. Like many Albany leaders, he was able to acquire extensive frontier acreage and  administered his mother's lands as well. During the three decades of <a href="../../peace.html">peace</a> and development (1713-44), he was able to establish mills on some of those properties and engage tenants to begin to tap farm and forest potentials.<p>

<p>Having outlived all of his siblings, by the 1730s this onetime youngest son became patriarch of the Schuyler family - watching as children, Wendell stepchildren, and grandchildren succeeded to places of prominence and leadership in Albany and beyond. His wife died in 1737. He made his <a href="../../wills/willjoschuyler100.html">will</a> in 1742. City father, military leader, Indian diplomat and frontier developer, Johannes Schuyler's long career spanned Albany's transition from <a href="../../art/art-ote.html">outpost to entrepot</a>. He died in February 1747 - a year shy of his eightieth birthday.</p>

          <p><a name=portrait></a>This <b>portrait</b> of Johannes Schuyler has 
            been <a href="../../images/jpg/jandeschuyler.jpg">sewn together</a> 
            with a portrait of his wife. It has been widely reproduced and is 
            in the collection of the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/">New-York 
            Historical Society</a> This unusual double painting was painted prior 
            to Elsie’s death in 1737. Both portraits probably were done by Scottish-born 
            artist John Watson. In 1741, the double portrait was noted in Johannes 
            Schuyler's will.</p>
