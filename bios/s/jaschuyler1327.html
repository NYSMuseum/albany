<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacobus Schuyler</b></a> was born in March 1707. He was the son of <a href="abschuyler921.html">Abraham</a> and <a href="../t/getbroeck46.html">Geertruy Ten Broeck</a> Schuyler. His father was a prominent Albany businessman. However, Abraham Schuyler neglected to name the two-year-old in the <a href="../../wills/willabschuyler921.html">will</a> he filed in 1709.</p>


<p>Jacobus married Albany native <a href="gestaats4585.html">Geertruy Staats</a> in November 1735. By 1752, their eight children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>These Schuylers lived in Albany's north end. Perhaps they resided with his widowed mother! In 1737, Jacob was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1327">1742</a>, his name appeared on an Albany freeholder's list. Except for witnessing a will in 1753, subsequent references to him are rare in the community-based record.</P> 

<p>Jacobus Schuyler died in the Spring of 1760 and was buried on May 5 from the Albany Dutch church.</p>
