<P>The <a href="#sources"> <strong>Stafford</strong></a> family came to Albany following the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. The Staffords were New Englanders initially from Plymouth, Rhode Island, and then Cheshire, Massachusetts. They were the children of <a href="../../res/sp.html">Joab</a> <a href="jobstafford.html">Stafford</a> and his wife, <a href="suspencer.html">Susanna Spencer</a> Stafford. Albany businessman <a href="thspen.html">Thomas Spencer</a> was her nephew. 

<p>Two of their younger sons, <a href="jostaff7239.html">John</a> and <a href="spstaff.html">Spencer Stafford</a>, became Albany residents and prominent <a href="../../yankinv.html">Yankee</a> businessmen in the decades following the war. Spencer Stafford, in particular, was able to enhance his status through his marriage in 1790  to a daughter of the <a href="../h/hallenbeck.html">Hallenbeck</a> family - owners of a large section of the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">south side</a> of the city.

<p>In 1813, the <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius Street</a> residences and business of John and Spencer Stafford were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22stafford2&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22stafford&f=false">listed</a> in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a>.

<p>In little more than a generation, the Staffords were an embodiment of how New Englanders changed and carried Albany into the nineteenth century. Their path forward was aided by fortunate <a href="../../newcomers.html">marriages </a> with daughters of more mainline Albany families.</p>

The principal family-based resource was presented by Joel Munsell in volume 3 of his <a href="../../sources.html#mc"><i>Collections</i></a> series (pp.440-58). It includes a comprehensive genealogy of the family in America. At this point, it appears most accessible online following <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N4QAlJRljdEC">this link</a>.  Most of our presentation on the <a href="../../na/na.html">NA</a> aspects of this family's history is taken from that <a href="../../res/ts.html">traditional source</a>.  As with many New England families, that history is well documented on the <a href="http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy&hl=en&source=hp&q=%22stafford%20family%22%20albany&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&oq=%22stafford+family%22+albany+history&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&fp=739cf39a78c48e1&biw=1404&bih=605&pf=p&pdl=300">Internet</a>.
