<strong>Jochim Staats</strong></a> was born in April 1729. He was the eldest son in the family of <a href="isstaats4592.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdu5554.html">Maria Van Deusen</a> Staats. He grew up with several brothers in a comfortable house in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 


<p>In March 1761, he was almost thirty-two when he married <a href="../v/gsvedder6765.html">Geesie Vedder</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their daughter was christened in the Albany church in 1767 where he was a pewholder, baptism sponsor, and later a church officer. Perhaps, she was their only child.

<p>In 1753, he was appointed constable for the first ward. Three years later, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. He also served in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>In 1764, his name was included on a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4599">petition</a> submitted by Albany merchants. From that time on, he was found among Albany's mainstays. Over the next three decades, his first ward property was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4599">1788</a>, his property was situated in the midst of Albany's <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4599">1790</a>, this household included his wife and two other females.

<p>At the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, Jochim Staats was forty-six-years-old. He subscribed for the relief of Ticonderoga but appears to have done no more than to be <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#4599">exempted</a> from service by virtue of his age just a few years later. 

<p>Jochim I. Staats may still have been living in 1808. </p>
