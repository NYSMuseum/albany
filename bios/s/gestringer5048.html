<strong>Gertrude Stringer</strong></a> was born  in July 1772. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="sastringer5046.html">Samuel</a> and <a href="../vd/ravdh5712.html">Rachel Vanderheyden</a> Stringer. She grew up a daughter in a small family in the <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html#2">Market Street</a> home of Albany's premier physician. 

<p>In 1794, she married New York native <a href="../t/ritreat.html">Richard S. Treat</a>. By 1802, the marriage had produced five children.

<p>Gertrude seems to have raised her family in the smaller house adjoining the grand ediface erected by her father at what became 309 North Market Street from where Treat practiced law. Perhaps, they were closely connected with the family of her older <a href="lystringer5049.html">sister</a> - whose well-connected <a href="../l/stlush416.html">husband</a> pursued a number of legal and business initiatives from the office he shared with Treat. They probably lived either above or in the rear of the two-story, frame building that adjoined on the south the Lush-Stringer mansion.

<p>In 1848, a New York State Supreme Court <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-wMEAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA409&lpg=PA409&dq=%22gertrude+treat%22+albany&source=bl&ots=rOeItmpTDt&sig=nIWgYlCEbPYlDnyCzIKPbTx4FzY&hl=en&ei=S0kmSuCaHp2ltgfYkLjjBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4">referenced</a> an action by Gerturde Treat (named as the principal) in 1832 to fund the erection of eight brick buildings on Market Street with funds from the estate of her late father.

<p>After a marriage of more than forty years, Richard Treat died in 1837. In February 1839, the Albany newspaper <a href="../../guide/histres.html#nn">noted</a> the passing of Gertrude Stringer Treat, the widow of Richard S. Treat.  She had lived for more than sixty-seven years. 

<p>Many years following her death, another case before the New York State Supreme Court <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Row7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA392&lpg=PA392&dq=%22gertrude+treat%22&source=bl&ots=BL1Zepq4oR&sig=uscjLTdlAre1SVLYtULvf-AyCqo&hl=en&ei=40YmSsniMaXhtgfUi9HkBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2">further described</a> her additional holdings on "Broadway" and the disposition of her family.
