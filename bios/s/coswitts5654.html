<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelis Switts</b></a> was born in Schenectady in January 1680. He was the first son of community pioneers Isaac and Susanna Groot Switts.</p>

<p>In February 1690, he was captured during the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady Massacre</a> along with his father and taken to Canada. Returning a year later, Cornelis eventually <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/resources/patent/swits_c.html">purchased</a> a lot in the village of Schenectady.</p>

<p>In November 1702, he married Albany native <a href="../v/hevisscher4076.html">Hester Visscher</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, he relocated to Albany. By 1719, nine children were baptized in the Albany church where he was a prominent member.</p>

<p>Cornelis Switts became a <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5654">mainline</a> Albany resident. He served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the third ward in 1712, belonged to a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company, paid taxes, and qualified to <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#5654">vote</a> in 1720.</p>

<p>In 1712, he was <a href="../../wills/willdivisscher4067.html">indebted</a> to his father-in-law for half the cost of a sloop. Cornelis Switts probabaly died during the 1730s or 40s. His widow lived on until 1757.</p>
