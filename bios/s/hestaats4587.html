<P><a href="#sources"><b>Henry Staats</b></a> was born in 1741. He was the son of Albany cooper <a href="isstaats4592.html">Isaac Staats</a> and his wife, <a href="../vd/mavdu5554.html">Maria Van Deusen</a> Staats. He grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> and also at the family country seats located across the Hudson.</p>


<p>With his older brother <a href="wmstaats4561.html">William</a>, Henry Staats engaged in business and <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">shipping</a>. By the late 1760s, the Staats brothers were still living in their father's home but already had emerged as shippers of some note. Among their clients was Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>. By the 1770s, they had taken control of the old <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler house</a>. Over the next three decades, they added to those holdings as their multi-use business/residence eventually spread across almost an entire block.</p>

<p>In 1770, Henry married Mary Dumond. That marriage produced four children before her death during the late 1770s. In 1782, he remarried. His second wife was thirty-five-year-old <a href="../l/anlott.html">Anna Lott</a> of Long Island. That marriage produced four children as well. He was a member and officer of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>In May 1775, he was appointed lieutenant of the first ward watch by the Albany 
        <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a>. He also contributed 
        to the committee's relief efforts. However, by the end of the summer, 
        he was in trouble with the committee for possessing imported tea and for 
        seeking to sell it. In December, he was removed from his position in the 
        Watch company. Perhaps shielded by <a href="phschuyler1750.html">General 
        Schuyler</a>, this conservative merchant managed to avoid reproach until 
        <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting01paltrich#page/170/mode/2up">July 
        1778</a> when he was among those who refused to take a loyalty oath. Branded 
        a "loyalist," he was ordered to prepare for banishment or removal to the enemy lines. 
        However, he was able to <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/detectingdefecting01paltrich#page/203/mode/2up">defend himself</a> and apparently was able to avoid deportation.<a href="../../inprog.html">!</a></p>


<p>The war ended leaving the Staats brothers secure in their <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2">holdings</a> on Albany's main street. After the war, he continued to add to his Albany property that included the <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">landmark</a> building that featured a popular tavern on the southeastern corner. These extensive holdings were shared with his <a href="wmstaats4561.html">brother's family</a> and were attended by a number of servants. As late as <a href="../../census1800.html#4587">1800</a>, the larger household included seven slaves. Henry's <a href="../../census1790.html#4587">home</a> was located on the south side of the main building!</p>
 
<p>Known as "Captain" in reference to his past sailing days, Henry Staats died at age seventy-three. His will passed probate in April 1814.</p>
