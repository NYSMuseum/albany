<strong>Barrentje Spoor</strong></a> was born about 1690. She <a href="../../res/ts.html">pr</a>obably was the daughter of Jan and Anna Marie Hanse Spoor of <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a>.


<p>In December 1713, she married Albany native <a href="../b/thbarret7220.html">Thomas Barret</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1719, three children had been christened in Albany. 

<p>In 1718, her husband was making arrangements to purchase a lot in Albany. He was dead by March 1719 when Barentje was called a widow and was granted the lot against <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a> at what became the western corner of South Pearl <a href="../../im/imspearldiag.html">and</a> Hudson Streets. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#182">1756</a>, the house of "Mrs. Barret" was configured on a census of Albany householders. Her occupation was given as <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> and her house was described as small but roomy enough for up to eight soldiers "in a pinch."
 
<p>Barrentje Spoor Barret lived until 1760 and was buried from her church in September. In 1767, four lots behind her house and lots were going to be sold. Her grandson, cooper <a href="../b/thbarret7235.html">Thomas Barret</a>, was a long time Albany resident.</p>
