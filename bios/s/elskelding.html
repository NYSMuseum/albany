<strong>Elizabeth Skelding</strong></a>  <a href="../../res/sp.html">(S</a>kelking) was <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=johnldevinney&id=I0747">born</a> in October 1764. She was the first daughter born to James and Mary Hoyt Skelding of Stamford, Connecticut. 

<p>Betsey appears to have been just sixteen when she married <a href="../l/jalockwood.html">Jared Lockwood</a> in Stamford in December 1780. The marriage produced at least three children who were christened in Connecticut in the years that followed.

<p>We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> information on the first two decades of their marriage.

<p>By <a href="../../census1800.html#jl">1800</a>, they were living in Albany in a modest house in the first ward. Her husband was a merchant and ran a boardinghouse. Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA76&lpg=PA76&dq=%22lockwood+jared&source=bl&ots=2hLxOZXx9A&sig=1u1u_V4JYutjq_trCGqkeuehJ04&hl=en&ei=JzFfSpOOH46itgfMkZzgAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4">1813</a>, city directories listed their home and business addresses at various riverside locations.
 
<p>Jared Lockwood died in 1823 at the age of 64. Following her husband's death, she may have moved in with one of her sons or with other family members who were Albany residents. Betsey was living in Albany in December 1836 from where she filed an <a href="../l/jalockwood.html#ar"">affidavit</a> in support of her pension application.

<p>Eliabeth Skelding Lockwood <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=nc0pAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA364&lpg=PA364&dq=%22jared+lockwood%22&source=bl&ots=krwfhJ2KvU&sig=MgimaAsawRI8viuuvn98qAQJp_Q&hl=en&ei=cJpgSomjLImvlAfz64jeCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10">died</a> in Stamford, Connecticut in June 1849. The widow of Jared Lockwood had lived for eighty-five years. She was <a href="http://www.ctgenweb.org/county/cofairfield/pages/cemetery/cm_stmfrd/stjohn-standrew.htm">buried</a> with other members of the Skelding family.<p>
