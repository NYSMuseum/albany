<strong>Maria Spoor</strong></a> was born about 1755. She most likely was a daughter of one of several Spoor families having children in <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> at that time.

<p>In February 1776, she married Albany native <a href="../b/sabromley5963.html">Samuel Bromley</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. As no children were christened at the Dutch church or shown on subsequent census documents, it appears that the marriage was childless. In 1788, she was identified as a member and communicant at the First <a href="../../lutheran.html">Luthern church</a>.

<p>These Bromleys set up their home along what became upper <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a> at the intersection of Dove Street. That location was on the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">Schenectady road</a> several blocks above the settled city. There, Samuel Bromley operated an inn.


<p>Maria Spoor Bromley was accounted for on the Albany census in 1820 but was dead by July 1826 when her seventy-three-year-old husband re-married.</p>
