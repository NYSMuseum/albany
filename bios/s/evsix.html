<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources">
<strong>Evert Sixberry</strong></a> was born about 1715. He may have been the son of Nicholas and Maria or of "Manassah" <a href="../../res/sp.html">S</a>ixberry. We do know that this individual lived in Albany during the middle decades of the eighteenth century.

<p>By 1738, he had married Elsie Egmont. By 1762, nine children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and one at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a>. His first son was named "Nicholas."

<p>In 1739, he petitioned for and purchased a small piece of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">land</a> from the city government. In August 1741, he purchased more Albany land.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#evs">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders living in the first ward. In 1743 and '47, he was engaged and paid for building and supplying the blockhouse.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1767</a>, the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> house and property of "Mtsr. Sixbury" received a moderately substantial assessment. At the same time, Evert Sixberry was assessed for land in the West Manor of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.
 
<p>Evert Sixberry may have died in New Scotland in 1774.</p>
