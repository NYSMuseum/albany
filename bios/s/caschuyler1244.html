          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Catharina Schuyler</B></A> was born in Albany 
            in March 1704. She was the last child born to <a href="elsstaats99.html">Elsie 
            Staats Schuyler</a> and her husband, Albany businessman <a href="joschuyler100.html">Johannes 
            Schuyler</a>.</P>

          <P>As the daughter of Albany's most prominent family, Catharina grew up in a <a href="#bustling">bustling 
            home</a> on Albany's main street and passed summers with her even 
            larger extended family on the Schuyler farm at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flats</a>. 
            As the girl became a woman, she was introduced to many of the most 
            eligible young men in the region.</P>

          <p>In December 1726, she married <a href="../c/cocuyler388.html">Cornelis Cuyler</a>, 
            son of a <a href="../../newcomers.html">recently</a> established Albany trading family, at the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany 
            Dutch church</a>. By 1747, the union had produced eleven children 
            who were baptized in the Dutch church where both parents were prominent 
            members.</p>

<p>These Cuylers first lived near the river. But by the 1730s, they had built a <a href="#home">new home</a> on the hill above Pearl Street in the <a href="../../wards.html">second ward</a>. Cornelis Cuyler became an Albany leader and was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html#cocu">mayor</a> of the city in 1742. Catharina added to their fortune with bequests from her <a href="../../wills/willjoschuyler100.html">father</a> and other family members.</p>

          <p>By February 1758, fifty-three-year-old Catharina was seriously ill - suffering 
            from pleurisy and "pain in the side." She died on February 21 and 
            was buried from the Dutch church. Her son, <a href="../c/abccuyler359.html">Abraham 
            C. Cuyler</a>, became mayor of Albany in 1770.</p>
