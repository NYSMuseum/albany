<P><a href="#sources"><b>Geertruy Staats</b></a> was born in March 1711. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="bastaats136.html">Barent</a> and <a href="../vd/covdb5749.html">Neeltie Vandenbergh</a> Staats.</p>

<p>In November 1735, she married <a href="../s/jaschuyler1327.html">Jacobus Schuyler</a> - further cementing the bond between those two families. By 1752, most of their eight children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p> 

<p>These Schuylers lived in Albany's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> - perhaps with Jacob's widowed mother.</p>

<p>Geertruy lost her husband in 1760. After that, her family may have resided with her son or in the Pearl Street <a href="../../census1790.html#201">household</a> of her married <a href="elstaats4566.html">sister</a>.</p>

<p>Beginning in 1799, her name appears on the city's <a href="../../poor.html">poor rolls</a>. She was identified as a resident of the third ward and was allowed 15 pounds a year. She also received <a href="#aid">aid</a> in a variety of forms from the Dutch church.</p>

<p>In 1802, she would have been ninety-one-years-old!</p>
