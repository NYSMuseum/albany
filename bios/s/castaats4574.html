<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Staats</b></a> was born during the late 1670s. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jastaats4595.html">Jacob</a> and Ryckie Staats. Her father was a prominent surgeon who <a href="../r/irlydius4613.html">re-married</a> in 1711 following the death of his first wife. Catharina followed her family into the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> - which she joined herself in 1696. </p>


<p>In December 1699, she married Albany trader <a href="../vs/govs3956.html">Gosen S. Van Schaick</a>. By 1719, their nine children had been christened in Albany.</p>

<p>These Van Schaicks set up their home near the river and the Dutch church. However, the marriage ended with the untimely death of Gosen in 1725 at the age of thirty-eight. Catharina buried him in the churchyard cemetery. She would live another three decades as his widow.</p>

<p>In 1734, she was left two parcels of pasture land near the old fort in the <a href="../../wills/willjastaats.html">will</a> of her father. Perhaps she resided with her son, <a href="../vs/sgvschaick.html">Sybrant</a>, who would be appointed mayor of Albany in 1756. 

<p>Catharina Staats Van Schaick filed a will in November 1756. It passed probate in July 1761.</p>
