<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac Switts</b></a> was born in September 1706. He was the son of Albany newcomers <a href="coswitts5654.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../v/hevisscher4076.html">Hester Visscher</a> Switts. These <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> expatriots set up their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Among other things, his father ran a sloop - an enterprise that eventually was passed on to Isaac.</p>

<p>In February 1728, he married Schenectady resident <a href="../v/mavro1527.html">Maria Vrooman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1746, their six children were baptized at the Albany church where he was a member, pewholder, and occasional baptism sponsor. In 1768, he also joined <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church along with "his negro," Tom.</p>

<p>This Switts family lived in a "good house" in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> where Isaac was <a href="../../census1756.html#318">known</a> as a skipper. He also was a <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#5661">merchant</a>. In 1750, he was elected assistant <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> and was a contractor of the city government. Among his customers was Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> - who counted Capt. Switts among his regular informants and carriers. Although Switts owned additional acreage in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and on the <a href="../../loc/wout.html">outskirts</a> of the city, he was primarily a sloop captain whose career spanned several decades.</p>

<p>He was an officer in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. By the late 1760s, no doubt with Johnson's help, he had become lieutenant colonel of the Albany city regiment. Beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5661">1742</a>, His name was included on lists of Albany freeholders.</p> 

<p>Isaac Switts died in December 1787 and was buried from the Dutch church. He had lived more than eighty-one years! His will passed probate in September 1791.</p>
