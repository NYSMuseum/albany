<P>According to his <a href="#monument">tombstone</a>, the Albany resident we know as <a href="#sources"><B>Captain Samuel Schuyler</b></a> was born on October 20, 1781. The story of his formative years is unknown. But we may <a href="../../res/guess.html">expect</a> it is in some way related to that of early Albany's <a href="schuyler.html">foremost founding family</a>. By 1805, this Samuel Schuyler had married <a href="../qqqq.html#one">one</a> Mary Martin/Mortin - a mulatto woman, and their son Richard March Schuyler was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>. Over the next twenty years, ten more children would be born to those Albany parents.</P>

<p>By that time, Samuel Schuyler had begun to find work along the Albany waterfront. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, he was one of a number of <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro Albanian</a> men (described on the tax roll as "Blackman") whose personal property was assessed along <a href="../../streets.html#quay">Quay Street</a>. Within a few years, he was running his own boat. As time passed, he gained local repute as a towboat operator and was widely known as "Captain" Samuel Schuyler.</p>

<p><a href="#italics"><img src="../../images/jpg/sschuylerdir.jpg" width=250 height=100 border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Samuel Schuyler's address from the 1815 City Directory" align=left></a>In 
        <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22schuyler+samuel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22schutyler%20samuel%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> listed 
        "Skipper" Samuel Schuyler's home <a href="../../map/blackhouseholds1815.html">at</a> 
        204 South Pearl Street. In 1815, the directory listed his name and address 
        but for the first time, <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">italicized</a> 
        his name indicating that he was a "free person of color." By 1815, Schuyler's 
        holdings included several lots along South Pearl Street between Bassett 
        and Schuyler Streets. By that time, he also began to acquire additional 
        real estate in a budding <a href="../../pgms/css.html">Afro Albanian</a> 
        neighborhood in the city's <a href="#southend">South End</a>. As late 
        as <a href="#1822">1822</a>, his name still appeared in italics. Over the next twenty years, 
        his family holdings spread east including dozens of lots that would give 
        these Schuylers control of a two-block area that ran from South Pearl 
        Street toward the waterfront. </p>

      <p>By the 1830s, Captain Samuel Schuyler had been joined by his sons. By mid-decade, 
        <i>Samuel Schuyler & Company</i>, a flour and feed store located at Bassett 
        and Franklin Streets, was advertising in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city 
        directory</a>. His sons would build the <i>Schuyler Towboat Company</i> 
        into a successful Albany business. Making the transition from sail to 
        steam, the Schuylers also operated a coal yard on their South End property.</p>

<p><a name="ss"></a><a href="#monument"><img src="../../images/jpg/sschuylermonument.jpg" border=1 hspace=4  vspace=4 width=125 align=left></a> Captain Samuel Schuyler died in May 1842. His <a a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> provided that his widow Mary have use of the entire estate ("chiefly real estate in the city of Albany") during her lifetime and then the property would be shared equally by his five adult and three minor children.

<p>An impressive monument to him was erected (probably by his children) on one of the <a href="../../na/cssplot.html">most prominent vistas</a> overlooking the Hudson at <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>.</p>
          
<p>Patriarch of a prominent Afro-Albanian family, Captain Samuel Schuyler was perhaps Albany's first significant African-ancestry businessmen. We continue to seek closure on basic elements of his life. In the meantime, we welcome the opportunity to discuss this further in a <a href="../../pgms/css.html">public program</a> focused on his role in the formation and emergence of an Afro        Albanian middle class in early Albany.</p>

This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based  resources</a>. At this point, our thoughts regarding his precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> can only be speculative. Others have sought out answers to his past. The most informed source on Samuel Schuyler is  a thoughtful, thorough, and all over wonderful  two volume work we know as "<a href="../../sources.html#csg">Christoph's <i>Schuyler Genealogy</i></a>."  For information on this particular family, see volume II, part 2,  pp. 169-71. He is a prominent character in our <a href="../../art/art-jls.html">seminal article</a> on Afro Albanian community life published in 1996. A  more focused <a href="../../pub.html#css">essay</a> on him appeared in 2001. Because they all  appear to have been born after 1800, none of Samuel and Mary Schuyler's eleven documented children qualify for inclusion in the CAP <a href="../../criteria.html">study population</a>.

        Excerpt from the <b>1815</b> edition of the city directory showing Skipper 
        Samuel Schuyler's name in italics. The last line in the preface to that 
        volume states "Those persons whose names are in italics are <b>free people 
        of color</b>." (Emphasis supplied) 
        <p><a name=1822></a>The most recent city directory we have examined in detail is for the year <b>1822</b>. Not only was the name of skipper Samuel Schuyler at 203 S. Pearl Street italicized, but the next two entries on the directory page were for Thomas Schuyler on Lydius St. "cond." and Samuel Schuyler, a waiter at 67 N. Pearl. Both of those names were italicized as well. However, in 1827, the names of those Schuyler were not italicized.
 
<p><a name="monument"></a><a href="#ss"><img src="../../images/jpg/sschuylermonumentdet.jpg" alt="top of Schuyler monument" border=1 hspace=2  vspace=2 height=50 align=left></a>Steve and Staren Bielinski standing in front of the <b>Samuel Schuyler monument</b> at Albany Rural Cemetery in May 2000.

<p><a name="southend"></a>Initially, the <a href="../../loc/southend.html"><b>South End</b></a> was a term used to describe the so-called "pastures" sitting on the flood plain and located south of <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius Street</a>, east of <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl</a>, and bordered by the southern <a href="../../citylimits.html">boundary</a> of the city. That tract had been deeded from the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> to the city <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a> in 1815. Today, the term is much more encompassing - covering (at the least) both sides of South Pearl Street. We offer a <a href="../../pgms/css.html">public program</a> on Schuyler's role in the settlement of the initial South End!</p>
