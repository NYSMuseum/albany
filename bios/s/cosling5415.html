<P><a href="#sources"><b>Cornelis Slingerland</b></a> was born in June 1670. He was the youngest of three surviving sons of Albany residents <a href="tesling5439.html">Teunis Cornelise</a> and <a href="../b/enbradt4185.html">Engeltie Bradt</a> Slingerland. However, the boy was left to make his own way following the death of his father.

<p>He sought to pursue the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>. In 1687, Cornelis was identified in conjunction with other Albany traders. In <a href="../../census1697.html#158">1697</a>, his Albany household was configured on the census. Perhaps the woman noted was his mother. Shortly thereafter, he moved to <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and established more lasting roots.

<p>In May 1699, he married Eva Mebie at the Schenectady <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1720, the marriage had produced ten children. Most of them had been christened in Schenectady.

<p>Cornelis Slingerland was buried "in <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskatha</a>" in September 1753.
