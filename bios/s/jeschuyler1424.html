      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Jeremias Schuyler</b></a> was born in January 1698. 
        Named for his maternal grandfather, he was the son of Albany leader <a href="pischuyler61.html">Pieter 
        Schuyler</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vr/mavr5055.html">Maria 
        Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler. All five of those offspring lived to adulthood 
        and remained connected throughout their lives. <a ahref="../../res/sp.html">Jer</a>emias 
        also was the twin brother of <a href="pischuyler1736.html">Pieter Schuyler, 
        Jr.</a></p>
      <p>In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=pCQ2AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=%22jeremias+schuyler%22&source=bl&ots=I8UmLtDmCo&sig=vgrxOrueIzEGqiZ34Vsm_8iqnT4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiah4fdiqjYAhVGKiYKHVgyDdIQ6AEIQDAD#v=onepage&q=%22jeremias%20schuyler%22&f=false">1720</a>, 
        he was among those who received a provincial <a href="../../res/realestate.html">patent</a> 
        for land along the Paltz River in what then was Ulster County. 
      <p>During the <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Schuyler-215">early</a> 
        1720s, Jeremias married <a href="../b/susbayeux.html">Susanna Bayeux</a> 
        - the daughter of a prominent New York <a href="../huguenot.html">Huguenot</a> 
        family. Beginning in 1723, their five children were baptized in the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was an occasional baptism 
        sponsor.</p>
      <p>Jeremias set up his home in his father's old house on <a href="../../loc/court.html">Court 
        Street</a> near the Ruttenkill bridge. He was an Albany merchant and was 
        elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a> for the 
        first ward in 1725. 
      <p>He also owned a farm <a href="../../im/im1767.html">north of Albany</a> 
        and near those of his brothers <a href="pischuyler1736.html">Peter</a> 
        and <a href="phschuyler.html">Phillipus</a>. In June 1748, he was named 
        as a brother and heir in the <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler104.html">will</a> 
        filed by Phillipus Schuyler.</p>
      <p>Jeremias Schuyler lost his wife in 1747. He died in December 1753 and was buried in the family 
        plot at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flats</a>.</p>
