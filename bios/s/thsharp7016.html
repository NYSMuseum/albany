<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Thomas Sharp</strong></a> (sometimes <a href="../../res/sp.html">S</a>harpe) was born during the 1690s. Perhaps he was the son of a same-named individual who was a gunner at the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> in Albany in 1696.
<p>In November 1720, this Thomas married <a href="../d/madwarr7861.html">Maria De Warran</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1737, the marriage had produced at least six children. Some of them were christened at the Dutch church but he was a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. His wife died in November 1748 but he does not have appeared to have re-married. After his wife's passing, he lived with his daughters and remained <a href="../../coerec1771.html#7016">active</a> in St. Peter's affairs into the 1770s.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1719">1719</a>, he was appointed constable for the second ward. The next <a href="../../org/cc.html#1720">year</a>, he was named high constable. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1724">1724</a>, he served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1748">1748</a>, he was named constable but this time for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In 1741, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willmawinne3008.html">will</a> of a first ward neighbor. 

<p>In July 1754, he was called a "wig maker" in the <a href="../../wills/willluwyn6222.html">will</a> filed by a neighbor. In 1756, he was identified as a barber on a <a href="../../census1756.html#111">census</a> of householders taken by the British army. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#7016">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#7016">1763</a>, his name appeared on lists of Albany freeholders. During the 1760s, his Albany property was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">valued</a> moderately on city assessment rolls.


<p>Thomas Sharp filed a <a href="../../wills/willthsharp.html">will</a> in March 1771. It left his real estate, negroes, and other property to his three surviving daughters. He died in January 1773 and was buried from St. Peter's. The will passed probate in October.
