      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Scott</b></a> lived in Albany during the second 
        half of the eighteenth century. Provincial <a href="../../sources.html#clp">records</a> 
        later certified that John Scott served in the 60th Regiment of the British 
        army during the <a href="../../7yw.html">Seven Years War</a>. As a non-commissioned 
        officer, he was awarded land in Tryon County. Perhaps he was the same 
        individual who owned land on the south side of the Mohawk River in 1752. 
        In any event, we seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany.</p>
      <p>In 1761, Scott was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. In 1766, he was named <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
        for the first ward where owned a house and lot. In that year, he joined 
        with other Albany <a href="../../solconst.html#1800">Sons of Liberty</a> 
        in opposition to the Stamp Act. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#1800">private</a> 
        in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.</p>
      <p>In 1775, he was commissioned an Ensign in the first regiment of the Albany 
        County militia. He served in the Albany militia - ultimately becoming 
        Captain of the Albany regiment. After the war, his name headed the regiment's 
        land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">bounty list</a>.</p>
      <p>Apparently a bachelor, in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1800">1779</a> 
        Scott lived in a first ward home with the "Widow Halliday." Perhaps she 
        was his <a href="hiscott1170.html">sister</a>. The house probably had 
        a <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jss">shop</a> attached. Scott 
        also leased additional <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#jsl">lots</a> 
        from the Albany government. In <a href="../../census1790.html#1800">1790</a>, 
        his southside house was configured on the first Federal census.</p>
      <p>John Scott died in July 1797 and was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>.</p>

        <a name=sources></a><B>Sources:</B> The life of John Scott is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 1800. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> raises 
        many questions about his life and is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. Was he the same John Scott who received Letters of Administration
