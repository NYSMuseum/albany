<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Cortland Schuyler</strong></a> probably was born about 1767. He would have been the son of Albany native <a href="cortschuyler1260.html">Cortland Schuyler</a> and <a href="../g/bargray.html">Barbara Gray</a> Schuyler of Cork, Ireland. At that time, his father was a British army officer on duty in Ireland.

<p>Cortland Schuyler then brought his wife and young family to a <a href="../../im/im1767.html">farm</a> located <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">south</a> of the city of Albany. However, Cortland died in 1773 after falling from his horse. A few years later, widow Barbara returned to Europe with her children.

<p>In 1784, John Cortland Schuyler, the eldest son, <a href="../../fhg.html#csg">was sent</a> back to America to manage his mother's inherited properties and assets. Perhaps, he took up residence in what became <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>.

<p>In January 1790, he married <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NGYKAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=%22angelica+van+rensselaer%22+%22john+c.schuyler%22&source=bl&ots=hX7sovabyq&sig=rcpLY53iZ2dP2fN5BTGTT2h585c&hl=en&sa=X&ei=2x64UrjMGdbNsQS9nICQBg&ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22angelica%20van%20rensselaer%22%20%22john%20c.schuyler%22&f=false">young widow</a> Angelica <a href="../vr/vr.html">Van Rensselaer</a> at the Dutch church in Claverack. Their brief marriage <a href="#csg">appears</a> to have produced children.

<p>The name "John C. Schuyler" first appeared on a <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/columbia/genhistcolco/chapt12_1878_hist.htm">list</a> of attorneys practicing in Columbia County in 1790. However, at this point, we have not encountered additional references regarding this subject's occupation. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Perhaps</a> his public life was connected to the business of his new in-laws. In July 1793, his uncle, <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip Schuyler</a> <a href="#bond">ack</a>nowledged receipt of JCS's bond for more than 670 pounds. JCS's wife was the niece of Mrs. Schuyler.

<p>We seek qualitative information to help define the life of John C. Schuyler during the 1780s and 90s. He does not seem to be listed as a head of household on the First Census of <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> in New York State.</p>
 
<p>In December 1793, John C. Schuyler filed a <a href="../../wills/willjocschuyler.html">will</a>. Calling himself a resident of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">W</a>atervliet, he named his wife and mother as his primary beneficiaries. He died during the first half of 1794. Although the subject of subsequent <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rbL7xJhUIVoC&pg=PA41&lpg=PA41&dq=%22john+c.+schuyler%22+van+rensselaer&source=bl&ots=lbqiBCm4Fb&sig=SStxEHnkq-Hi47ArX3irD3FFZH8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=axe4UuaSD5DIsAS6w4LQCw&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22john%20c.%20schuyler%22%20van%20rensselaer&f=false">litigation</a>, the will passed probate in August 1797. His widow re-married in that year as well.
