<strong>Brandt Schuyler</strong></a> was born in December 1659. He was a son in the large family of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vs/mvslicht.html">Margarita Van Slichtenhorst</a> Schuyler. He grew up in the Albany area as a member of one of the colony's foremost families.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#140">1679</a>, this young Schuyler was identified as an Albany householder. 

<p>In July 1682, he married New Netherland native <a href="../vc/covcortlandt.html">Cornelia Van Cortlandt</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in New York City. By 1690, three children had been christened in New York where he was a church officer. This union helped cement the ties between two of seventeenth century New York's leading Dutch-ancestry families.

<p>Following his marriage, he moved to New York City. He entered business - perhaps in association with his upriver kin. He served as a <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> officer during the 1680s. His ascent was interrupted by the so-called <a href="../l/leisler.html">Leisler's Rebellion</a> during which he was arrested by Leisler.

<p>In 1694, he was appointed justice of the peace. In 1695, he was elected to the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a>. During the 1690s, he also served as alderman in New York.

<p>He filed a will in January 1700. Afflicted with smallpox, Brandt Schuyler died in New York in 1702.</p>
