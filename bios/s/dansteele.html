<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional and <A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/wv/snr/jcdurrie.html">online</a> resources, Albany resident  <strong><a href="#sources">Daniel Steele</a></strong> was born in March 1772. He was the son of Timothy and Sara Seymour Steele of Hartford, Connecticut. He was known as "the younger" to prevent confusion with an older <a href="dasteele1156.html">uncle</a> who had settled in Albany during the 1760s.

<p>We seek information on his formative years and <a href="../../res/origins.html">path</a> to Albany.

<p>This Daniel Steele was in Albany at least by the early 1790s when he was known as a <a href="../../trades/print.html">bookbinder</a> as he practiced his craft in the State Street printing office of his cousin's husband, <a href="../w/crwebster6841.html">Charles R. Webster</a>. He is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA233&lpg=PA233&dq=%22mr+daniel+steele%22+albany&source=bl&ots=2iJvHU_v2C&sig=xoSuRhMMtf93dHeZqlfukpFLhGc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=o_n5Tu72EYfi0QGs1KXAAg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22mr%20daniel%20steele%22%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have lost his stock in the <a href="../../fire.html">fire</a> that destroyed several blocks of the old Albany core in November 1793. 

<p>In April 1797, he married the younger Albany native <a href="../vb/elvbt5374.html">Elizabeth Van Benthuysen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1817, perhaps eleven children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. His mother was <a href="http://www.bettyfink.com/1stPrChCemQ-S.htm">buried</a> from the church in December 1808.


<p>This Daniel Steele was a <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> mainliner for the remainder of his life. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house on <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">Hudson Street</a> was valued modestly. In <a href="../../census1800.html#dast">1800</a>, his household consisting of two adults and five children first was configured on the Albany census in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. Three years later, a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">list</a> of Albany freeholders identified him as a bookbinder. In November that year, the newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=WqApAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA325&lpg=PA325&dq=%22daniel+steele%22+%22circulating+library%22&source=bl&ots=3ZwBeYWqzY&sig=n7k-aTshD48uTYzBAJAYYFeUpX0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=rzL7TsKfD8Ti0QGIsPjlCQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22daniel%20steele%22%20%22circulating%20library%22&f=false">noted</a> him opening "a circulating library, consisting of 400 volumes."  He was a member and trustee of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22steele+daniel%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22steele%20daniel%22&f=false">1813</a>, his house on <a href="../../streets.html#liberty">Liberty</a> Street and store on Court then South Market Streets were listed in the annual city directory. By 1813, he was identified as a "bookseller." With his kinsmen "Webster & Skinner" and alone, he was a notable publisher of sheet music and also of law books.


<p>His wife's brother, Obadiah Van Benthuysen (son of <a href="../vb/obvbt5357.html">Obadiah</a>), had been Steele's apprentice as early as <a href="http://dougsinclairsarchives.com/archhistory/staffordhouse/vanbenthuysen.htm">1801</a> and took over the business following Steele's death.
 
<p>Daniel Steele died in July 1828 and was buried in the Presbyterian cemetery plot. Letters of administration on his estate were granted two days later. This transplanted Yankee had lived for fifty-six years.</p>
