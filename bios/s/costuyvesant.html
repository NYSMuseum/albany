<strong>Cornelia Stuyvesant</strong></a> was born during the 1760s. She was the second daughter of New Yorkers Petrus and Margaret Livingston Stuyvesant. Her father was a property holder and noted philanthropist.

<p>In September 1785, she was still in her teens when she married twenty-year-old Albany native <a href="../t/ditbroeck37.html">Dirck Ten Broeck</a> at the New York City Dutch church. By 1798, the marriage had produced five children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, their family was inordinately large with at least seven more children born after 1798 and a number of others who were stillborn.

<p>These Ten Broecks made their <a href="../../census1790.html#37">home</a> on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> at Columbia. Dirck studied and practiced law, served several terms in the New York State Assembly, and was its speaker in 1798. As such, their landmark home was a center of capital city political activity.

<p>Dirck's subsequent legal career led him to spend considerable time in Manhattan. Financial difficulties caused him to liquidate much of his Albany estate.  

<p>Cornelia Stuyvesant Ten Broeck died in Trenton, New Jersey in 1825. Her husband lived until 1832.</p>
