          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Jacobus Davidse Schuyler</B></A> was born 
            in January 1675. He was the youngest son of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> 
            pioneers <a href="dapschuyler1262.html">Davidse Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vp/cavplanck.html">Catharina 
            Verplanck</a> Schuyler. He not yet fifteen and living in the family 
            home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> when his father was killed in the raid on <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> in 1690.</p> 

          <P>He joined the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in 1696 and was listed 
            next to his mother but living alone on the <a href="../../census1697.html#058">census 
            of 1697</a>. Perhaps he spent time in the Indian country like his 
            older <a href="abschuyler921.html">brothers</a>.</P>

<p>Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1697">1697</a>, he served the community as a constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> and as a firemaster and juror. In 1702, his third ward property was taxed at a rate comparable to a moderatly successful merchant.</p>
   
          <p>In 1700, Jacobus Schuyler had married Albany native <a href="../w/cawendell2767.html">Catharina 
            Wendell</a>. But she was dead within a year. In June 1704, he married 
            <a href="../w/suwendell2720.html">Susanna Wendell</a>. That marriage 
            produced but two children before his untimely death in March 1707 
            at age thirty-two!</p>
