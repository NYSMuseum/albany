<P>Based on subsequent records, Albany <a href="../../census1800.html#gisp">resident</a> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Giles Spencer</strong></a> appears to have been born prior to 1756. We <a href="#seek">seek</a> information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>His name has not been found among the householders listed on the census for New York State in 1790. Neither have we found information on his potential service during the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>.

<p>He was a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">wood</a> craftsman whose name first appeared on an Albany jury list in March <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>. At that time, he was identified as a "cabinetmaker." 


<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the city assessment roll valued his house and property in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> modestly. The census in <a href="../../census1800.html#gisp">1800</a> configured his household with an adult couple and two small children.

<p>In December 1800, his name appeared in the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">city records</a> on a list of <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemen</a>.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=%22spencer+giles%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22spencer%20giles%22&f=false"">1813</a>, city directories identified him as a "trunk and bandbox maker" at either 23 Green or 56 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>. He was one of a half dozen Spencers named in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a>. After 1827, Giles no longer appeared in the directories. 

<p>His wife, Hannah, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=%22giles+spencer%22&source=bl&ots=GuKbXs0GKG&sig=ehrCK6jKgOsDJYy0f0N8zMObmrk&hl=en&sa=X&ei=utaWT_LIJvTM6QGzpaiVDg&sqi=2&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22giles%20spencer%22%20&f=false">died</a> in July 1825. She had lived into her sixties. Giles Spencer passed on sometime after 1827. At this point, we have not encountered <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> information for him in the Albany-based record.</p>
