<strong>Isabella Seaton</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">often</a> Seton) was born after 1750. She probably was the daughter of Scottish emigres <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=e6tRAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA312&lpg=PA312&dq">Andrew</a> and Margaret <a href="../../res/sp.html">Seton</a> who settled on Long Island during the 1760s. These Setons were British sympathizers but raised a large family in a number of North American locations - finally moving south and settling in Florida where Isabella's father and mother died in 1794 and 1818 respectively.
 
<p>Isabella (or sometimes "Elizabeth") was the wife of Albany businessman <a href="../h/rhenry8427.html">Robert R. Henry</a>. Perhaps they <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yehmAAAAMAAJ&q=%22isabella+seton%22+henry&dq=%22isabella+seton%22+henry&lr=">married</a> in New York City in April 1794.  In 1799, their child was christened at the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church where he was a member and trustee (1807-15). <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=s5s-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA105&dq=%22isabella+seton%22#v=onepage&q=%22isabella%20seton%22&f=false">R</a>eportedly, they raised a large <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=e6tRAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA313&lpg=PA313&dq=%22isabella+seton%22+henry&source=bl&ots=FtAWgKfZpP&sig=c1WAVTamauttHxTMMyF3MU1jFcE&hl=en&ei=A8A3SrzgGZXcMK2Z6YoN&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3">family</a>. Henry's <a href="../h/jvhenry.html">brother</a> married Isabella's sister, Charlotte Seaton.

<p>In December 1799, Isabella and her husband <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.org/ny/saratoga/deeds/h/henry-phynn.txt">sold land</a> located in Stillwater (Saratoga County) to Phynn & Ellice - former Schenectady merchants. 

<p>For almost two decades, these Henrys were prominent North Market Street <a href="../../census1800.html#8427">residents</a> and Isabella's husband was an up-and-coming merchant and trader. 

<p>About 1815, Henry re-located his family to the American South and were living in Georgia in 1820. Robert R. Henry died in Savannah Georgia in 1851. We seek information on the later life and passing of Isabella Seaton Henry.</p>
