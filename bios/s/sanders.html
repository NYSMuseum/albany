<P><a href="#origin">Manhattan-born</a> silversmith <a href="rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a> settled in Albany about 1665. He was the founder a small but important family in early Albany and <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> history. 


<p>His only surviving son was <a href="bsanders1368.html">Barent Sanders</a>, a prominent Albany merchant of the early eighteenth century. Barent's two sons established the family in Albany and Schenectady. At the same time, Sanders daughters connected them to many  pominent Albany families through marriage.</p>

<p>Elder son <a href="rosanders1443.html">Robert Sanders</a> was appointed mayor of Albany in 1750. Without male heirs, the name passed from Albany rolls with his death in 1765. However, his daughter, <a href="desanders1415.html">Debora</a>, married her cousin Johannes Sanders - son of <a href="josanders.html">John Sanders</a> (an Albany native living in Schenectady) in 1777. </p>

</p>Their son, Barent Sanders, returned to Albany following his marriage to Catharina Bleecker in 1810!</p>
