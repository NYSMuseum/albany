      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Abraham Staats</b></a> was born about 1665. He was a 
        younger son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="abstaats.html">Abraham</a> 
        and <a href="../w/cawessels6863.html">Tryntie Wessels</a> Staats.</p>

<p>He married Albany native <a href="../w/elswendell2795.html">Elsje Wendell</a> in July 1696. Eleven months later, the first of their twelve children was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>The census of 1697 showed their new <a href="../../census1697.html#039">home</a> in Albany's first ward. He joined other Albany residents in signing a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#4551">loyalty oath</a> to the King of England in 1699. In 1700, his sloop was carrying cargoes on the Hudson for the provincial government. However, within a decade, he had <a href="#roll">sold most</a> of his Albany property and moved his family across the river to Staats lands near today's Stockport. He maintained a large farmstead and lived there for the remainder of his life. He acquired additional lands in that region.</p>

<p>Calling himself a resident of Claverack, Abraham Staats filed a will in 1731. It passed probate in January 1740!</p>
