 <P><A href="#biography"><B>Maria Sanders</B></A> was born in 1740. She was the daughter eldest daughter of Schenectady residents <a href="josanders.html">John</a> and <a href="../g/deglen.html">Debora Glen</a> Sanders. She grew up in a very large family of a Schenectady leader who owned property across the Mohawk and in Albany. </P>

          <P>At age nineteen, she married Albany merchant <a href="../b/jojabeekman3866.html">Johannes 
            Jas. Beekman</a> at the Schenectady Dutch church in 1759. Her first 
            child was baptized there in 1761. The other six were christened in 
            the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">church</a> between 1763 and 1781 
            where both parents were members.</P>

<p>These Beekmans made their home in Albany where Johannes was a prominent merchant and officeholder - his public career culminating in an appointment as <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> of the city in 1783. During that time, their <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home was an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#3866">landmark</a> that was served by four slaves in 1790.

<p>In 1779, she was named to inherit a share of substantial properties in the <a href="../../wills/willjosanders.html">will</a> of her father who died in 1782.

 

<p>Maria Sanders Beekman died at <a href="#bible">midnight</a> on November 2, 1794. She had lived but fifty-four years.</p>
