<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Schuyler</b></a> was born in April 1745. She was the daughter of Albany residents <a href="jaschuyler1327.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="gestaats4585.html">Geertruy Staats</a> Schuyler. Her father died when she was fifteen leaving Elizabeth to help her mother raise several small children.</p>


<p><a name=vdvrt>We believe that Anna was the wife of <a href="../g/jagourlay8213.html">James Gourlay</a>. Anna Schuyler had a son who grew up as "<a href="../g/jagourlay8214.html">James Gourlay</a>" but was was <a href="../../wills/willjagourlay.html">repudiated</a> by the elder Gourlay in 1772 as "none of my begetting." James Gourlay died later in 1772!</p>

<p>We believe that Anna married James Vandervoort of New Jersey about 1780. That union produced nine children - all but the first (1780) baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where Anna was a pewholder. A daughter, named Anna Gourlay, was baptized in Albany in 1798. One of the sponsors was James Gourlay.

<p>The assessment roll for<a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1084">1788</a> identified the "Widow Gourlay" as a boarder in a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> household.  

<p>Anna Schuyler Gourlay died in August 1798 at the age of fifty-four. James Gourlay buried "his mother" from the Albany Dutch church.</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Anna Schuyler Gourlay is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1084. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.
<br><dd>We recognize that this particular Schuyler-Gourlay association requires a leap of faith. But based on her age given at death and the baptism sponsorship and burial information, we <a href="#believe">believe</a> it to be correct!</p>
