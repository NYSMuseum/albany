<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Helena Schermerhorn</strong></a> was born with a few years of 1660. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New</a> Netherland pioneers <a href="jajscher5448.html">Jacob Janse</a> and <a href="../vv/javvoor7001.html">Jannetje Segers Van Voorhout</a> Schermerhorn. She grew up in a large family in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>/Albany, <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, and in other parts of her father's holdings in what would become <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> in 1683. 

<p>By the mid-1680s, she had married <a href="../vd/myhvdbogert6060.html">Myndert Harmense Vandenbogert</a>. Beginning in 1685, their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both partners were members and baptism sponsors.

<p>She was among the children noted as the wife of "Myndt. harmense" in the <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">will</a> filed by her father in May 1688.

<p>These Vandenbogerts were Albany <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#6060">mainstays</a> for a number of years. However, by the end of the century, Myndert Harmense probably had relocated to his recently acquired land in Dutchess County. Still in her thirties, Helena Schermerhorn Vandenbogert probably brought her family there as well. We seek defining information on her later life and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a>.</p>
