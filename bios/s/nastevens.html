<P>Also known as <a href="../../res/sp.html">St</a>ephens, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nathaniel Stevens</strong></a> was in Albany during the <a href="../../or/or-nw.html">War</a> for Independence. His not uncommon name dictates caution and leaves us with many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding his Albany life. 

<p>He probably was born in Canaan, Connecticut in May 1753. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=PjdVAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA56&lpg=PA56&dq=%22nathaniel+stevens%22+commissary&source=bl&ots=6X1JgAqnO6&sig=88jsaozQPFAeP6oQb6PXsWRSa5o&hl=en&ei=mAbDTKiuCcP98Aamib3uDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&sqi=2&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAw#">Thus</a>, he would have been a younger son in the very large family of Andrew and Esther Stevens. His father was a local official and French and Indian <a href="../../7yw.html">W</a>ar veteran who died in 1770.

<p>This individual was a farmer who <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the Revolutionary army. His name was <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_2d_reg.htm">included</a> among the enlisted men of the Second Regiment of the New York Line. <a href="http://www.stanklos.net/?act=para&pid=3737&psname=">Perhaps</a> he served as a sergeant in his older brother's company at Ticonderoga in 1775.

<p>He was connected to the Commissary Department and served in various <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BF83GXqGq4EC&pg=PA313&lpg=PA313&dq=%22nathaniel+stevens%22+commissary&source=bl&ots=OXykUh1C1Y&sig=VckJDbjkhd8sl50vTv2yUy7O0n0&hl=en&ei=mAbDTKiuCcP98Aamib3uDg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&sqi=2&ved=0CCcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22nathaniel%20stevens%22%20commissary&f=false">locations</a> in the Hudson Valley. Perhaps those <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc10431.htm">duties</a> brought him to Albany.

<p>Perhaps Nathaniel <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=delamontagne&id=I01426">married</a> "Pheobe Montnaye" who died about 1780. In 1782, he married Amy Whitney of Plainfield, Connecticut. Nine children resulted from the two marriages. However, his name does not appear in the records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> nor in the available records of the city's other <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">1781</a>, he was among the newcomers who purchased the Freedom of Albany. At that time, he was identified as a merchant.

<p>However, his name does not appear in the published <a href="../../guide/histres.html#arrec">records</a> of Albany's wartime committees and boards.

<p>But, perhaps he was one of a group of men and women New Englanders who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZeJpJoopshEC&pg=PA331&lpg=PA331&dq=%22nathaniel+stevens%22+albany&source=bl&ots=UnqP14FSKG&sig=5M8v_F7SGVkS9kDIIDohKb3n4VY&hl=en&ei=F2ziTMDALYLGlQeJ_7ytAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&sqi=2&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22nathaniel%20stevens%22%20albany&f=false">sailed</a> up the Hudson to visit Mother Ann Lee "at <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">A</a>lbany" in August 1784. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the household of a Nathaniel Stephens was configured on the census for York Town in Westchester County. However, at some time he returned to Connecticut where he lived for the remainder of his life.</p>
 
<p>Nathaniel Stevens died in Canaan in 1832. His widow received a pension for his wartime service - a portion of which brought him to Albany.</p>
