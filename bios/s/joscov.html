<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Scovill</strong></a> lived in Albany during the decades around <a href="../../census1800.html#josc">1800</a>. Subsequent information tells us that he was born between 1756 and 1777. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany, although he most likely came from <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA229&lpg=PA229&dq=john+scovill+aug+12,+1770&source=bl&ots=x6r45YBmTm&sig=Y4dZvf4XEmIbkG7PU9upGep7MXM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ydUSVbj9DoWnyASxmoC4BA&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=john%20scovill%20aug%2012%2C%201770&f=false">may have been born in 1770</a>.

<p>He first appeared on the community landscape in September 1798 when he was certified on a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">jury list</a> and identified as a "merchant/tailor." In 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and holdings in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> were valued on the city assessment roll.

<p>The census in <a href="../../census1800.html#josc">1800</a> counted a boy, a young man, a male and a female 26-45, and two "other" residents (probably meaning free people of color). A <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">decade later</a>, his household included a boy under 10, a girl 10-16, and a male and female each aged 26-45. In 1810, no one was listed under the category "all other free persons." Those households appear to been nuclear families but no evidence of a marriage or children has been uncovered.

<p>During the 1800s, his name was included on the membership roster of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In February 1802, "John Scovill of Albany" <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141&dq=%22john+scovill%22&source=bl&ots=x6r44RynTj&sig=3-n69HMInjFKPAMpbvfnAKuJnaw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YTIQVcjxNuSOsQSnloCgCw&ved=0CD0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=albany&f=false">purchased</a> "a rood of land, dwelling house and blacksmith shop in the southwest part of Watertown." In April 1808, John Scovill, still of Albany" sold the property to one David M. Bradley.
  
      <p>After 1810, the name of John Scovill has not been found on Albany rolls. Perhaps 
        he returned to Connecticut.<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA229&lpg=PA229&dq=john+scovill+aug+12,+1770&source=bl&ots=x6r45YBmTm&sig=Y4dZvf4XEmIbkG7PU9upGep7MXM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ydUSVbj9DoWnyASxmoC4BA&ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=john%20scovill%20aug%2012%2C%201770&f=false">Family-based 
        resources</a> tell us that he died on October 10, 1830 at an unspecified 
        place. </p>
