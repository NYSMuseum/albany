<P><a href="#sources"><b>Pieter Schuyler, Jr.</b></a> was born in January 1698. He was the son of Albany leader <a href="pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vr/mavr5055.html">Maria Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler. He was the twin brother of <a href="jeschuyler1424.html">Jeremiah Schuyler</a>.

<p>Pieter Schuyler, Jr. was involved in extending the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> out into the Indian country. In 1721, he was <a href="../../doc/1721inst.html">identified</a> as the captain of a company of traders commissioned by the governor to establish a trading post on Lake Erie near Niagara and to encourage the Iroquois to trade at Albany. After that, he was active at <a href="../../na/oswego.html">Oswego</a>, and passed a year at another location near Lake Ontario. In 1737, he was commissioned as "commissary at Oswego" during the trading season.</p>

<p>In November 1722, married young <a href="../g/cagroesbeck3268.html">Catharina Groesbeck</a>, the daughter of a prominent trader. By 1743, ten of their children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>These Schuylers set up a residence in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. Pieter served as a firemaster and then was elected assistant <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> in 1736 and '37. He also owned land along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.</p>

<p>Like his brothers, he owned a farm <a href="../../im/im1767.html">north of Albany</a> on family property generally known as <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">the Flats</a>.</p> 

<p>In July 1736, he was among those worthies who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willgvs3959.html">will</a> of Goose Van Schaick. In 1748, was <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler104.html">named</a> to share a portion of the estate of his brother, Phillipus. His <a href="pischuyler1737.html">son</a> was the "Pieter Schuyler, Jr." who was buried at "the Flats" in September 1753. At this point, we believe he was the "Peter Schuyler" whose name was included on a list of Albany freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1736">1763</a>.

<p>We seek information on his later life and passing. </p>
