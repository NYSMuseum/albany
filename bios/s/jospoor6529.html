<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Spoor</strong></a> was born in November 1713. He was the son of <a href="gespoor6527.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../g/magilbert5156.html">Mary Gilbert</a> Spoor.

<p>In 1719, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=yZNQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=%22johannes+spoor%22&source=bl&ots=-0x6ESHyGa&sig=GEkT9YJU80DkWuqC6sLpCuMvcRg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=kM5WUtndKoTo8gSP3oGYAg&ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22johannes%20spoor%22&f=false">identified</a> as the eldest son in the <a href="../../wills/willgespoor.html">will</a> filed by his father. About thirteen at that time, he is said to have been left his father's bible.

<p>This son of Gerrit and Mary Spoor was an Albany resident who <a href="../../res/guess.html">may have</a> lived for much of the remaining century. However, a number of similarly named contemporaries dictate caution in the assignment of qualitative information.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1735">1735</a>, he was named constable for the <a hef="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. The next <a href="../../org/cc.html#1736">year</a>, he was appointed high constable.

<p>In July 1748, "Johanes Spoor" was among the witnesses at the filing of the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> of a prominent third ward merchant.

<p><a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources note that his mother moved to New York following the death of Gerrit Spoor. But she may have been living in Albany as late as <a href="../../census1756.html#55">1756</a> and was keeping a "mead house." Perhaps Johannes was among those living with her.

<p>Even though this individual was in his forties, Johannes married Albany native <a href="../b/magbogert6122.html">Magdalena Bogert</a> in June 1757 at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1767, the marriage had produced four children. In June 1762, one of those children was buried from the church.

<p>A list of freeholders in Albany County dated <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6529">1763</a> included the name "john Spoor Jr." In 1766 and '67, Spoor's third ward holdings were <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> moderately. 

<p>In his early sixties at the outbreak of hostilities, in 1775 he pledged ten shillings for supplies for Ticonderoga. Perhaps he was the Spoor who was granted a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#6529">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#6529">1779</a> and later in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#6529">1788</a>, his holdings in the same general vicinity as earlier were valued modestly on city assessment rolls. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#6529">1790</a>, the third ward house of "John Spoor" included two men, two boys, and two females. Seven years later, a third ward freeholder <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1797bf">list</a> identified him as a "<a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">yeoman</a>." After that, his name no longer appears to have appeared in the community-based record.

<p>With identity <a href="../../res/guess.html">un</a>certainities, and unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the later life and passing of Johannes Spoor, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now. </p>
