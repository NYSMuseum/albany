      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Robert Sanders</b></a> was born in New Amsterdam 
        in November 1641. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland 
        pioneers</a> Manhattan tradesman <a href="thsanders1445.html">Thomas</a> 
        And Sara Van Gorcum Sanders. Like his father a silversmith, he shared 
        Thomas Sanders' business and assets on Manhattan and upriver in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>About 1665, he married <a href="../vkl/elvkleeck1048.html">Elsie Barentse 
        Van Kleeck</a> in New York. Shortly thereafter, the couple settled in 
        Albany while the enteprising Sanders tended to family interests in New 
        York and other locations as well. By 1683, the marriage had produced eleven 
        children. His father probably had died before 1669 when Robert Sanders 
        paid for the Albany burial of his mother.</p>
      <p>Although not a prominent <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trader</a> 
        himself, Robert Sanders gained repute as an interpreter and frontier diplomat. 
        During the 1680s, he served the new village/town of Albany as juror, assessor, 
        firemaster, constable, acting sheriff, and justice. He was rewarded for 
        these services with access to land in Dutchess County, north of the eastern 
        part of Rensselaerswyck (<a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>), 
        and elsewhere in the province of New York. By the end of the century, 
        he had sold most of those holdings which were the basis of the family 
        fortune.</p>
      <p>Although partially of English or Scottish ancestry, like his wife he 
        was a member and supporter of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. His <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home was an 
        <a href="../../census1679.html#1442">Albany landmark</a> referenced by 
        the term "Robert Sanders gate." 
      <p>In June 1695, the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pZwpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142&lpg=PA142&dq=%22capt.+weems%22+1695&source=bl&ots=1KhElqxzQY&sig=PPJxgeOOdTJiECefMWYF4ei1cG0&hl=en&ei=t-HBS_KrDsSclgel_fzcBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CAgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22capt.%20weems%22%201695&f=false">city 
        council</a> agreed with Sanders to provide lodging for <a href="../w/jaweems.html">Capt. 
        Weems</a>.</p>
      <p>For almost four decades, Robert Sanders was a prominent businessman, 
        <a href="#land">landholder</a>, attorney, and public servant in Albany 
        and to some extent in <a href="#nyc">New York</a> where he probably spent 
        the last decades of his life.</p>
      <p>Robert Sanders had filed a joint will with his wife in 1673. He filed 
        another <a href="#will">will</a> on his own in September 1702. He died 
        in 1703 and was buried in New York City.</p>
