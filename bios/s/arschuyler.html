<P><a href="#sources"><b>Ariaantie Schuyler</b></a> was born in March 1720. She was the daughter of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> residents <a href="nischuyler1730.html">Nicholas</a> and <a href="../w/elswendell2799.html">Elsie Wendell</a> Schuyler.</p>


<p>In January 1742, she married <a href="../vr/kvr5131.html">Killian Van Rensselaer</a> at the Schenectady Dutch church. By 1763, the marriage had produced nine children who were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. In 1746, she was named an heir in the will of her father.</p>

<p>Ariaantie and Killian raised their family on a large <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> farm located above the east bank of the Hudson. </p>  

<p>Ariaantie Schuyler Van Rensselaer died in October 1763 - four months after the birth of her child. She was buried from the Albany church. She had lived only forty-three years. Left with a large family, Killian Van Rensselaer re-married in 1769 and lived until 1781.</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> Because her parents were not Albany residents and her married life was centered in Greenbush, the life of Ariaantie Schuyler Van Rensselaer has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>.
