          <P><A href="#biography"><B>John Bradstreet Schuyler</B></A> was born 
            on July 12, 1765. He was the seventh child and eldest surviving son 
            of the fifteen offspring of the marriage of <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
            Schuyler</a> and his wife, <a href="../vr/cavr.html">Catharina Van 
            Rensselaer</a>. He was named for his father's mentor, Colonel <a href="#bradstreet">John Bradstreet</a>. </P>

          <p>"Bradstreet" grew up in colonial Albany's <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">largest 
            home</a> and at his father's country estate in <a href="#saratoga">Saratoga</a>. 
            During the 1770s and 80s, he began to understand that he would have 
            the opportunity to follow in his famous father's footsteps.
          <p>

<P>Already destined to receive <a href="#bradstreet">substantial property</a> near Albany, in 1783 he inherited a share in the Saratoga Patent. In 1787, he married <a href="../vr/elvr5075.html">Elizabeth Van Rensselaer</a>, daughter of the deceased <a href="../vr/svr5114.html">Patroon</a>. That marriage produced but two children.</P>

<p>By that time, "Bradstreet" had taken over management of his father's estate at <a href="#saratoga">Saratoga</a>. Prominently configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census of 1790</a>, the twenty-five-year-old landlord's Saratoga household included twelve males over sixteen and fourteen slaves. The next year, he was elected supervisor and assessor of the town of Saratoga in newly formed Saratoga County. In 1794, he was elected to represent Saratoga in the New York State Assembly.</p>

<p>Just past his thirtieth birthday, John Bradstreet Schuyler died at Saratoga on August 19, 1795. The body was brought to Albany where his <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1795jbs">funeral</a> the following day occasioned great interest. He was buried in the Van Rensselaer family vault.</p>

<p>Following "Bradstreet's" untimely death, the Schuylers never recovered their pre-eminent position in Albany society. However, his children were considered in the <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1750.html">will</a> filed by General Schuyler in 1804.</p>

            <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>John Bradstreet Schuyler</B> 
            is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 1447. This profile 
            is derived chiefly from <a href="../../sources.html#csg">family</a> 
            and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. In addition, 
            substantial biographical information has been gleaned from Don Gerlach's 
            <a href="phschuyler1750.html#biography">two major works</a> on John 
            Bradstreet's father.</p>

          <p><a name=bradstreet></a><a href="../b/jobradstreet.html">John Bradstreet</a>'s 
            <a href="../../wills/willjobradstreet.html">will</a> left his namesake 
            a farm along Albany's southern <a href="../../citylimits.html">border</a> 
            called "<a href="../../na/whitehall.html">Whitehall</a>." In 1789, 
            he sold the estate to Leonard Gansevoort. Having no sons, John Bradstreet 
            also left him his "army books and apparell."</p>

          <p><a name=saratoga></a>Old <b>Saratoga</b> is today's Schuylerville. Philip Schuyler 
            had established a country residence there prior to the American Revolution. 
            His father had "high hopes" for "Johnny" as an estate manager. Bradstreet's 
            coming of age enabled the General to direct his increasingly complicated 
            affairs from an <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Albany base</a> 
            of operations.</p>
