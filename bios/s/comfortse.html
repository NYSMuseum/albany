<P>This individual sometimes known as 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Comfort Severs</strong></a> signed the <a href="../../solconst.html#cs">constitution</a> of the Albany Sons of Liberty in 1766.

<p>At this point, his precise <a href="#name">name</a> and origins are still subjects for more determined inquiry. We believe he may have been of New England background. We have found no information regarding his marital status.

<p>In September 1766, he signed a <a href="../../res/realestate.html#lease">lease</a> for a lot where the barracks formerly stood. In 1769, he acquired an adjoining lot. He held that property on what became <a href="../../streets.html#chapel">Chapel Street</a> for a number of years. Perhaps, he was the "Mr. Siverson" who was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessed</a> in 1767 in the house of Gerrit A. Lansing. 

<p>Has probably was involved in the wood trades. He has been <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html#sources">identifed</a> as one of the carpenters who worked on <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">Schuyler Mansion</a> in 1761. In 1769, he was paid several times for making additions and other work on the <a href="../../im/im1770.html">Middle Dock</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 

 <P>By April 1781, Comfort Severs no longer held the lot in Albany. We do not know if he had died or had left Albany.</p>

The life of Comfort Severs has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. 
This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from 
<a href="../../guide/histres.html#reconpgm">family</a> 
and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. This <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.com/th/read/SEAVER/2000-02/0951709182">character</a> may have some relevance! This <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gfEKAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA271&lpg=PA271&dq=%22comfort+sever%22&source=web&ots=Gdpy39i-aS&sig=KRmxKfHUP1q5cX3syi4uIKi5ToQ">person</a> was a builder as well. Other contemporary inidviduals had similar names but none revealed an Albany context. Hopefully, more clarity is in our future!!

<p><a name=name>We have adopted this <a href="../../res/sp.html">spelling</a> of his surname because it is most frequently encountered in the community based <a href="../../cbr.html">record</a>.  Internet searches using his christian name have been more fruitful.
