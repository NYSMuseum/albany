<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled and referred to variously, one-time Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Scherp</strong></a> probably was born during the 1670s or early 80s. She may have been a member of the <a href="sharp.html">Sharp</a> family of Albany and its environs. However, for several reasons, her precise <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> are unclear at this time. 

<p>In 1702, "Katharina Scharp" married <a href="../b/ribrewer7414.html">Richard Brewer</a>, an Englishman, who at that time was an officer in the Albany <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a>. Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> records also noted that the service took place "at the groom's house" and that the bride was from "N.E." (New England). That source provides no further information on children or subsequent church connections.


      <p>Richard Brewer had passed on by May 1719 when widow Catharina married the somewhat 
        older widower <a href="phphschuyler.html">Philip Ph. Schuyler</a> at their 
        Albany church. That union was short-lived as Schuyler died in Schenectady 
        in 1724. 
<p>We <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now still seeking information on the later life and <a href="../../res/death.html">passing</a> of Catharina Scherp Brewer Schuyler.</p>
