      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Geertruy Schuyler</b></a> was born in February 
        1654. She was the first daughter and second child of New Netherland pioneers 
        <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse</a> and <a href="../vs/mvslicht.html">Margarita 
        Van Slichtenhorst</a> Schuyler. Her <a href="schuyler.html">family</a> 
        soon stood in the first rank in Albany business and landholding.</p>
      <p>In September 1671, she married Stephanus Van Cortlandt at the New York 
        City Dutch church. She moved to New York to become the wife of one of 
        the colony's most successful merchants. Thus their <a href="../../marriages.html">marriage</a> 
        had united two of the colony's foremost families. By 1698, fourteen of 
        their children were baptized in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>Van Cortlandt held many public offices including that of mayor of New 
        York City. He also acquired extensive acreage in Westchester County that 
        became known as Van Cortlandt Manor. His family only visited there - living 
        instead in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Stephanus Van Corltandt died in 1700 
        and Geertruy became executor of his vast estate. 
      <p>At some time after the summer of 1707, she was one of eight siblings named 
        in the <a href="../../wills/willmgtvslicht.html">will</a> filed by her 
        mother. 
      <p>Geertruy Schuyler Van Cortlandt died in New York in 1723.</p>
