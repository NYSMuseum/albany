<P>This <a href="#sources">Abraham Sickles</a> probably was born during the latter part of the 1770s. He was known as Abraham Sickles, Jr." - but probably was not the son of  the older Albany resident <a href="absickles7030.html">Abraham Sickles</a>.

<p>In October 1800, he married Elisa Johnson at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage is <a href="http://searches2.rootsweb.com/th/read/NYALBANY/2001-10/1003490661">said</a> to have produced fifteen children.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#7031">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household consisted solely of a young couple and was located near <a href="../../census1800.html#7030">that</a> of Abraham Sr. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">census</a> returns showed his household with five children - aging through the early 1800s. 

<p>By <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA87,M1">1813</a>, he (no longer Jr. and noted as still alive in 1854) seems to have settled on <a href="../../streets.html#liberty">Liberty Street</a> in the first ward. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a>. Over the next decades, he was identified as a constable, police constable, and high constable at a number of addresses in what became the Fourth Ward. 
<p>During the 1800s, he is said to have been a member and officer of Albany's Mt. Vernon <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Lodge</a>.

<p>Abraham Sickles, "long known as an efficient officer of the city police, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=%22abraham+sickles%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0SlmqpLkyr&sig=4rxKzunDI9KJZm6KqFcY_YHb3YU&hl=en&ei=tOKvSZzVKJjAtgeLgtntBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result">died</a>" in May 1861 at the age of eighty-one. </p>
