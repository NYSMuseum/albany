<P><a href="#sources"><b>Philip J. Schuyler</b></a> was born in December 1695. He was the first child born of the marriage of <a href="joschuyler100.html">Johannes Schuyler</a> and the widow <a href="elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats</a> Wendell Schuyler. At the time of his birth, his parents were raising more than ten children from Elsie's previous marriage. He grew up in his parents' Albany town <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">house</a> and on <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Schuyler farms</a> located along the river to the  north of Albany.</p>

<p>His wife was <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1747.html">named Margaret</a> but he probably died childless! Born to wealthy parents, he considered himself a "gentleman" living on Schuyler property he <a href="../../wills/willjoschuyler100.html">inherited</a> at old Saratoga. Those holdings included a farm and sawmill.</p>

<p>He filed a <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1747.html">will</a> in June 1739. It characterized him as "being very sick" and also provided for his <a href="mgtschuyler.html">siblings</a> and their children.</p> 

<p>Philip J. Schuyler was killed during the French and Indian <a href="../../peace.html">raid</a> on Saratoga on November 28, 1745. He was less than a month shy of his fiftieth birthday.</p>
