<strong>Zacharias Sickles</strong></a> was born about 1670. He was the son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="zasickles5648.html">Zacharias</a> and Anna Van Valkenburgh Sickles. His parents were Albany residents at the time of his birth. However, by the early 1690s, his father had re-located their family to New York.

<p>In June 1692, he was identified as a <a href="../../garrison.html">soldier</a> in Captain <a href="../b/gebradshaw.html">George Bradshaw</a>'s company for the city and county of New York. As Bradshaw's command also extended upriver, we hope to uncover evidence that Sickles served at Albany.

<p>This Zacharias married twice. In 1693, he wed Maryken Jans of New York City. In June 1717, he was identified as a widower from Albany when he married Wyntie Dyckman, the widow of Johannes Cornelisse of Albany. The first marriage produced a number of children. They do not seem to have been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

<p>In August 1698, he was identified as a blacksmith where he received the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ya8FAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=%22burghers+and+freemen%22&source=web&ots=W4zL6h-NDG&sig=jgYAaGL-vhXYjpAzBa2ydE2OjSg#PPR7,M1">Freedom</a> of New York City.  

<p>Zacharias Sickles seems to have left Albany for good during the 1690s. We <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> definitive information on his later life and passing. Perhaps he <a href="http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=:3143441&id=I566">died</a> in 1729.
