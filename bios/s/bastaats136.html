<P><a href="#sources"><b>Barent Staats</b></a> was born about 1681. He was the eldest son of sometime Albany residents <a href="jostaats4558.html">Jochem</a> and <a href="../r/anrynd.html">Anna Rynderts</a> Staats. In April 1712, he was granted <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=x7EFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=whereas+joachim+staats&source=bl&ots=--NFP8gOba&sig=0Bz2B-uXlJEf3oNhcaGbmiMu1c0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwicleaMuv3XAhXJ4iYKHRCHCPcQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&q=whereas%20joachim%20staats&f=false">letters of administration</a> on the estate of his father who, at that time, was thought to have died intestate.</p>


<p>He married <a href="../vd/covdb5749.html">Neeltie Vandenbergh</a> in December 1701. By 1725, their ten children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were frequent baptism sponsors.  </p>

<p>This Staats family settled in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where his house was assessed in 1702. In 1707, he was appointed assessor but he had relocated to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and so was replaced. In 1711, he was <a href="../../corporation.html">elected</a> assistant alderman for the first ward and served one term.</p>

<p>Barent Staats served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany militia</a>. In November 1709, he was identified as a Lieutenant and as a prisoner in Canada who was to be exchanged. In 1715, he was listed as "Coronet" in John Schuyler's <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">Troop</a> of horse.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. He appears to have lived on Staats Island and elsewhere south of Albany where he owned extensive <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>.</p>

<p>Barent Staats filed a <a href="../../wills/willbastaats.html">will</a> in January 1748. It left a substantial estate to his wife and nine living children! He died in July 1752 and was buried at the "Hoghbergh."</p>
