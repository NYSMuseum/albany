<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jacob Schermerhorn</strong></a> (sometimes Jacob C.) was born in October 1696. He probably was the first son of the marriage of <a href="coscher5455.html">Cornelis</a> and his first wife, Maria Van Buren Schermerhorn. His father was an Albany businessman and trader who left his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> home and re-located to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> just after 1720.

<p>In May 1718, Jacob married <a href="../b/anbeekman3894.html">Anna Beekman</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1740, at least six children had been christened in Albany and in churches down the Hudson Valley. This Jacob Schermerhorn was a church member and an officer in more than one location.

<p>In 1715, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1721">1721</a>, he was named firemaster for the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1723">1723</a>, he was appointed constable. 

<p>Like his father, Jacob also had an eye on property in the southeastern part of the county. At some point, he also resided on Livingston Manor. However, in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#5469">1742</a>, his name appeared on a list of freeholders living in Albany's second ward.

<p>Jacob Schermerhorn filed a <a href="../../wills/willjascher5469.html">will</a> in November 1760. At that time, he was living on Livingston Manor. He named sons and daugher but no wife was mentioned. He was dead by the following July when the will passed probate.</p>
