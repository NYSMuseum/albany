          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Elsie Staats</B></A> was born during the late 1650s, 
            the daughter of <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> physician 
            <a href="abstaats.html">Abraham Staats</a> and his wife, <a href="../w/cawessels6863.html">Catharina 
            Jochems</a>. As a child of one of the community's few professionals, 
            Elsie grew up alongside <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/elsstaats99.jpg" width=175 align=right border=1 hspace=4 vspace=4 alt="Elsie Staats Wendell Schuyler"></a> 
            other first generation Americans - the children of Albany's <a href="../../nnd.html">founders</a>.</p>

          <p>About 1677, she married <a href="../w/jowendell2942.html">Johannes Wendell</a> 
            - a widower and son of an Albany <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trading</a> family. The first of their nine children was born in 1678. Their State Street home was 
            noted on the <a href="../../census1679.html#jowendell">census of householders</a> 
            taken in 1679. Wife of one of a prominent and successful businessman, 
            Elsie's life was dealt a crushing blow by the untimely death of her 
            husband early in 1692. A widow with eleven living children including 
            an infant and two stepdaughters from Wendell's first marriage, Elsie 
            was not yet forty years old.</p>

          <p>She was <a href="../../wills/willjowendell2942.html">named</a> principal beneficiary and executor of Wendell's estate. But that inheritance was jeopardized 
            when, in April 1695, she married <a href="joschuyler100.html">Johannes 
            Schuyler</a>, the thirty-six-year-old youngest son of Albany foremost 
            family. Eight months later, her son Philip Schuyler was baptized in 
            the Albany Dutch church. Their household with eleven children stood 
            out on the city <a href="../../census1697.html">census of 1697</a>. 
            By 1704, she had given birth to three more Schuyler children. Her 
            union with a considerably younger Johannes Schuyler stands out among 
            <a href="../../marriages.html">early Albany marriages</a>. However, 
            it endured for forty-two years.</P>  

          <p>Elsie's family was inordinately large and quite complex. During the 
            1700s, it settled into the landmark <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler 
            House</a> in the heart of an <a href="../../art/art-ote.html">emerging 
            Albany</a>. Her Wendell stepdaughters had passed on. The Wendell 
            children were reaching maturity and taking their places throughout 
            the region and beyond. Now middle-aged, prosperous Johannes Schuyler 
            was appointed mayor of Albany in 1703 and elected to the provincial 
            Assembly in 1710. He was also the patriarch and patron of a large 
            city-based family. Attended by many servants, Elsie shared her husband's 
            business interests and also his affinity for the <a href="../../drc.html">Albany 
            church</a> - where she had witnessed two dozen baptisms by 1731.</P>

<p>Perhaps living into her eighties, Elsie Staats Wendell Schuyler died in June 1737 and was buried from the Albany Dutch church  with the notation "wife of Johannes Schuyler." She was the mother of at least fifteen Albany children and the stepmother of two others.</p>

          <p><a name=portrait></a>This <b>portrait</b> of a matronly Elsie Staats 
            has been <a href="../../images/jpg/jandeschuyler.jpg">sewn together</a> 
            with a portrait of her second husband. It has been widely reproduced 
            and is in the collection of the <a href="http://www.nyhistory.org/">New-York 
            Historical Society</a> This unusual double painting was painted prior 
            to Elsie’s death in 1737. Both portraits probably were done by Scottish-born 
            artist John Watson. In 1741, the double portrait was noted in Johannes 
            Schuyler's <a href="../../wills/willjoschuyler100.html">will</a> filed in 1742.</p>
