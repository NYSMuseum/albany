<strong>Peter Sharp</strong></a> was born about 1735. He was the son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents Jurrian and Barbara <a href="../../res/sp.html">Sh</a>arp. This individual was an Albany resident and should not be confused with at least another same-named contemporary living in greater Albany County.

<p>In October 1762, he married <a href="../b/caberr.html">Ca</a>therine Berringer at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. His second wife was <a href="../d/madonn.html">Ma</a>ry Donneway. The two marriages produced at least five children. Peter was a member and trustee of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> Church in Albany. Beginning in 1766, he also was a regular baptism sponsor at the Dutch church.

<p>From the mid1760s on, this Peter Sharp was an Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#7015">mainstay</a> - moving from the first to the third <a href="../../wards.html">ward</a> by <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7015">1788</a>. He was a <a href="../../trades/wood.html">carpenter</a> who was paid by a number of clients for work done on buildings in and around Albany. His frequent work for the city government included constructing drains and cisterns. Late In 1775, his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?ct=result&id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22peter+sharp%22+albany&ots=wwfHdUsgnv&pg=PA324&lpg=PA324&q=peter+sharp#PPA269,M1">account</a> with the city for more than eighty-nine pounds was ordered to be paid. In May 1781, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA324&lpg=PA324&dq=%22peter+sharp%22+albany&source=bl&ots=wwfHdUsgnv&sig=bS2hDD2T7o5yBPyMVOZZwwQqAT8&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result">allowed</a> a parcel of land to satisfy a debt owed him by the city government. Assessment <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">rolls</a> showed his Albany holdings to be of moderate value. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7015">1800</a>, his third ward household included only a young boy and a man and a woman - both born before 1756.

<p>In February 1773, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=jFAOAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA494&lpg=RA2-PA692&dq=%22peter+sharp%22+albany&source=web&ots=Fjmd4SpdIc&sig=kDyt91AG-R7_P8D2aJ4ydq8c8eA&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result#PRA3-PA692,M1">identified</a> as the "barracksmaster at Albany" when he was paid from the Provincial treasury.

<p>As a middle-aged tradesman, he would be expected to have been kept home during the War for Independence. He served on the homefront despite being suspected of being "unfriendly to the American Cause." Afterwards, he was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#7015">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>During the 1780s, he continued to perform building and repair work for the <a href="../../corporation.html">city government</a>, sold land, and also leased the city docks in 1786. In 1788, he was a <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#7015">member</a> of the Albany Antifederal committee.

<p> In 1803, he was a founding member and officer of the Albany St. Andrew's Society. 

<p>Peter Sharp died in May 1813 at the age of seventy-eight. He was buried in the Presbyterian plot. The first Albany city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a> gave his address as 8 <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> - near the original northern boundary of the city. His widow lived at that location or closeby until 1821.</p>
