<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Philip Jeremiah Schuyler</strong></a> was born in January 1768. He was the son of <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../vr/cavr.html">Catharine Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler. He grew up in the middle of the large family of Albany's leading citizen at <a href="../../loc/schuylermansion.html">homes</a> in the city and on family properties in the countryside.

<p>Philip Jeremiah married twice. He wed Sara Rutsen in May 1788. She died in 1803. In February 1807, he married Mary Ann Sawyer. By 1811, the two marriages had produced eight children.

<p>By mid-1799, Schuyler family business in Claverack and its environs had been <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lhByzTg62dEC&pg=PA352&lpg=PA352&dq=%22philip+jeremiah+schuyler%22&source=bl&ots=vJQa5ZLuab&sig=G8uHRs6KbnucAzpfY1ePBW1S96g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bLQwUan6AoLZ0wHO6oDwCg&ved=0CGQQ6AEwCTgU#v=onepage&q=%22philip%20jeremiah%20schuyler%22&f=false">entrusted</a> to Philip Jeremiah.

<p>In 1803, he was named co-executor of his father's <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1750.html">will</a>. Upon Philip's death, he became guardian of his fatherless nephews and received substantial properties at <a href="../../na/sarapat.html">Saratoga</a> and in the city of Albany.

<p>However, by that time, he had left Albany and settled <a href="../../na/na.html">elsewhere</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, his household was configured on the census for Dutchess County in Rhinebeck. In 1798, he was a member of the New York State Assembly. In 1817, he was a Federalist member of the United States House of Representatives. He then retired from public life and returned to his Dutchess County farm.
 
<p>Philip Jeremiah Schuyler died in February 1835 (reputedly of tuberculosis) in New York City. He was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6942133">buried</a> in Poughkeepsie. He had lived sixty-seven years. We have <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> followed his adult life closely as it was not closely connected to the development of his native city.
