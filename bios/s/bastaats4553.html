<strong>Barent G. Staats</strong></a> was born in May 1762. He was the son of Albany and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> residents <a href="gestaats4569.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../b/debeekman3885.html">Debora Beekman</a> Staats. He grew up on the family farm located on Staats Island. He was known as "Barent G. Staats."

<p>In March 1789, he married Albany native <a href="../c/cacuyler382.html">Catharina Cuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1814, at least nine of their children had been christened in Albany. 



<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#4553">1790</a>, his new family was accounted for in a house in Albany's second ward. He was a grocer and merchant and involved in several Albany-based partnerships. His first home and store were on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>. He owned and rented a number of properties within the city limits. He was elected assistant alderman for the second ward in 1793.

<p>In 1807, he inherited family property across the river from his father.

<p>By 1813, he had relocated to North <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a>. Subsequent <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> identified him at a number of addresses on Market - although he may have lived in the same building for some time.

<p>During the 1790s and 1800s, he was involved in a number of <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transactions involving lots on Maiden Lane, Lion Street, and near the river. 

<p>Barent G. Staats died in August 1840 at the age of seventy-eight. His widow lived until 1852.</p>
