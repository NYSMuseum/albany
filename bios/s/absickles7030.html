<strong>Abraham Sickles</strong></a> was born in June 1737. He was the son of Zacharias and Anna Sickles. He probably grew up in Albany.

<p>In April 1767, he married Maria Rannel (Cannel or Crannel) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1785, eight children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#7030">1788</a>, his personal property was accorded only the barest assessment and was listed with others at the end of the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#7030">1790</a>, his household consisting of eight people was configured on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census and was located beyond the northern <a href="../../loc/northend.html"> border</a> of Albany. A decade later, he was <a href="../../census1800.html#7030">living</a> in the second ward. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">Assessment rolls</a> valued his house and lot on <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a> also in the second ward but gave his personal property only a minimal assessment.

<p>The emergence of a much younger <a href="absickles7031.html">Abraham Sickles, Jr.</a> by <a href="../../census1800.html#7031">1800</a> (not his son but also in the second ward but later on the South side) complicates the assignment of additional qualitative information.
  
<p>However, this Abraham Sickles probably had passed on before 1810. Perhaps his widow, "Mrs. Mary Sickles" <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=R5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=%22mary+sickles%22+albany&source=bl&ots=GtKcXq_CKF&sig=pamFJqohzyw4Jc8nVlLe9Wbnf1I&hl=en&ei=d-GvSe2XKJjAtgfagdXtBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result#PPA186,M1">died</a> in May 1829 at the age of eighty-nine (making her an age cohort of Abraham).</p>
