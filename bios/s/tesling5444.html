<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Teunis Slingerland</strong></a> was born in October 1757. He was the first-born son of Abraham and Rebecca Viele Slingerland. He grew up with four younger brothers on a <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Ren</a>sselaerswyck farm <a href="../../im/im1767.html">loc</a>ated <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">south</a> of the city of Albany. As a number of same-named contemporaries are <a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&q=%22teunis+slingerland%22&oq=%22teunis+slingerland%22&aq=f&aqi=g-K1&aql=&gs_l=hp.3..0i30.1225.4902.0.5177.20.20.0.0.0.0.157.1776.16j4.20.0...0.0.alBU_OmOQx8&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=5c7e5ae966ea494d&biw=1584&bih=547">at risk</a> in greater Albany County, we exercise <a href="../qqqq.html">caution</a> in the assignment of qualitative lifecourse information.  

<p>In April 1779, he (Theunis Abr.) married Albany native <a href="../h/mgthansen4984.html">Margarita Hansen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1786, the marriage had produced four children. In April 1791, perhaps this "Teunis Slingerland" married again - this time to Maria "Malice/Neulie" at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church. If so, by 1793, that marriage appears to have produced two additional children.

<p>Coming of age at the end of the 1770s, we expect to be able to further document his <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> experiences. Afterwards, he was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#5444">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. However, the name of a "Teunis A. Slingerland" appeared on the <a href="http://www.americanwars.org/ny-american-revolution/albany-county-militia-3rd-regiment.htm">roster</a> of the Third Albany County Militia Regiment and was identified as a "Captain."  Perhaps, still a different "Tunis Slingerland" (maybe a son) was associated with a <a href="../../friends.html">loyalist</a> regiment.

<p>In July 1784, he was among the five sons and two daughters who joined their mother as heirs in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6lIOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA284&lpg=PA284&dq=%22abraham+slingerland%22&source=bl&ots=Unaz2zEO9Y&sig=z0-ANFyZCxslhRXxV0ZtIk1Rl4s&hl=en&sa=X&ei=bYiuT-zLDIHr0gHHic2HDA&sqi=2&ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20slingerland%22&f=false">will</a> filed by Abraham Slingerland, who identified himself at that time as a Rensselaerswyck <a href="../../trades/yeoman.html">yeoman</a>. Abraham was dead by January 1786 and "Tunis" was to receive a share of the residual estate following the death of his mother. 

<p>On several occasions in 1785, Teunis was paid from the city treasury.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#watervliet">1790</a>, three individuals <a href="../../res/sp.html">named</a> "Teunis Slingerland" were identified as heads of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> households.

<p>Tunis was listed on a cumulative roster of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a> from the first quarter of the nineteenth century.

<p>However, in <a href="../../census1800.html#5444">1800</a>, the third ward household of Teunis Slingerland included five people who may fit the ages of this individual and his family. 
<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1s-xzokpAkkC&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=%22tunis+slingerland%22+merchant&source=bl&ots=i1kr_Y38XL&sig=zUofTl6Fn7VVZXF6kMc_b-jM55M&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ubyvT-iCKsOw6AH8qvGNCQ&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22tunis%20slingerland%22%20merchant&f=false">1802</a>, Tunis Slingerland advertized that he kept furniture made by <a href="../m/jomeads.html">John Meads</a> at his shop on Market Street.

In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22slingerland+tunis%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22slingerland%20tunis%22&f=false">1813</a>, the home of merchant "Tunis Slingerland" was listed in the first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> at 55 Market Street in the city's <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north end</a>.



<p>We seek defining information on the subsequent life and passing of the Albany resident named Teunis Slingerland. With many <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> remaining, we move on for now.</p>
