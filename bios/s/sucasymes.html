<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Susanna Catharine Symes</strong></a> was the eldest daughter of <a href="lasymesjr.html">Lancaster Symes, Jr.</a> and <a href="../l/mgtlydius.html">Margarita Lydius</a> - daughter of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch domine</a> in Albany. She probably was born during the 1730s but not christened in her mother's church. We seek defining information her birth. She probably spent considerable time in Albany as her father pursued a number of diverse opportunities in the region where her mother's <a href="../l/lydius.html">family</a> was well established.

<p>In March <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dlMOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=%22lancaster+symes%22&source=web&ots=roCNVCOjIN&sig=YF2sDMX93dIyYtFZq_fhn9v-PtQ#v=onepage&q=%22lancaster%20symes%22&f=false">1741</a>, she was named in the will filed by her father - at that time a "New York gentleman." Also named were a brother, a <a href="elsymes.html">sister</a>, and a number of Albany-based associates.

<p>By 1754, she had become the wife of the Reverend <a href="../o/jogilvie.html">John Ogilvie</a>, then rector of <a href="../../stpeters.html">Anglican church</a> in Albany, a missionary to the outlying parishes, and to the Iroquois.

<p>In September 1758, she <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=iRtEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22Susanna+Catarina+Oglevie%22&source=bl&ots=qwI0-jQaNJ&sig=kbANfKWwmqH9Ky78AxH9oUn2ebE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjQgsj_wbvMAhVJPz4KHf5KBP4Q6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=%22Susanna%20Catarina%20Oglevie%22&f=false">witnessed</a> the Albany christening of her sister's daughter along with a brother-in-law.

<p>Her children (including son and future cleric <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=cF5EAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA72&lpg=PA72&dq=symmes+oglivie&source=bl&ots=FWlx7EhJJs&sig=PDARXJ0Vp5kO4Y-MivkAVtJHbxQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwipkOuCw7vMAhUEaz4KHf0HCwIQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=symmes%20oglivie&f=false">George Ogilvie</a>) appear to have been christened in New York
 
      <p>Susanna Catharine Symes Ogilvie was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vv4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA170&lpg=PA170&dq=ogilvie+symes+marriage&source=bl&ots=PT6LAnHtjD&sig=D7nHHWH0W7PaVquR4MMHphaUmAM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwizndLKnLnMAhVJFT4KHZx6BOMQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=ogilvie%20symes%20marriage&f=false">dead</a> 
        before April 1769, when her husband remarried.</p>
