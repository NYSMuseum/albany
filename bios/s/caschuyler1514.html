<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catherine Schuyler</b></a> was born in September 1743. She was the daughter Manhattan residents of Brant and Margarita Van Wyck Schuyler. She was the older sister of Elizabeth "Ann Eliza" Schuyler Bleecker. In July 1752, she was left an equal one-fifth share of her father's estate. Brandt Schuyler died later in the year.</p>


<p>In January 1762, she married Albany-born skipper <a href="coswitts5656.html">Cornelis Switts</a> in New York City. By 1776, the marriage had produced seven children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. This Switts family lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. By 1790, however, they had moved away from the river and into the second ward.</p>

<p>Catherine Schuyler Switts was counted in her husband's second ward household on the <a href="../../census1790.html#5656">census</a> in 1790. Her husband died in March 1791. Catherine passed sometime afterwards!</p>
