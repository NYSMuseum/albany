<p><b>David Pieterse <a href="#Schuyler">Schuyler</a></b> was a pioneer member of early Albany's most important <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> family.</p>

<p>He was born in Holland in 1636, a younger son of German-born Amsterdam baker Pieter Diercks and Geertruy Philips van Schuyler. He spent the first decade and a half of his life in Amsterdam. By the mid-1650s, he had emigrated to New Netherland with his older brother, <a href="phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse</a>.</p>

<p>Settling in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, the Schuylers initially were carpenters but quickly found fortune in <A href="../../furtrade.html">trading for furs</a>. By 1660, both brothers were listed among the <a href="../../lists/list1660.html">principal fur traders</a> of the community.</p>

 In 1657, he married <a href="../vp/cavplanck.html">Catalina Ver Planck</a> - the daughter of a New Amsterdam trader. Settling along the Albany waterfront near the north gate, David Schuyler traded for furs and for countryside produce. His marriage produced eight children between 1659 and 1678. He was a member and officer of the Albany <A href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church.</a></p>

<p>After serving in a number of civic positions during the 1660s, '70s, and early 1680s, in 1686, this <A href="../../cityfathers.html">city father</a> was appointed alderman under the Albany <a href="../../charter.html">city charter</a>. He served as alderman for the <A href="../../wards.html">third ward</a> until his death. </p>


<p>David Pieterse filed his <a href="../../wills/willdapschuyler.html">will</a> in May 1688. Calling himself a merchant of Albany City, he named his wife Catalina as executor and chief beneficiary. Also mentioned were his eight surviving children. To them he left his two Albany houses and other property. He died in February 1690 - according to bible records two days after fleeing from the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady massacre</a>. He lived about fifty-four years.</p>
