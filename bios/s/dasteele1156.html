<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Daniel Steele</strong></a> was a frontier trader living in Albany during the decade before the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence.

<p>Early in <a href="../../solconst.html#1156">1766</a>, his signature appeared on a constitution for the Albany Sons of Liberty. Later that year, his first ward home was valued on an Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment roll</a>. He was referred to as "Mr. Steele." 


<p>Over, the next half decade, his activities as a <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a>, agent, courier, and general businessman were documented in the published <a href="../../sources.html#jp">papers</a> of his patron, Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>. His most frequent Albany associates were <a href="../../newcomers.html">newcomer</a> Scots.

<p>He may have been alone while in Albany as no family information has been found in the records of contemporary <a href="../../churches.html">Albany churches</a>.


<p>We are less certain of the other parts of his life. Perhaps he was the descendant of <a href="http://worldconnect.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=tyrilla&id=I9080">Daniel Steele</a> (1697-1788) of Connecticut. Was he the "Daniel Steele" who signed a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~canmil/uel/loytry2.htm">petition</a> to partition Albany County in 1771 or who was present at a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~nyoneida/misc/wager/ch5.html">meeting</a> held in Caughnawaga (Fonda) in January 1778? He also may have been the ancestor of <a href="dansteele.html">Daniel Steele</a> - the Connecticut native who had a bookstore at <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson</a> and Court Streets in 1800.</p>
