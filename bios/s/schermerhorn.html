<P>The <a href="#sources">Schermerhorns</a> of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> settled across what became the province of New York but were primarily located in the <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> and Albany area. American patriarch <a href="jajscher5448.html">Jacob Janse</a> emigrated from the province of "Schermerhorn" in North Holland to <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> perhaps as early as 1637.

<p>Although he <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">left</a> a large family, in the years before 1800, only a few of his descendants actually <a href="../../criteria.html">lived</a> in the city of Albany.

<p>The French and Indian <a href="../../7yw.html">attack</a> on Schenectady in February 1690, claimed a number of family lives, temporarily scattered other family members, and anointed the galloping <a href="syschermerhorn.html">Symon Schermerhorn</a> as a legendary <a href="http://www.dutchsettlerssociety.org/apps/photos/photo?photoid=99287542">folk</a> character. 

<p>The most historically notable member of the family, <a href="rjscher5490.html">Ryer Jacobse</a>, lived in his Albany house (perhaps with his brother <a href="syschermerhorn.html">Symon</a>) following the burning of Schenectady. A younger brother, <a href="coscher5455.html">Cornelis</a>, was an Albany-based trader. Their sisters, <a href="macscher5483.html">Machtelt</a> and <a href="coscher5488.html">Cornelia</a>, married Albany prominent Albany residents.

<p>By <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, the family had regrouped in the lower Mohawk Valley as three Schermerhorn men were <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KWtAAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA371&lpg=PA371&dq=schermerhorn&source=bl&ots=XY1o32cMNc&sig=5FJqwiZqqwiv1bKK-wXUwfGHPLc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=N-GuU-2SDYLeoAT8yoHYAQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&q=schermerhorn&f=false">counted</a> among the freeholders of Schenectady, two in Rensselaerswyck, and one more in Kinderhook. 

<p>By mid-century, Schermerhorns were active in Mohawk Valley business, farming, and real estate but were conspicuously scarce in the records for those activities connected to Albany. A <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/families/schermerhorn/chronicles/3a.html">branch</a> of the family became even more prominent in New York City and its environs.


<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, the first Federal census identified no Schermerhorn named households in the city of Albany. However, four Schermerhorn addresses were configured in surrounding <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. Sixteen family households were <a href="http://www.schenectadyhistory.org/census/1790/nameindex_n_z.html#S">counted</a> in Schenectady. Statewide, almost sixty Schermerhorn households were listed.

<p>The first <a href="../../sources.html#ad">City Directory</a> in 1813 <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA85&lpg=PA85&dq=%22schermerhorn%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=snippet&q=schermerhorn&f=false">identified</a> Cornelius Schermerhorn, Jr. as an innkeeper at 12 Beaver Street. After that, the name of this first <a href="../../nnd.html">family</a> of New Netherland is less prominent in the Albany community-based record.</p>

<p>Named for New York businessman and shipowner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Schermerhorn">Peter Schermerhorn</a> (1784-1826) who erected six urban counting houses on Fulton Street in 1811, today <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schermerhorn_Row_Block">Schermerhorn Row Block</a> in lower Manhattan commemorates the family's long and varied history in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schermerhorn_(disambiguation)">New York State</a>.
