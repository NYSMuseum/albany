<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Isaac Swinton</strong></a> was the <a href="../../corporation.html">first</a> recorder (or deputy mayor) appointed under the original Albany <a href="../../charter.html">city charter</a> in July 1686. However, he died unexpectedly in July 1687 and the sole <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA215&lpg=PA215&dq=%22isaac+swinton%22+1686&source=bl&ots=cNtS0KicSR&sig=Y8kySqgNeQbMS_aIOJeGJg7QvvE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jzMBU9iHKsS7oQTTl4GgBA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20swinton%22%201686&f=false">reference</a> to him actually being in Albany on September 14, 1686 may be in error. By October 1686, he had been replaced as recorder by Albany insider <a href="../t/dwtbroeck32.html">Dirck Wesselse</a>. This sketch compiles available information on this original <a href="../../cityfathers.html">city father</a>.

<p>Perhaps, he was born about <a href="http://www.swintonfamilysociety.org/web%20charts%20Jan%202005/Royal-Wright/SINTON_Ch1.pdf">1653</a> and thus would have been the youngest son of John and Lady Margaret Stewart Swinton/<a href="../../res/sp.html">Sinton</a> of Ireland. If so, his wife was Elinor. Perhaps, the couple had two sons. We surmise that he was an officer or officer holder under proprietary and royal governor Thomas Dongan and seek more definitive information on Isaac's <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to colonial New York.
 
<p>In December <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/nj/statewide/history/colrec/vol21/v21-02.txt">1682</a> and in April 1683, Isaac Swinton was among those who witnessed wills in New Jersey.
 
<p>In October <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-h0ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=%22isaac+swinton%22&source=bl&ots=FSsMfZW9Vw&sig=zMVhTNvtO3yMlSUy6ZNv0e35Os8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SuTLUuqSCojboASnl4DYBw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20swinton%22&f=false">1685</a>, he was among those who had petitioned for land at Flushing, Long Island. Early in 1686, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=I5Q-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA110&lpg=PA110&dq=%22isaac+swinton%22&source=bl&ots=1FPFwaspYf&sig=0rO6BuZBeMXC1wf53vjnIDGXda0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l-fLUuCmOI7hoATSo4CYCQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20swinton%22&f=false">among those</a> identified as a patentee of the Queens town of Newtown.

<p>In December <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-h0ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22isaac+swinton%22&source=bl&ots=FSsMfZW9Vw&sig=zMVhTNvtO3yMlSUy6ZNv0e35Os8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SuTLUuqSCojboASnl4DYBw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20swinton%22&f=false">1685</a>, he was appointed provincial clerk of the chancery. In November <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-h0ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47&dq=%22isaac+swinton%22&source=bl&ots=FSsMfZW9Vw&sig=zMVhTNvtO3yMlSUy6ZNv0e35Os8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SuTLUuqSCojboASnl4DYBw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20swinton%22&f=false">1686</a>, he was identified as clerk of the provincial council and was sworn to secrecy. A singular biographical <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/documentsrelativ11newy#page/407/mode/1up">notice</a> styled him "Deputy Secretary of the Province . . . and clerk of the Chancery."

<p>On July 7, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=-h0ZAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22isaac+swinton%22&source=bl&ots=FSsMfZW9Vw&sig=zMVhTNvtO3yMlSUy6ZNv0e35Os8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=SuTLUuqSCojboASnl4DYBw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20swinton%22&f=false">1687</a>, the provincial council minutes revealed that Swinton was deceased and that he was to be replaced in his various clerkships.

<p>Isaac Swinton died in July 1687. On July 16, provincial Attorney General James Graham <a href="#not">notified</a> the colonial office of his passing. As he apparently left no will, in October 1687, his principal creditor, <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~havens5/p16885.htm">W</a>illiam Nicoll, was appointed administrator of his estate.

<p>This provincial placeholder was in New York for less than a decade. <a href="../../res/guess.html">Per</a>haps Governor Dongan appointed him to the recorder's office to be his representative in Albany. His early death put an end to such possibilities. Swinton Street in today's <a hrer="../../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor Hill</a> probably is named in his honor - although few living today would know why!</p>
