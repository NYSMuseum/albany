<P><a href="#sources"><b>Machtelt Schermerhorn</b></a> was born during the early 1660s. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="jajscher5448.html">Jacob Janse</a> and Jannetje Seegers Schermerhorn. She grew up in her father's Albany <a href="../../census1679.html#5448">house</a>. In 1688, she was left a share of her father's <a href="../../wills/willjajscher.html">estate</a>.</p>


<p>About 1683, she married Albany resident <a href="../b/jombeekman3858.html">Johannes M. Beekman</a>. By 1689, four children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members.</p>

<p>While the Schermerhorns were actively involved in the establishment of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a>, these Beekmans lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. Johannes Martense was known as a blacksmith and businesman, traded in real estate, and served the municipal government.</p>

<p>Their marriage, however, was short lived as Beekman re-married in October 1692. Machtelt Schermerhorn Beekman probably died following the birth of her last child in January 1689. She probably lived less than thirty years.</p>
