<strong>Isaac Sturges</strong></a> probably was born after 1750. Several origins in New England (especially in Connecticut) seem plausible. However, one family-based resource <a href="http://files.usgwarchives.net/pa/fayette/bios/gresham/tvbios.txt">claimed</a> that all the Sturgises (including a number of Isaacs) in the United States were descended from three brothers who came from England during the eighteenth century. 

<p>In November 1777, he married twenty-two-year old  <a href="sasmith.html">Sally Smith</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. A number of their children were christened at the Albany Presbyterian church during the 1780s and 90s.

<p>Church records identified him as a <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sailor</a> and sloopman. 

<p>He seems to have served in the Revolutionary army. His name appeared among the enlisted men on the <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_3d_reg.htm">roster</a> of the Third Regiment of the New York <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">Line</a>. By the time of the Clinton Sullivan Expedition in 1779, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_d-7u-XP290C&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=%22isaac+sturges%22&source=bl&ots=8dQXNCONJ6&sig=BSNSniiTSNvthe9SgrbbuBqj3p4&hl=en&ei=HXBtS-HvDIyY8AbttdyJBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CA8Q6AEwBDge#v=onepage&q=%22isaac%20sturges%22&f=false">listed</a> as a sergeant. We seek evidence of any service bounty awards.

<p> In <a href="../../census1790.html#isst">1790</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> household included five members. A decade <a href="../../census1800.html#isst">later</a>, four children were living with the aging couple. His name seems to be missing from the Albany census for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a>. Assessment rolls beginning in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#isst">1779</a> described his house and lot in/on <a href="../../streets.html#fox">Fox Street</a> in the second ward.  

<p>In 1795 and 1796, city records identified him as the city watchman. In 1813 and 1814, an Isaac Sturgis was listed in the city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directory</a> as a constable for the second ward. However, his particular address was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22sturgess%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22sturgess&f=false">not</a> included in the alphabetical listings.

<p>By <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924030336261/cu31924030336261_djvu.txt">1798</a>, he had become an officer in the Albany <a href="../../org/masonic.html">Masonic Lodge</a>.

<p>Isaac Sturges buried his wife in December 1807. He does not appear to have re-married. After that, he probably was absorbed within the Albany <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22sturgess%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22sturgess%22&f=false">households</a> of his adult children.
