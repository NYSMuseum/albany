      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Jacob Staats</b></a> was born about 1650. He was the 
        son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="abstaats.html">Abraham</a> 
        and <a href="../w/cawessels6863.html">Tryntje Wessels</a> Staats. His 
        generation of American-born children firmly established the <a href="staats.html">Staats 
        family</a> in colonial Albany and beyond!</p>

<p>As the eldest son of early Albany's most prominent physician, Jacob Staats became a surgeon as well. He probably took over his father's practice, served the Albany <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a>, and treated patients at the behest of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Like his father, he owned a Hudson River sloop, but he too was primarily a surgeon - serving his neighbors, soldiers, and those sent to him by the church!</p>

 By <a href="../../census1679.html#4595">1679</a>, he was identified as an Albany householder. He owned a number of other parcels within the city as well. This Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#023">mainstay</a>, also served city <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a> as assessor, assistant, and alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.<p></p>



<p>Jacob Staats married twice. His first wife was <a href="#ryckie">Ryckie</a>. Their children were baptized in the Albany Dutch church where he was a member and one-time deacon. Following Ryckie's death in 1709, he married the widow <a href="../r/irlydius4613.html">Isabella Rachels</a>  Lydius. A marriage contract dated January 3, 1711, specified the terms of the union!</p>

<p>Jacob and Isabella lived together in their first ward <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#4595">home</a> for the next two decades as Albany <a href="../../peace.html">evolved</a> from its frontier to regional center phase! 



<p>Jacob Staats filed a <a href="../../wills/willjastaats.html">will</a> in September 1734 calling himself a <a href="../../trades/medical.html">surgeon</a> of Albany city and  that he was "very sick." An extensive estate was divided among his heirs. He died in February 1735 and was buried from the Dutch church.</p>
