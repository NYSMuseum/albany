<P>According to <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/Cynthia_Steele_records.ashx?pid=30852529">family-based</a> resources, <strong><a href="#sources">Cynthia Steele</a></strong> was born in September 1770. She was the daughter of Ashbel and Rachel Skinner Steele of Hartford, Connecticut. Her father was <a href="http://www.theancientburyingground.org/history/burial_list_map.php">buried</a> there in 1790.



<p>In April 1796, Cynthia was in Albany where she married printer and publisher <a href="../w/crwebster6841.html">Charles R. Webster</a>, the widower of her late <a href="rasteele.html">older sister</a>. These Websters were members (Cynthia actually joined in 1810) of the the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. By 1811, their marriage had produced at least seven  children, two of whom were <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=%22cynthia+webster%22+steele&source=bl&ots=x7A_XN8NAp&sig=sOrtQ4nKaneGTCAOB9zfJihWACw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Yn6mT4_NI8ye6QHbrsnXBA&ved=0CFcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22cynthia%20webster%22%20steele&f=false">buried</a> from their church in 1808 and 1809. 

<p>These Websters lived on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#6847">1800</a>, their household had grown to house  fourteen members probably including Cynthia's widowed mother who died in 1804.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=%22c+webster%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22c%20webster%22&f=false">1813</a>, the city directories described her as the Manager of the Albany Ladies Society.

<p>Cynthia lost her husband in July 1834. Widow Cynthia Steele Webster <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_opPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA182&lpg=PA182&dq=%22cynthia+webster%22+albion&source=bl&ots=D3nXgy4j8y&sig=HfPU8Km7O5_3z7emCQw54NUUoEc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=5-CnT_DgIsaH6QHS_pzNBA&ved=0CE8Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22cynthia%20webster%22%20albion&f=false">died</a> in Albion, Orleans County in December 1848. She had lived seventy-eight years. Their youngest son was a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=NUlnMpHqpA8C&pg=PA12&lpg=PA12&dq=%22cynthia+steele%22+webster+albany&source=bl&ots=dFqhuyJxjG&sig=bmnAjGze8RHAJhuYCozTnnvlWU8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KYymT_T5Gcf46QH68JyiBA&ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22cynthia%20steele%22%20webster%20albany&f=false">prominent</a> Albany cleric.</p>
