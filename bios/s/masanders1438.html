            <B>Maria Sanders</B></A> was born in October 1749. She was the daughter 
            of Albany merchant and civic leader <a href="rosanders1443.html">Robert 
            Sanders</a> and his second wife, <a href="elschuyler1274.html">Elizabeth 
            Schuyler</a> Sanders. Both her parents were dead before Maria reached 
            adulthood but Robert Sanders's <a href="../../wills/willrosanders1443.html">will</a> 
            provided her with a negro wench, clothing, silver and jewelry, and 
            a share of his very substantial estate.</P>

          <P>So endowed and shy of her nineteenth birthday, Maria Sanders married Greenbush 
            native <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip Van Rensselaer</a> in February 
            1768. This union of the offspring of elite families produced twelve 
            children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> between 1768 and 1794 where both parents were members and 
            pewholders.</P>

<p>These Van Rensselaers lived in the family house on Pearl Street but Philip  was more and more interested in developing the farm south of the city - where the family spent more and more of their time.</p>

<p>Philip's business and then Revolutionary War-related duties often took him away from home. Maria's substantial role in her young husband's affairs is <a href="../../sources.html#lhg">revealed</a> in letters and business papers.</p>
 
<p>After the war, the family settled more into their Cherry Hill property. Maria's children grew up on the expanding farm - leaving them with a sense of place that endured throughout their lives.</p>

<p>Maria buried her husband in March of 1798. As executor and chief beneficiary of Philip Van Renssealaer's estate, the forty-eight-year-old widow shouldered responsibility for the continued development of Cherry Hill. Surrounded by her large family and attended by a half dozen slaves, Maria managed the farm and even added to those holdings.</p>

<p>By the end of 1814, she had sold away her second ward property. Maria lived out her days at Cherry Hill. She died in 1830 - shy of her eightieth birthday. Her will was probated in 1831.</p>
