<strong>John Shaw</strong></a> was born about 1760. He most likely was the son of Albany and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> ropemaker and innkeeper <a href="neshaw1124.html">Neal Shaw</a>.

<p>Young Shaw <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">served</a> in the Revolutionary army attaining the rank of lieutenant of artillery. He served in that capacity from 1781 to the end of the war. Afterwards, he was accorded a land bounty right in conjunction with the third or Rensselaerswyck regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. He applied for a pension in 1825 and the <a href="../../or/pension/penjoshaw.html">application</a> detailed and documented his service. 

<p>In September 1783, John Shaw married <a href="../d/isdenniston5138.html">Isabella Denniston</a> at the <a href="../../na/khook.html">K</a>inderhook Dutch church. His bride probably was the daughter of his father's one-time <a href="../d/hdenniston5136.html">partner</a>. The marriage produced a large family.

<p>In July 1786, he was identified in the <a href="../../wills/willhdenniston.html">will</a> filed by his father-in-law.

<p>Initially, this Shaw family made its home outside the city limits - <a href="../../loc/northend.html">probably</a> along the river road leading toward the Van Rensselaer <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">Manor House</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#josh">1790</a>, his <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> household included five children. A decade later, the Watervliet <a href="../../census1800.html">census</a> return accounted for eight children and three slaves. In 1801, he purchased a grocer's license <a href="../../corporation.html">from</a> the city government. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1809tl">1809</a>, "Shaw & Denniston" were assessed for thirty-two feet of dock space in the third ward while his house and lot on Maiden Lane were valued separately.

<p>As the northern border of the city was extended north, beginning in 1815, his residence at <a href="../../streets.html#market">North Market</a> Street was listed in the Albany city <a href="../../sources.html#ad">directories</a>.  It showed his address at 67 North Market and his shop at 4 <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> in close proximity to the ropemaker's waterfront customers. His occupation was given as "ropemaker."

<p>In 1825, his pension application stated that his wife was feeble and infirm and that their twenty-eight-year-old daughter, Maria Shaw, looked after the family concerns as most of their six offspring (as young as nine-years-old) who lived with them were not in good health. 


<p>John Shaw died in July 1826 at the age of sixty-six. A newspaper notice mentioned his Revolutionary war service. His will passed probate in July 1826. His widow lived on at 67 North Market until her death in 1838.
