<strong>Sara Sanders</strong></a> was born about 1670. She was the daughter of <a href="rosanders.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../vkl/elvkleeck1048.html">Elsie Barents</a> Sanders. She grew up in the large family of a Scottish-born entrepreneur who was able to maintain homes in a number of New York locations including a trading <a href="../../census1679.html#1442">house</a> in Albany. Both her parents survived until after 1700 - providing a substrantial family umbrella .

<p>In May, 1686, she married <a href="../g/hegrav8235.html">Hendrick Graverat</a> of New York at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a lifelong member. By 1699, three children had been christened in Albany and New York. Her husband died in March 1699. Sara recorded his passing in the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible18.htm">family bible</a>. 


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#1444">1709</a>,  her small family was living in Albany as "Sara Greveraet's" name was on the assessment roll as the owner of a modest <a href="../../wards.html#1"> first ward</a> property. 

<p>In June 1727, her <a href="../g/isgrav8238.html">son</a> wrote in the <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/bible18.htm">family bible</a>, "Sara Gravenradt, my bleoved mother, has had a raising cough for eleven years now increased. It breaks my heart when I hear this sad cough. I feel that my mother is passing from me."
  

<p>"Sara Greveraedt" was buried from the Albany church later that month. Her son thought that she had lived fifty-eight years. Her children and grandchildren established the Graverat family in Albany and beyond.</p>
