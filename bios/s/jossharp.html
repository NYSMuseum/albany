<P>Despite little direct evidence, we believe that this individual <a href="../../res/sp.html">known</a> as Joseph Sharp was a "free" member of the early <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">Afro         Albanian</a> community.

<p>From the <a href="http://newyorkgravestones.org/view.php?id=54968">inscription</a> on his <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln=Sharp&GSiman=1&GScid=63827&GRid=86011689&">gravestone</a>,we know that <a href="#sources"><strong>Joseph Sharp</strong></a> was born about 1748. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and the first five decades of his life.

<p>On November 8, 1803, he purchased the freedom of "Cate," from <a href="jostevenson2244.html">John 
        Stevenson</a> for $150. At that time, she was called "his wife." On November 
        20, he was identified as a barber. On November 27, he married Cate Stevenson 
        at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal Church in Albany. 
      <p>Otherwise, his activities have not yet been encountered in our sweeps 
        of community based records. 
      <p>A headstone inscription found in the African Methodist Episcopal plot 
        of the "<a href="../../dead.html">removed stones</a>" at <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany 
        Rural Cemetery</a> noted his passing on November 27, 1813 and that he 
        had lived sixty-five years. His will passed probate on November 30, 1813.

 <a name=sources></a> <strong>Sources:</strong> The life of Joseph Sharp has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. With so little qualitative information currently at hand, we recognize that this profile is pre-mature. An <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&q=%22joseph+sharp%22+albany">Internet search</a> has brought up a number of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?num=100&hl=en&safe=off&rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US&q=%22joseph+sharp%22+negro">intriguing</a> but as yet-not-connected leads. We can only wonder at any connection to the Sharp family of early Albany. </div>
