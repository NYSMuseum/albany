<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources">
<strong>Ezra Shaw</strong></a> was born prior to 1755. He was an Albany resident at least from the 1780s until about 1800. We seek information on his background and reasons for settling in Albany.

<p>He was married and raised an Albany family. However, we have not connected him or his family to Albany churches. Perhaps (and this may be a shot in the dark) he <a href=http://genweb.whipple.org/d0361/I90206.html">married</a> Hannah Copeland in Abington or Braintree, Massachusetts in 1767. In 1799, his wife was identified as a member of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#ezsh">1790</a>, his second ward household included seven people. Two years, earlier, his personal property was taxed along with the other boarders listed at the end of the second ward <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#ezsh">assessment roll</a>. In 1799, he was identifed as a tenant of David Waters. In <a href="../../census1800.html#ezsh">1800</a>, his second ward household consisted of three children and a couple over forty-five years old. After that, his name dropped from early Albany rolls.
 

<p>In 1815, an individual named Ezra Shaw was one of the new <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nysteube/guy/pg8.html">residents</a> of Hornby, Steuben County.
