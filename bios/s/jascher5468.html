<strong>Jacob J. Schermerhorn, Jr.</strong></a> was born in December 1685. He was the eldest son of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>-based skipper Jacob Schermerhorn, and his wife, Gerritje Van Buren Schermerhorn.


<p>In June 1714, he married <a href="../vv/anvvechten2380.html">Anna Van Vechten</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1737, eleven children had been christened in Albany and <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. <a href="../../res/ts.html">Tr</a>aditional sources state that his family was even larger.

<p>Even before his marriage, he held property in Albany and was assessed in the first ward in <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#5468">1709</a>. He also was paid for work on the city stockade in 1716.

<p>However, these Schermerhorns made their home in the Schodack section of the manor of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> where he was identified as a freeholder in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>.  


<p>In 1765, he was deposed for a hearing regarding a <a href="jostaats4558.html#will">will</a> that his father may have witnessed many decades earlier. He testified that his father had been a doctor. At that time, Jacob J. Schermerhorn, Jr. was said to have been about eighty-two years old.</p>
