      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Abraham Staats</b></a> was born in Holland about 
        1618. His parents were Isaac Staats and Sara <a href="../../res/sp.html">L</a>auwers 
        of Amsterdam. He <a href="../../nnd.html">came</a> to New Netherland in 
        1642. He was the founder of the <a href="staats.html">Staats family</a> 
        of early Albany and its environs.</p>
      <p>Before leaving for New Netherland, he had married baker's daughter <a href="../w/cawessels6863.html">Tryntie 
        Wessels</a>. The marriage produced at least seven children including a 
        <a href="abstaats4551.html">namesake</a> - with whom his life is sometimes 
        confused. By the 1660s, he had become a member and officer of the Albany 
        <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>
      <p>At the time of his arrival, he was identified as a twenty-four-year-old 
        <a href="../../trades/medical.html">surgeon</a> employed by the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Van 
        Rensselaers</a> under a six-year contract. He served as such during the 
        1640s. During that time, his house was located within <a href="../../loc/fortorange.html">Fort 
        Orange</a>. Then, he was a householder and <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#staats">prominent 
        fur trader</a> in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and then 
        Albany.</p>
      <p>In 1664, Abraham Staats was among those New Netherlanders who took the 
        <a href="../../nat.html">oath of allegiance</a> to England. He was listed 
        with Albany householders in <a href="../../census1679.html#staats">1679</a>. 
        His home was on the east side of Market <a href="../../im/im1686.html">and</a> 
        State Streets - south of the brewery. He owned several other parcels in 
        Albany, an island near Castleton called "Staats Island," and extensive 
        acreage in the vicinity of Claverack. He <a href="#skipper">skippered</a> 
        a yacht on the Hudson and served as a magistrate. He also was referred 
        to as "Major."</p>
<p>Abraham Staats filed a <a href="../../wills/willabstaats.html">will</a> in April 1683. It named his wife and then six living children as his heirs. The patriarch was dead by October 1694 when the will passed probate. His widow survived for another decade.</p>
