      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Margarita Schuyler</b></a> was born in January 
        1701. She was the second youngest daughter of <a href="joschuyler100.html">Johannes 
        Schuyler</a> and the widow <a href="elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats</a> 
        Wendell Schuyler.</p>
      <p>She was raised by a mother who was in her fifties and grew up in the 
        <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">Schuyler house</a> in Albany and 
        at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">family farm</a> where she 
        enjoyed the company of a large extended family. In December 1720, she 
        married her cousin <a href="phschuyler.html">Phillipus Schuyler</a> at 
        the Albany Dutch church. Her husband was the son of her father's brother! 
        Unlike most early Albany <a href="../../marriages.html">unions</a>, the 
        marriage was childless.</p>
      <p><a href="../../im/im1767.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/sflatspruyn.jpg" alt="Madame Schuyler's home at the Flats" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=2 width=170></a> 
        Although she had inherited an Albany house from the <a href="../../wills/willjoschuyler100.html">estate</a> 
        of her father, her home was on the family farm located north of Albany 
        known as <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">the Flats</a>. The couple 
        improved the property and it became a country retreat for family members 
        and a hospitable accommodation for <a href="../../res/visitors.html">vis</a>itors 
        from all over the colonies. General <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip 
        Schuyler</a> was one of many Schuyler nephews and nieces (and their children 
        as well) who spent considerable time at the Flats and who were nurtured 
        by "Aunt" Schuyler.</p>
      <p>Her husband filed a <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler104.html">will</a> 
        in 1748 naming her to be a major benefactor of his large estate as long 
        as she remained a widow. Colonel Phillipus Schuyler died in February 1758. 
        By that time, fifty-seven-year-old Margarita had become known as "Madame 
        Schuyler" and was renowned as a hostess and matriarchal figure in Albany 
        social circles. Her life is the subject of <a href="../m/annemcvickar.html">Anne 
        Mc Vickar Grant's</a> detailed but nostalgic <a href="../../art/grant.html"><i>Memoirs 
        of an American Lady</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Into her eighties, Margarita Schuyler Schuyler filed a <a href="../../wills/willmgtschuyler1488.html">will</a> 
        in February 1782. She died at the Flats on August 28 at the age of eighty-one 
        and was buried in the family plot. Her will passed probate early in 1783.</p>
