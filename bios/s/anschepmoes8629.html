<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Schepmoes</b></a> was baptized in New Amsterdam in February 1642. She was the daughter of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> Jan Janse and Sarah Pieters Schepmoes.</p>

<p>About 1660, she married tailor/businessman <a href="../c/hecuyler533.html">Hendrick Cuyler</a>. About that time, the couple moved upriver to Beverwyck/Albany. Her large family established the Cuyler family in colonial New York. Like her husband, Anna was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. </p>

<p>Although Hendrick Cuyler prospered in the Albany business environment, about 1688, these Cuylers returned to New York City where he died in 1690. Anna was permitted use of his entire estate while she remained a widow. Although often deferring to her now adult children, she continued to conduct business through the end of the decade. At the same time, she maintained her home on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> in Albany although it was <a href="../../census1697.html#121">occupied</a> mostly by various numbers of her eight surviving children.</p>

<p>Anna Schepmoes Cuyler died in New York City. Her will passed probate in March 1703. </p>
