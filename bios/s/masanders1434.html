<P><a href="#sources"><b>Maria Sanders</b></a> was born during the 1660s. She was the daughter of <a href="rosanders.html">Robert</a> and <a href="../vkl/elvkleeck1048.html">Elsje Van Kleeck</a> Sanders. Her father was a colonial entrepreneur with homes in New York and Albany. His family spent time in both locations.</p>

<p>Only <a href="bsanders1368.html">one</a> of her brothers survived to raise a Sanders family. But two of Maria's sisters connected the family to Albany society through marriage.</p>


<p>In November 1689, she married Albany native <a href="../r/geroseboom1609.html">Gerrit Roseboom</a>. By 1704, six of their children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and baptism sponsors.</p>

<p>These Rosebooms lived in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</A> - near other family members whose homes were close to "Roseboom's Gate." Successful members of the Albany business community, they were Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#157">mainstays</a> throughout a marriage that lasted more than fifty years.</p>  



<p>Maria Sanders Roseboom lost her husband in 1739. She died two years later in July 1741.</p>
