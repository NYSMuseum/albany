<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dirck Schuyler</strong></a> was born in March 1740. He was the only surviving son of the eight children born to the marriage of <a href="jaschuyler1327.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="gestaats4585.html">Geertruy Staats</a> Schuyler. His parents raised what turned out to be a small family in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> of Albany. Jacobus died in 1760 but widow Geertruy lived much longer. A number of same-named but only <a href="#named">roughly contemporary</a> individuals dictate caution in the assignment of qualitative information. This sketch focuses on the life of city resident Dirck Schuyler (1740-1806) who sometimes was called "Dirck Schuyler, Jr." 

<p>In April 1764, Dirck married Manhattan resident <a href="../vd/mavdu.html">Maria Van Deusen</a> at the Dutch church in New York City. At that time, he was called "Dirck Schuyler, Jr." By 1775, their four children had been <a href="../../drc.html">christened</a> in Albany where the parents were frequent baptism sponsors beginning in 1772.

<p>These Schuylers raised their family in a <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home that was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">valued</a> moderately on city assessment rolls. However, in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1270">1788</a>, his personal property was assessed under the third ward holdings of Captain <a href="../r/jarob1163.html">James Robichaux</a>.

<p>During the 1760s, Dirck was a <a href="../../lists/list1767acc.html#1270">member</a> of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. He also held a number of <a href="../../corporation.html">civic</a> appointments. Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1769">1769</a>, he served as constable, watchman, and firemaster in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In June 1771, the Albany <a href="../../ag.html">paper</a> noted that one "Robert Mostean" had a clothing shop in Schuyler's Albany house.

<p>Dirck Schuyler was known as a <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">skipper</a>. In September 1776, his sloop "from Albany" was <a href="http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/cgi-bin/amarch/getdoc.pl?/var/lib/philologic/databases/amarch/.22838">directed</a> to evacuate the sick from New York to Orangetown by General James Clinton. He <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:7O20HQ3T98sJ:www.csce.org/images/1946_10_TheRiverObstructionsoftheRevolutionaryWar_Part1.pdf+%22dirck+schuyler%22&cd=92&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us">seems</a> to have had additional wartime experiences as <a href="../qqqq.html">well</a>. During those years, he was a property <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1270">owner</a> in the second ward.

<p>In May 1778, he was among those Albany people who signed a <a href="../../doc/petbenrogers.html">petition</a> to the governor for the release of a condemned horse thief. Perhaps, it was his name on an <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_levies_albany.htm">incomplete roster</a> as an enlisted man for the <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">war</a>time Albany militia regiment. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=tZALAAAAIAAJ&dq=heitman+officers&printsec=frontcover&source#v=snippet&q=schuyler&f=false">1782</a>, he was identified as an ensign in the second regiment of the New York Line who <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=C2l0CGSz_S8C&pg=PA259&lpg=PA259&dq=%22dirck+schuyler%22+ensign&source=bl&ots=gN7xanYAPn&sig=JR4nmDZ3QMA60R2Ikcitx3a8_tg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V6oZUs2fMIn48wSOu4HADw&ved=0CFcQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=%22dirck%20schuyler%22%20ensign&f=false">served</a> at least until the end of the war. A Dirck Schuyler served in the artillery afterwards.

      <p>In January 1783, <a href="../../ag.html">a</a> newspaper advertised the sale 
        of his sloop. 
      <p>In 1786, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1G4oAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA347&lpg=PA347&dq=%22dirck+schuyler%22&source=bl&ots=i0zrDnj-53&sig=fKcKXYFwK9BXnA3MFByg-Ox8iyc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iodxUMK-Aqb30gHjo4HYDg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=%22dirck%20schuyler%22&f=false">identified</a> as "of Albany" and as the nephew and heir of the late Dirck Schuyler of New York in the will filed by widow Ann Mary Schuyler of New York. His son also was named as an heir. 

<p>His wife was dead by March 1787 when their children were provided for in the <a href="http://archive.org/stream/collectionsofnew38newy#page/164/mode/2up">will</a> filed by her father. "Direck" was identified as "of Albany."

<p>Appearing for the first time as a head of household in <a href="../../census1800.html#1270">1800</a>, his family included only an man and woman, one girl, and a slave. 

<p>Dirck Schuyler was buried "gratis" from the church late in December 1806.</p>

<p><a name=named></a>At least two other Dirck Schuylers cause us concern. Dirck of NYC (1700-1788) and Dirck (1761-1811) who may have been the officer in the New York Line. Perhaps, yet another Dirck Schuyler, a New Jersey loyalist, lost his holdings <a href="../../friends.html">via</a> confiscation.
