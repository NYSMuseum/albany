<P><a href="#sources"><b>William Shepherd</b></a> was an English-ancestry cutler who settled in Albany prior to the Revolutionary War. Previously (1772), he had been a "jobing smith and cutler" in New York City in partnership with an individual named Sebastian Lucas.</p>

<p>His wife was named Jane - the matriarch of their large family. William Shepherd was a member and vestryman at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's Church</a> although the baptisms of his children have not been found in its extant records.</p>

<p>Initially petitioning for land adjoining (north east of) <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, by the outbreak of hostilities he had established a residence on the hill in Albany. Over the next two decades, he became an Albany mainstay - although his conduct and fate during the Revolutionary War make him an early Albany        enigma.</p>

<p>His ability to fashion swords and knives made him particularly valuable 
        to the revolutionaries. Beginning in 1775, he was paid by the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany 
        committee</a> for making and repairing bayonets. But in May 1776, he was 
        identified by the Albany committee as "notoriously disaffected." Upon 
        request, he refused to sign the non-importation "Association." He was 
        ordered to be disamed and the weapons in his possession were seized. He 
        was confined but later released after posting a bond.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#1155">1779</a>, his named appeared 
        on first ward assessment rolls. 
      <p>In the years that followed, William Shepherd continued to fashion and 
        fix knives, swords, and bayonets for the American cause. At one time he 
        captained a company of "armourers" under <a href="../vr/pvr.html">Philip 
        Van Rensselaer</a>. He was exempted from military duty because he was 
        employed in the public service. In 1780, he sought to be exchanged (sent 
        to the British). But that application was denied. Afterwards, he was not 
        among those granted a "<a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a>" 
        in conjunction with the Albany miitia regiment. <a href="../../guide/histres.html#ar">App</a>arently, other same-named individuals were so honored.</p>
<p>With the end of the war, he resumed his trade. He also earned monies by performing services for the Albany government. During the 1780s, he resumed his quest for land near <a href="../../na/hoos.html">Hoosick</a>. During those years, his first ward property was valued on the city <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#1155">assessment</a> roll with a boarder noted in his house.</p>

      <p>In 1790, he was listed on the <a href="../../census1790.html#1155">census</a> 
        as the head of a household on upper <a href="../../loc/statestreet.html">State 
        Street</a> just below the stately home of fellow former loyalist <a href="jostevenson2244.html">John 
        Stevenson</a>.</p>
      <p>William Shepherd filed a <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html">will</a> 
        in March 1794. It named his wife and seven children as his heirs. His 
        estate included farm lands in Saratoga County and an extensive account 
        of debts due him. He died in April and was buried from the Albany Dutch 
        church. The will passed probate that December.</p>
      <p>In 1834, the obituary of his daughter, <a href="mashepard.html">Mary</a> 
        Clench, called her father <a href="#aa">"</a>a distinguished armorer for 
        American forces in the Revolution although himself a loyalist!"</p>
