<strong>Mary Shepard</strong></a> was born about 1766. She was the only daughter among several brothers in the family of <a href="wmshep1155.html">William</a> and Jane Shep<a href="../../res/sp.html">h</a>ard. Her father was a propserous metal artisan whose background and British contacts caused him great difficulties during the Revolutionary conflict. Mary grew up in a home on upper State Street near the English church. 

<p>By 1790, she had become the wife of Schenectady resident <a href="../c/bclench7653.html">Benjamin V. Clench</a>.  Beginning in that year, their children were christened in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church where both parents were members. 

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#1155">1790</a>, the newlyweds were most likely living in the upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> home of her father. In March 1794, she was named in William Shepherd's <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html">will</a>. Following her father's death later in the year, the Clenches took over the family residence at what would be known as 88 State. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7653">1800</a>, their household counted twelve members - probably including her widowed mother.

<p>Benjamin V. Clench was a notable <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22clench,+benjamin%22+editor&source=bl&ots=2hLtKZXz3A&sig=9NTru5Wrei0KFns50SW-7HNQkNY&hl=en&ei=Mw4cSpuJFo3KM46L0JoP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6">auctioneer</a> who later re-located his family to South Pearl Street.

<p>Mary Shepard Clench died in February 1834 at the age of sixty-seven. Her husband survived for several years afterwards.
