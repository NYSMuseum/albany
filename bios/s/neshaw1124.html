<P><a href="#sources"><b>Neal Shaw</b></a> probably was born in the 1730s. He may have been the son of John and Sarah Shaw. A number of ropemakers named <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22neal+shaw%22+rope&start=0&sa=N">Neal Shaw</a> lived in New York and New England during this individual's lifetime.</p>

<p>Early in 1758, Neal Shaw was issued a New York marriage license to wed Mary Decline (de Klein). They were still together in 1777 when they witnessed a baptism in Albany. We seek additional church and family information for him!

<p>By the 1760s, his name began to appear on affidavits in New York and in the Albany area where he was identified as a ropemaker. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> house and property were included on the Albany assessment roll. His city holdings were valued at a fairly substantial twelve pounds.</p>

<p>Over the next decades, he continued to make and sell rope. He also was identified as an innkeeper in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> - perhaps in association with innkeeper and landholder <a href="../d/hdenniston5136.html">Hugh Denniston</a>.</p>

<p>Although he was called before Albany <a href="../../coc.html">committees</a> during the War for Independence, he was allotted a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany city regiment of the county militia. In 1777, his "place" in or near Albany was referenced by the Albany committee. His son, <a href="joshaw.html">John Shaw</a>, was an officer in the revolutionary army, married Denniston's daughter,  and followed his father as a ropemaker.</p> 

<p>In April <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BdkRAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA323&lpg=PA323&dq=%22neal+shaw%22+rope&source=bl&ots=wwjCdTyces&sig=Zizqs_7_Ht7dhQCYznt86BZbkc4&hl=en&ei=8cgjS_vAEcPKlAfMmoWDCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CBYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22neal%20shaw%22%20rope&f=false">1781</a>, the Albany city council purchased a rope from him. In March 1784, innholder Neal Shaw and another individual <a href="http://www.schist.org/library/deeds/DeedFile.htm">sold land</a> in Rensselaerswyck to John Brown of Albany.

<p>In November 1785, he was among the witnesses to the filing of Denniston's <a href="../../wills/willhdenniston.html">will</a>.

<p>But by 1785, Neal Shaw 
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=GBWxAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA176&lpg=PA176&dq=%22neal+shaw%22+rope&source=bl&ots=8cWUSiOB5o&sig=Bf69VmxYPsFr8kWDxKFcpKIXYMQ&hl=en&ei=8cgjS_vAEcPKlAfMmoWDCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CA4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22neal%20shaw%22%20rope&f=false">may have removed</a> to New York City where his ropemaking and other business was referenced in the laws enacted by the New York State legislature. That individual had died <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=FB4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA389&lpg=RA1-PA389&dq=%22neal+shaw%22+rope&source=bl&ots=YrwXw6VGna&sig=fSLqNJqt-SD5psG__Y2WwofbovM&hl=en&ei=VNkjS9OlJ4qzlAeaovCCCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBIQ6AEwBDgy#v=onepage&q=%22neal%20shaw%22%20rope&f=false">intestate</a> in 1785. 

<p>In 1802, a ropemaker named <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OfgBVf_jO3AC&pg=PA185&lpg=PA185&dq=%22neal+shaw%22+rope&source=bl&ots=YM2TUnFIRV&sig=RT5pvDRbkgm7A51GKelY-DQabcM&hl=en&ei=y8sjS7HBC8POlAeY7b2MCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CCAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22neal%20shaw%22%20rope&f=false">Neal Shaw</a> built a house in Portland, Maine. The subject of most of this sketch would have been in his seventies by that time.</p>
