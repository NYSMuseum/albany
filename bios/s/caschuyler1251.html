<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catherine Cochran</strong></a> was born in February 1781. She was the youngest daughter of <a href="phschuyler1750.html">Philip</a> and <a href="../vr/cavr.html">Catherine Van Rensselaer</a> Schuyler. Her father's bible noted that Catherine was the fifteenth child born to his marriage. She is best known as Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler, the <a href="../../victorian.html">leg</a>endary "<a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/A_godchild_of_Washington.html?id=LF4SAAAAYAAJ">godchild of Washington</a>."

<p>In May 1803, Catherine married Samuel Bayard Malcolm. The marriage produced four children before he died in 1817. In 1822, she married New Jersey James Cochran, a cousin and the son of her <a href="geerschuyler1282.html">aunt</a> and one of her father's wartime <a href="../c/jocochran.html">compatriots</a>. That union is said to have produced a child. 

<p> In 1803, she was named among the heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willphschuyler1750.html">will</a> filed by her father. She was left a fair and proportional share of his very large estate that included real estate and monies.

<p>Catherine's marriages took her from the Schuyler property in Old Saratoga, to Montgomery County, to Utica, and finally to Oswego. Both her husbands were landed sons of prominent Revolutitionary era families. Descriptive material on both her life with both husbands can be found in <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/A_godchild_of_Washington.html?id=LF4SAAAAYAAJ"><i>A Godchild of Washington</i></a>.

<p>In August 1856, she was a widow and a resident of Oswego when she filed her <a href="#will">will</a> in that city. That detailed document specified the partition  and disposition of her substantial estate. 

<p>Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler Malcolm Cochran died in August 1857. She was buried in the Riverside Cemetery in Oswego.</p>
