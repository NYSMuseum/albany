<P>Referred to <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iously (Rosina), <a href="#sources"> <strong>Rosanna Shipboy</strong></a> was born about 1772. She was the daughter of <a href="tshipboy5686.html">Thomas</a> and the widow <a href="../w/anwilliams1120.html">Anna Williams</a> Van Vechten Shipboy. She grew up in the heart of Albany's <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>time business district. 

<p>In 1797, she marrried Albany native <a href="../v/sebvisscher.html">Sebastian Visscher</a>. Perhaps as many as seven children were christened by them in Albany churches. She was a member of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>These Visschers raised their family in a <a href="../../census1800.html#4172">State Street</a> home. Sebastian was a prominent attorney and office holder.

<p>In April 1822, she was identified as the only living member of Thomas Shipboy's family when the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q5YMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA167&lpg=PA167&dq=%22sebastian+visscher%22+thomas+shipboy&source=bl&ots=xs_D7kA75X&sig=flEqz2W117xaE-p1BmjVPfSPGaI&hl=en&ei=nSbdTbuZFYfdgQf8qpT2Dw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=7&sqi=2&ved=0CDQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22sebastian%20visscher%22%20thomas%20shipboy&f=false">newspaper</a> referred to some Shipboy family silver that was stolen in 1778 was dug up on a hill west of the city.

<p>Sebastian Visscher passed on in October 1824. After that, Rosanna probably stayed on at 100 North Pearl Street - the landmark home of her <a href="../f/lyfryer2220.html">mother-in-law</a>.

<p>Rosanna Shipboy Visscher died in March 1838 at the age of sixty-five.</p>
