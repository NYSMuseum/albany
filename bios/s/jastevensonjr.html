<P><a href="#sources"><b>James Stevenson, Jr.</b></a> was the younger son of <a href="jastevenson3901.html">James</a> and <a href="../g/sagrdyck.html">Sara Groenendyck</a> Stevenson. He probably was born during the mid-1730s. He was the younger brother of <a href="jostevenson2244.html">John Stevenson</a>, a prominent Albany merchant.</p>

<p>His name is conspicuously absent from the <a href="../../cbr.html">community record</a> where his father and brother were Albany leaders and regularly referenced. However, in 1768 he was listed as a communicant at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church.</p>

<p>In 1763, he was identified in the <a href="../../wills/willjastevenson.html">will</a> filed by his father and was left a monetary bequest. In November, a codicil to the will advanced James £1,000 Sterling. 

<p>This James Stevenson seems to have been a military officer and frontier contractor. The <a href="../../sources.html#jp">papers</a> 
        of Sir <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a> include many letters 
        and references to him including his statement that he had <a href="#marriage">married</a> 
        "an Amiable Seneca" woman in November of 1769. At that time, he was "in 
        command" at Niagara. Another <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=W2B-iMV5NN0C&pg=PA136&lpg=PA136&dq=%22james+stevenson%22+niagara&source=bl&ots=JYVYWS0ZTj&sig=3NcSdOqvSKq2tIzP-0b7afvQmGY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBxMO66aXZAhUQ71MKHX-UAAEQ6AEISDAJ#v=onepage&q=%22james%20stevenson%22%20niagara&f=false">source</a> has identified him as a surgeon there. In 1770, 
        he was a captain in the 60th Regiment on duty at Detroit.</p>

<p>In 1774, he was identified as "of Albany" and named co-executor of Johnson's <a href="../j/swj.html#will">estate</a>. He frequently corresponded with Johnson.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1775, he applied to the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> for a pass to go to Canada. His request was denied twice.</p>

<p>Perhaps he returned to Albany after the war. However, he does not seem to have lived with his  prominent <a href="jostevenson2244.html">older brother</a> and he was not otherwise accounted for on the Albany <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a>es in <a href="../../census1790.html#2244">1790</a> or 1800.
<p>In September <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/guidedisplay.pl?index=h000101">1801</a>, Alexander Hamilton wrote to him "regarding business matters."

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1802tl">1802</a>, a house and lot on Orange Street under the name of James Stevenson appeared on the city assessment roll.

<p> His nephew and future mayor of Albany, <a href="jastevenson4833.html">James Stevenson</a>, was born in 1788.

<p>Following the latest sweep of <a href="../../res/irs.html">online resources</a> and with important life issues still unresolved, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now from the life of James Stevenson, Jr.</p>
