<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Shepherd</b></a> was born before 1750. He arrived in Albany during the 1770s and was the kinsman of cutler <a href="wmshep1155.html">William Shepherd</a>. In 1779, he was identified as a householder in the first ward. Later, he boarded with William Shepherd also in the first ward.</p>

<p>A number of resources connect "John Shepherd" with the crusade for American liberties. The Albany resident was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html"> bounty right</a> in connection with the First Regiment of the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Militia</a>. In 1781, he was called before the Albany Commissioners on Conspiracies to testify aganst a neighbor accused of exchange violations.</P>

      <p>He was married to Elizabeth and owned several parcels of real estate within 
        the city of Albany including a <a href="../../im/im1800oake.html">large 
        lot</a> on the corner of Hudson and Green Streets.</p>

      <p>In 1781, he was identified as a merchant and was among a group of newcomers 
        empowered to conduct business when he <a href="../../lists/list1781.html">purchased</a> 
        the freedom of the city. At one time, he was the partner of grocer/victualler <a href="../f/jcf8113.html">John C. Fredenrich</a>. In 1790, he was counted in the <a href="../../census1790.html#1155">census</a> under the first ward household of William Shepherd.</p>

<p>John Shepherd's will was written in 1791 while he was in Philadelphia. It identified Elizabeth as his only heir. He died in Albany in March 1797 and was buried in the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a> cemetery plot. He was three months beyond his forty-eighth birthday!</p>

        <B>Sources:</B> The life of John Shepherd is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 2460. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../inprog.html">family</a> 
        and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. Apparently, 
        his marriage was childless. We seek information on his origins and on 
        a possible connection to Philadelphia!</p>
