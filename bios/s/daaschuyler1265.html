<P><a href="#sources"><b>David A. Schuyler</b></a> was born in November 1692. He was the eldest son in the modest family of Albany residents <a href="abschuyler921.html">Abraham D.</a> and <a href="../t/getbroeck46.html">Geertruy Ten Broeck</a> Schuyler. His father was a trader, skipper, and traveller who was absent frequently - perhaps leaving David to help his mother manage their Albany-based  business. Thus, he was thirty-three by the time he started his own family.</p>


<p>David A. Schuyler married mayor's daughter <a href="../h/mahansen4957.html">Maria Hansen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in December 1725. Into his thirties at the time of his marriage, their family was smaller than that of younger parents. Only <a href="abschuyler924.html">one</a> of their children lived to maturity.</p>

<p>Son of a prominent Albany merchant and shipper, David A. Schuyler began as a baker. By the 1720s, he also was being identified as a merchant. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1265">1720</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#1265">1742</a>, his name was included on <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> freeholders' lists.</p> 

<p>Although he did hold property at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> and elsewhere, David A. Schuyler was an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1265">mainstay</a>. In 1718, he was elected an assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> and served for several years. He served on committees and also engaged in business transactions with the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#279">1756</a>, he was identified as a baker when his house was described on a census taken by the British army. With his son <a href="abschuyler924.html">Abraham</a> - a Hudson River skipper, his <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home was included on city assessment rolls in 1766 and '67. As late as <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#1265">1763</a>, his name still was found on Albany freeholders lists. David A. Schuyler was living in December 1767 when he and Maria witnessed a real estate transaction.</p>
