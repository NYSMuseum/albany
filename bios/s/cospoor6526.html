<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Cornelia Spoor</strong></a> was born in April 1712. She was the third daughter of <a href="gespoor6527.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../g/magilbert5156.html">Mary Gilbert</a> Spoor. She grew up in a moderate sized family in the second ward.

<p>In May 1719, she was among the children identified in the <a href="../../wills/willgespoor.html">will</a> filed by her father. Gerrit Spoor died a year later and <a href="../../res/sp.html">Ne</a>eltie's mother is said to then have removed her family to New York City. 

<p>In October 1732, Cornelia married innkeeper's son <a href="../d/rodunbar2268.html">Robert Dunbar</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Six months later, the first of their six children was christened at the Albany church where she was a pewholder.

<p>Perhaps Cornelia's Robert Dunbar was a frontier operative who may have been one of those "<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8BETAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA134&lpg=PA134&dq=%22robert+dunbar%22+albany&source=web&ots=XgC9ycMyem&sig=UGzDq2-F1i0y8brwVnPrA8HNb9Q&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#v=onepage&q=dunbar&f=false">taken at Albany</a>" in February 1746, incarcerated at Montreal, and was the Albany man who escaped  and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8BETAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA137&lpg=PA137&dq=%22robert+dunbar%22+albany&source=web&ots=XgC9ycMyem&sig=UGzDq2-F1i0y8brwVnPrA8HNb9Q&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#v=onepage&q=dunbar&f=false">died</a> that December. In any event, Cornelia's husband no longer appeared in the Albany-based record after the baptism of their last child in September 1744. 

<p>At this point, we believe that widow Cornelia was the woman identified as a third ward householder living with her sons and nearby the house of her brother <a href="jospoor6529.html">Johannes Spoor</a>, on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a> for the mid-1760s. After that, references to Cornelia Spoor Dunbar have not been found in the community-based record.

<p>With outstanding <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> on the her later life and passing, we move on for now!</p>
