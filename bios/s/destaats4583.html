<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Debora Staats</strong></a> was born in May 1752. She was the daughter of Albany natives <a href="gestaats4569.html">Gerrit</a> and <a href="../b/debeekman3885.html">Debora Beekman</a> Staats. She grew up at the family seat on Staats Island across the Hudson and south of Albany. However, her mother died in 1764 when her namesake was entering adolescence.

<p>In November 1778, Debora married newcomer <a href="../g/jograham8219.html">John Graham</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Two daughters were christened there in 1780 and 1786. She was a pewholder there until the Grahams re-located and she became a <a href="http://saratoganygenweb.com/srdcmems.htm">member</a> of the Reformed church of Schuylerville sometime before the end of 1790.


<p>Her husband was an officer in the American army. As newlyweds, these Grahams made their <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#8219">home</a> in the second ward house owned by Debora's uncle, Jochim Staats. In 1790, their third ward <a href="../../census1790.html#8219">household</a> counted four members. After that, the Grahams appear to have left Albany.

<p>In June 1790, she transferred her membership to the church in Schuylerville.
 
<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Debora Staats Graham. Her husband died in 1832 and is said to have been buried on Staats Island.</p>
