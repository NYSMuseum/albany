<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Skidmore</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Sc</a>idmore) probably was born after 1750. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Perhaps he came <a href="http://webspace.webring.com/people/rc/cuzzinkc/gedcoms/d0000/g0000062.html#I605">from</a> Long Island.

<p>In February 1778, "division wagonmaster" John Skidmore was among those took an oath of allegience at Valley Forge. Just afterwards, two John Scidmores joined in a <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/georgeclinton03newy#page/210/mode/2up">petition</a> asking to Governor Clinton to send troops to protect the northern frontier. We have not found him yet in a <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> Albany context.


<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#josk">1788</a>, his house and lot in the first ward was valued on the city assessment roll. At that time, the third ward <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#thsk">holdings</a> of Thomas Skidmore (on roll in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#thsk">1779</a> but in John's later location as well) also were valued.

<p>The first Federal Census for <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> configued the homes of John "Scidmore" in Saratoga and Stillwater. 


<p>His wife was Ann or Nancy Clark. Their daughter was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in January 1795. However, a number of additional marriage senarios have been <a href="../qqqq.html">encountered</a>. 

<p>In 1796, he was identified as a <a href="../../firemasters.html">fireman</a> in Division #1. 

<p>Nancy Skidmore, the wife of John, died in April 1797 and was buried in the Dutch church plot. She had lived thirty-five years.

<p>In November <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, his name appeared on an Albany jury list. He was identified as a carpenter. After that, his name has not yet been found on Albany rolls.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of the Albany John Skidmore. </p>
