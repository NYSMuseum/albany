<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Lancaster Symes</strong></a> was a British army officer and official who arrived in New York in 1690. Based mostly in New York City, he died at Albany in 1729. Probably <a href="../../na/na.html">not an actual resident</a> of the city of Albany, a number of his children are important to the early Albany story.

<p>In November 1694, he married the widow "Catharina Larkens" at the Dutch church in New York. Over the next decade, they witnessed a number of baptisms there.

<p>In 1701, he was made a freeman of New York.

<p>His will dated March 30, 1723 (not located but see <a href="#abs">below</a>) was supplemented by a <a href="">codicil</a> dated March 28, 1727. He was identified as late of New York [and] now of Albany. His wife Catherine was mentioned.

<p>first notice of Lancaster Symes in tins country is that of his arrival at New York, in the ship Beaver, on the 28th of January, 1690-1, as ensign in the company of infantry commanded by his brother-in Richard Ingoldesby, part of the escort sent with Colonel Henry Sloughter when commissioned Governor of New York. His first public act was the demand made by him, in company with Counsellor Brooke and Lieutenant 
Shanks, for the surrender to Ingoldesby of the fort at New York for occu- 
pation by the forces under his command. Leisler's indignant and ai 
refusal to acquiesce in this demand was the commencement of the sad 
troubles which shortly followed. 

      <p>A few months after these occurrences, and when Governor Sloughter had become 
        securely fixed in his office (May 7, 1691), he writes thus of Ensign es 
        to the Committee of Foreign Plantations : " Lieutenant Wildbore is dead. 
        I have commissioned one Lancaster Sinims in his stead. He is one that 
        came from England with us — a good soldier, and diligent in busi- ness 
        ; therefore, pray he may be allowed." On the same day, writing to the 
        Duke of Bolton, he adds: " Major Englesby and myself humbly beg grace's 
        favor that Lancaster Simms may be confirmed lieutenant in- stead of Lieftennant 
        Wildboare, who dyed at sea. Simms came over with the Major; he is a soldier, 
        and qualified in every respect." 
      <p>In the early part of the year 1692-3, he was stationed at Albany, whence 
he was detached with a supply of provisions for a party commanded by 
•)• Schuyler, who was then in pursuit of the French on their retreat 
after having invaded the Mohawk country. Returning to -New York, 
Lieutenant Symes was sent in May to Suffolk Co. to bring up the quota 
of that district ordered to Albany; but he returned and reported, on the 
20th of that month, that his mission was unsuccessful. 

<p>His connection with the administrations of Sloughter and his successors 
•red him cut of favor with the Leislerian party, who came into power 
on the advent of the Earl of Bellomont; and this nobleman, on 22d De- 
cember;- 1698, suspended Symes as lieutenant of Major Ingoldesby's com- 
of fusileerSj ostensibly because he had been two years absent from 
his post at Albany, adding in his letter announcing the suspension: "He 
applied to me to be restored, and deserves for many reasons to be broke, which I hope the king will be pleased to consent to." In revenj 
Symes appears as one of the signers of the petition to the king, denouncing 
the administrations of Bellomont and Nanfan, in which he and others com- 
plained that they had been unjustly turned out of employment under the 
Government. Trinity Church at this, time was anti-Leisler also, and so 
elected Mr. Symes, after his suspension, one of their vestrymen, which office 
he filled until 1704, and again in 1705. 

<p>He appears to have been a man of hasty temper, for we find a complaint 
lodged against him in April, 1699, for a violent assault he and some of his 
friends committed on one John Marsh in King's Co., whom they also 
arrested, and, as it is alleged, falsely imprisoned. The matter was referred 
to the House of Assembly by the Earl of Bellomont, to whom the House 
presented an address on the 15th of May on the subject. 

<p>Upon ceasing to be connected with the military, Lieutenant Symes em- 
barked in trade, and turned his attention to acquiring a share in those 
lar^ r e tracts of land which were being Javishly distributed at that day. In 
the forepart of 1 701-2 he, with Robert Walters, Cornelius De Peyster, 
Caleb Heathcote, Mathew Clarkson, and others, obtained a grant of up- 
wards of 5,000 acres of land in Westchester Co., subsequently known 
as the West Patent of North Castle. In 1703 he became one of the grantees 
in the Minisinck Patent, Orange Co. In 1707 he secured a grant of 
land in the town of Monroe, Orange Co.; in 170S in Clarkstown, near 
Haverstraw, Rockland Co.; on the 27th October, 170S. all the unpatented 
lands on Staten Island; and, in 1709, one-eighth of 6.500 acres in 
Orange and Ulster Counties likewise fell to his share. In addition to 
these, he owned a house and lot in Dock (now Pearl) Street, New York, 
and he also held, by lease, the mansion and grounds at Whitehall, formerly 
the residence of Governor Dongan, and also the grounds called the Vine- 
yard, eastward of the present City Hall Park, which had been previ* 
mortgaged to him by the Governor to secure a debt of ^'200 that he, 
Governor Dongan, owed to James Larkin, the former husband of Mrs. 
Symes. 
<p>On 15th May, 1704, he was appointed Public Appraiser for the city, and on the 2 2d May of the following year, obtained a contract to furnish wood to the garrison in Fort Anne. He was commissioned Ranger of Orange Co., 19th September, 1719, and finally restored to his rank as lieutenant of one of the independent companies stationed in New York, 
commanded by Captain Weems. This officer dying. Governor Burnet, on 
13th May, 1723, bestowed the vacant command of the company of fusi- 
leers on Symes, who immediately embarked for England in order to 
his appointment confirmed. In November following he returned with his 
commission to New York, where he continued to reside, having young George 
Ingoldesby, his nephew, as his lieutenant. He represented the county of 
Orange in the Assembly from 27th September, 1726, to the time of his 
death, which took place in the latter end of March or beginning of April, I 7 2 9- 

<p>Captain Symes' wife was Catharine, widow of James Larkin, and dan. of Matthias De Haart, whom he m. Nov. 4, 1694, she being then in her twenty-second year. Her mother was Jannetje, or Johanna, 
widow at the time of her marriage with De Haart (Oct. 1, 1670) of Johannes De Witt, and by the latter, her first husband, ancestress of the distinguished family of that name. 



<p>Captain Symes left four children, viz. : 
<br>1. Jchn Hendrick., 
<br>2. Lancaster. 
<br>3. Richard. 
<br>4. Elizabeth. 

<p>He left also one grandchild, Richard Green, son of his deceased dau., Catharine, wife of Green.
