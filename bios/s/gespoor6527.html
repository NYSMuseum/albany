He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers John and Ann Marie Hanse Spoor. This elder son is <a href="../../res/ts.html">said</a> to have grown up in large family on his father's farm in <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Canistigone</a>.

<p>In July 1706, Gerrit married <a href="../g/magilbert5156.html">Maria Gilbert</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as born and living in Albany and as single people. The marriage appears to have produced at least five children who were christened in Albany where the parents were occasional baptism sponsors.

<p>These Spoors raised their family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where Gerrit's holdings were <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6527">assessed</a> moderately.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, he was identified as a member of Gerrit Roseboom's company of Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>Gerrit Spoor filed a <a href="../../wills/willgespoor.html">will</a> in May 1719. It identified real and personal property. He was dead by June 1720 when the will passed probate. His widow survived and some of their children became Albany residents.</p>
