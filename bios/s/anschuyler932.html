<P><A  href="#biography"><B>Anna Schuyler</B></A> was born in 1697. She was the only child of Albany natives <a href="mynschuyler101.html">Myndert</a> and <a href="../c/racuyler605.html">Rachel Cuyler</a> Schuyler</P>

<P>Anna was three months shy of her nineteenth birthday when she married newcomer <a href="../d/jodp.html">Johannes De Peyster</a> in 1715. The new couple moved into the State Street <a href="#home">home</a> of John's <a href="../b/ebancker6454.html">uncle</a> and resided there for the rest of their lives. After several early deaths, Anna's four later children were born there between 1723 and 1739.</P>

<p>Anna lived the life of the wife of a <a href="../../cityfathers.html">civic leader</a>. She stood up as godmother at several family baptisms and was named co-executor of her father's estate in 1739. Her last child was born that year when she was forty-two years old.</P>

          <p>Anna Schuyler De Peyster died in September 1750 at age fifty-three. She was 
            buried under the Albany Dutch church. Her <a href="../d/jodp.html">husband</a> 
            survived her by more than forty years.</p>
