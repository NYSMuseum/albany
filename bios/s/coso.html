<P>Spelled <a href="../../res/sp.html">and</a> referred to variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Conrad Soop</strong></a> may have been <a href="../../res/guess.html">born</a> in New York City in May 1752. His family was a part of the <a href="http://www.olivetreegenealogy.com/palatines/palatine-history.shtml">Palatine</a> German migration to New York decades earlier.

<p>Upon reaching adulthood, he relocated to what was then the <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> district of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and lived there for the remainder of his long life. He was <a href="../../na/na.html">not</a> a resident of the city of Albany and meets <a href="#none">none</a> of the <a href="../../criteria.html">criteria</a> for inclusion among the people of colonial Albany.

<p>He appears to have been a member of a southern Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> regiment. Beginning in 1776, he was in active service each year from 1776 to 1780. He detailed his record to claim a service pension in 1833. His name has not been found on post-war land bounty lists but a "Conradt Sooley" was among the enlisted men on a regiment of New York State Levies commanded by Col. Frederick Weissenfels. In 1836, he testified on behalf of fellow pensioner David Flensburgh - his neighbor. The following year, he made a similar declaration on behalf of Isaac Van Wie. 

<p>He appears to have <a href="http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/amasa-j-amasa-junius-parker/landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek/page-129-landmarks-of-albany-county-new-york-rek.shtml">marr</a>ied Elizabeth Becker of Schoharie in 1774. The marriage produced a number of children. However, their christenings were not recorded at the Albany  <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.
