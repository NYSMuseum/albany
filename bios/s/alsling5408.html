<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Albert Slingerland</strong></a> probably was born during the 1660s. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New</a> Netherland pioneers <a href="tesling5439.html">Teunis</a> and <a href="../b/enbradt4185.html">Engeltie Bradt</a> Slingerland. He grew up on the family farm in today's <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> and also in Albany where his father owned a house.
 
<p>Perhaps in June 1695, he <a href="https://dcms.lds.org/delivery/DeliveryManagerServlet?dps_pid=IE937775">married</a> one "Hester Brikkers" ( <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Becker) in the Reformed church at Hackensack, New Jersey. At that time, both partners were <a href="http://trees.wmgs.org/getperson.php?personID=I96587&tree=Schirado">said</a> to have been from Albany.  By 1704, five children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>In <a href="../../census1697.html#159">1697</a>, his Albany home was configured on the county census. At that time, his household consisted of a man, a woman, and one child. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">1702</a>, his first ward house was valued on the Albany assessment roll.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=69kTAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA211&lpg=PA211&dq=%22brewer&source=bl&ots=Iqbfe8_nTN&sig=oFDPXH8fkYdMqFQWUiPwpIBcTBs&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KRhHU-uRD8WcyQHWj4G4CQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22brewer%2C%20richard%22%20albany&f=false">October 1706</a>, he was paid by the provincial Council for boarding Lt. <a href="../b/ribrewer7414.html">Richard Brewer</a> in his Albany house. In <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/The-Annals-of-Albany-Volume-5/652642/179">August 1707</a>, he was among those who testified in and Albany death inquest. After that, his name has not been found in the community-based record. 

<p>In January 1713, he was <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/Calendar-of-Wills-on-File-and-Recorded-in-the-Offices-of-the-Clerk-of-the-Court-of-Appeals-of-the-County-Clerk-at-Albany/773718/407">named</a> as the brother and co-executor of the estate of Arent Slingerland of the Colony. In 1715, his name appeared on the roster of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. However, he does not appear to have held municipal offices.
 
<p>In July 1725, he is said to have filed a <a href="#will">will</a>. It named his wife and several living children. Albert Slingerland was dead by July 1731 when the will passed probate.
