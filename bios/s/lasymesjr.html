<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Lancaster Symes. Jr. </strong></a> probably was born in New York within a few years of 1700. He was named for a British provincial <a href="lasymes.html">officer</a> (his father) who died in Albany in 1729. His mother <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2001-05/0990998571">may have been</a> the widow Catherine De Hart Larkins who married Lancaster Symes in 1694. We seek defining information on this subject's birth.

<p>At this point, we are experiencing difficulty differentiating the public careers of the Lancaster Symeses in eighteenth century New York. (Military officer? landholder? officer at St. Peter's in <a href="../../stpeters.html">Albany</a> in 1725) His father is said to have died in 1729.
 

<p>In January 1729, this Anglo American married Albany native and minister's daughter <a href="../l/mgtlydius.html">Margarita Lydius</a> at the Albany <a href"../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. His son and namesake was christened in Albany that November. The marriage also produced two surviving daughters who married prominent provincial personages.


<p>Stating that he was a "gentleman" of New York, Lancaster Symes filed a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dlMOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA174&lpg=PA174&dq=%22lancaster+symes%22&source=web&ots=roCNVCOjIN&sig=YF2sDMX93dIyYtFZq_fhn9v-PtQ#v=onepage&q=%22lancaster%20symes%22&f=false">will</a> in March 1741. His wife was not named but he devised his estate to his three living children - reserving a nominal bequest for his eldest (only) son Lancaster. <a href="../r/jaroseboom1665.html">Dr. Jacob Roseboom</a> of Albany (husband of his wife's sister) was named co-executor and his son <a href="../r/joroseboom1928.html">John Roseboom</a> was named contingent beneficiary along with the children of his wife's brother John Henry Lydius.


<p>Widower of an Albany native, Lancaster Symes. Jr. is said to have died in 1756. </p>
