      <P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, <a href="#sources"> 
        <strong>Sara Schepmoes</strong></a> was christened in New Amsterdam in 
        April 1654. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> 
        pioneers Johannes and Sara Pieters <a href="http://schepmoes.blogspot.com/">Schepmoes</a>. 
        Her father died shortly after her birth and her mother remarried. Perhaps 
        the youngest of her mother's children, she seems to have grown up in New 
        York City where she was among the siblings granted <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bRKt8SfPVbYC&pg=PA161&lpg=PA161&dq=%22Sarah,+wife+of+Johanes+De+Wandeloer%22&source=bl&ots=cUgXT2MFa-&sig=FrS2R4z8O46d-tWlSlcg55-OtuE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0lOWuws3XAhWGPiYKHb-7D7QQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=%22Sarah%2C%20wife%20of%20Johanes%20De%20Wandeloer%22&f=false">letters</a> 
        of administration on her late father's estate about 1690. 
      <p>In March 1672, young Sara married <a href="../d/jodewan6162.html">Johannes 
        De Wandelaer</a> in the <a href="../../drc.html">D</a>utch church of New 
        York. By 1695, the marriage had produced nine children who were christened 
        in the Dutch churches on Manhattan and later in <a href="../../drc.html">Albany</a> 
        where they both were members and baptism sponsors. However, after 1700, 
        more than one same-named woman is at-risk in the church records. 
      <p>By <a href="../../census1679.html#6162">1679</a>, these De Wandelaers 
        had settled in Albany where Johannes found success in the fur trade. Perhaps 
        they had followed her <a href="anschepmoes8629.html">sister</a> who had 
        moved to Albany following her marriage a decade earlier. After about twenty 
        years on upper <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> in 
        Albany, Johannes and Sara seem to have resided more in New York where 
        he also owned a house. 
      <p>Unlike her eight living children, Sara Schepmoes De Wandelaer was not 
        named in the <a href="../../wills/willjodwand.html">will</a> filed by 
        her husband in June 1705.</p>
