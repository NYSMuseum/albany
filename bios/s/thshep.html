<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas Shephard</strong></a> was born about 1776. He probably was the Albany-born son of resident newcomers <a href="wmshep1155.html">William</a> and Jane Shephard. He grew up with many siblings in the upper State Street <a href="../../census1790.html#1155">home</a> of an Albany cutler whose <a href="../../friends.html">heart</a> belonged to the British but who managed to remain in Albany after the end of the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>.

<p>In September 1791, Thomas was confirmed in <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Episcopal church where his father was a member and vestryman.

<p>In September 1792, his bill for a painting and also for a landscape were included in the accounts of artist <a href="../a/ea.html">Ezra Ames</a>.

<p>In March 1794, he was among the six living sons listed in the <a href="../../wills/willwmshep1155.html">will</a> filed by his father. William Shephard was dead by the end of the year.

<p>Thomas Shephard's wife was named Phebe. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and on the births of their children. Their daughter (b. 1801) married a "Gerrit Van Zandt Bleecker." She <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/Jane_Shepard_records.ashx?pid=21315494">named</a> a child for her father in 1833.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#thsh">1800</a>, his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household included only the young couple and their young daughter. A decade later, Thomas Shephard's <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">resident family</a> totalled ten members. 

<p>Unless he was in business with <a href="../f/jcf8113.html">John C. Fredenreich</a> in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> when their personal property in the first ward was valued substantially, his name does not appear on that assessment roll. At this point, we have only <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> regarding his occupation. However, he was a member of the 
<a href="../../ams.html#members">Albany Mechanics Society</a>. 

<p>Thomas Shephard died in June 1814 (probably 1813 instead) and was buried in the <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> plot. He had lived only 38 years. A <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> for "Thomas Shepherd" appears to have passed probate in Albany in January 1813. In that year, his widow was listed in the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA86&lpg=PA86&dq=%22widow+of+thomas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22widow%20of%20thomas%22&f=false">first city directory</a> at 50 Washington (soon to be re-named <a href="../../streets.html#southpearl">South Pearl</a>) Street.

<p>With basic, unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> and so many <a href="../../res/sp.html">variable</a> references, we move on for now!
