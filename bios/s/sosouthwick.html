      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Solomon Southwick</strong></a> was born 
        in Newport, Rhode Island in December 1773. He was the son and <a href="http://www.archives.upenn.edu/people/1700s/southwick_sol.html">namesake</a> 
        of the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA105,M1">publisher</a> 
        of the <i>Newport Mercury</i> which became a champion of the American 
        cause. His mother was the widow Ann Gardner Carpenter. He was at least 
        the fourth generation of his family to be christened "Solomon." His family 
        was forced from their landmark Newport home by the British but soon returned 
        and his father was granted a master's degree by Yale in 1780. 
      <p>As his father died in poverty, Solomon grew up <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=%22southwick,+solomon%22+editor&source=bl&ots=2hLtKZXz3A&sig=9NTru5Wrei0KFns50SW-7HNQkNY&hl=en&ei=Mw4cSpuJFo3KM46L0JoP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#PPA104,M1">"</a>a 
        destitute orphan, without friends, without resources of any kind, other 
        than such as nature had bestowed upon him in the inappreciable blessings 
        of a sound and vigorous constitution — he commenced the work of self-education 
        in the stern school of adversity, and progressed step by step with an 
        unfaltering determination and an unyielding energy.<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=%22southwick,+solomon%22+editor&source=bl&ots=2hLtKZXz3A&sig=9NTru5Wrei0KFns50SW-7HNQkNY&hl=en&ei=Mw4cSpuJFo3KM46L0JoP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6#PPA104,M1">"</a> 
      <p>Destined to be a cook for a Cape Cod fishery, young Solomon instead became 
        a coastal sailor. At age eighteen, he had left the sea to become an apprentice 
        printer in New York City. In 1792, he migrated to Albany as a journeyman 
        landing in the office of the <a href="../../org/ar.html"><i>Albany Register</i></a> 
        - published by his brothers-in-law <a href="../b/robarber.html">Robert</a> 
        then <a href="../b/jobarber7202.html">John Barber</a>. His slightly older 
        brother, Henry C. Southwick (1772-1821), also settled in Albany and was 
        a printer as well. 
      <p>In 1792, he became a partner in <i>The Register</i> following the exit 
        of its founder, Robert Barber. 
      <p>In March 1795, he married Jane Barber of Albany. By 1815, the marriage 
        had produced nine children. After <a href="../../census1800.html#7202">living 
        first</a> with the Barbers, by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">1810</a> 
        his household began to be configured on the Albany census in 1810 
      <p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA88&lpg=PA88&dq=%22southwick,+solomon%22+editor&source=bl&ots=2hLtKZXz3A&sig=9NTru5Wrei0KFns50SW-7HNQkNY&hl=en&ei=Mw4cSpuJFo3KM46L0JoP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6">1813</a>, 
        he was identified in the <a href="../../sources.html#ad"><i>City Directory</i></a> 
        as the editor of the Albany Register at 20 South Pearl Street and then 
        in the rear of the Wendell house at 94 <a href="../../map/bogertmap.html">State</a>. 
      <p>In 1801, he was a member of an Albany fire company. 
      <p>From 1803 to 1806, he was clerk of the New York State <a href="../../org/ass.html">A</a>ssembly. 
        Briefly in 1808, he served as clerk of the Senate. He then was appointed 
        <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County and served 
        until 1810. 
      <p>In 1809, he was named State printer. 
      <p>In 1812, he was named to the New York State Board of Regents. 
      <p>Although apparently without formal training, at age forty he was admitted 
        to practice <a href="../../trades/law.html">law</a> in several courts 
        based in Albany. 
      <p>For a time, he was the <a href="../../org/po.html">postmaster</a> at 
        Albany. He was removed from the office in 1822. 
      <p>He ran for a number of offices including congress and the governorship 
        but seems to have been unsuccessful. 
      <p>Dating from the 1790s, he was an advocate for the establishment of a 
        number of libraries in Albany and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=tBUIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22solomon+southwick%22+regents&source=bl&ots=r9W2yaEJ85&sig=OxecUM7la018aV5BIkMlOvUp9VM&hl=en&ei=Ck4dStujBorSMOKEyaAP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#PPA53,M1">beyond</a>. 
      <p>He was an officer of at least one Albany bank. 
      <p>After the <i>Register</i> ceased operations in 1820, he published a number 
        of specialty newspapers. In 1826, he retired from the press and opened 
        a lottery office. 
      <p>Although his various presses had printed a number of <a href="../../org/masonic.html">M</a>asonic 
        works, by <a href="http://bessel.org/bkrevs.htm">1827</a> he was writing 
        and publishing <i>A Solemn Warning Against Freemasonry</i>. In 1828, he 
        was selected to be a delegate to the State Antimasonic convention at a 
        meeting held at the house of <a href="dashields.html">Daniel Shields</a>. 
        He was the party's candidate for governor in that year and received twelve 
        percent of the vote. His political exploits at that time have been graphically 
        <a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/state/his/bk12/ch6/pt1.html">described</a> 
        by James Sulllivan in his <i>History of New York State</i>. 
      <p>Solomon Southwick died <a href="http://www.famousamericans.net/solomonsouthwick/">un</a>expectedly 
        in November 1839 and was buried in the Episcopal burial ground. He had 
        lived almost sixty-six years. He was <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ne_albany_bio2.htm">said</a> 
        to have been "a remarkable man; with strong convictions, great boldness, 
        untiring devotion, and great ambition. During his later years, he devoted 
        his high powers to doing good." His widow is <a href="http://records.ancestry.com/Jane%20Barber_records.ashx?pid=2121593">said</a> 
        to have survived until 1861.</p>

        <p>Excerpt from <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ne_albany_bio2.htm"><i>New 
          England in Albany</i></a> by Jonathan Tenney: 
        <dd><b> Solomon SOUTHWICK, </b> b. Newport, R.I., Dec. 25, 1773; d. Albany, 
          Nov. 18, 1839. Came to this city, 1792; became connected with the <i>Albany 
          Register</i>, published by Robert Barber, whose sister he married; and 
          succeeded him as proprietor in 1808. It was the leading paper of his 
          party, and he the leader until 1817. He held offices of State printer, 
          Clerk of the Assembly, Sheriff of the County, president of Mechanics' 
          and Farmers' Bank, postmaster and regent of the University. Twice he 
          was the candidate for Governor; when 40 years of age, he was admitted 
          as attorney at law. Besides the <i>Register</i>, he conducted the <i>"Ploughboy," 
          "National Observer," "Christian Visitant" </i> and <i>"Family Newspaper."</i> 
          He lectured extensively on temperance, education and morality, and published 
          valuable treatises on these and kindred subjects. He was a remarkable 
          man; with strong convictions, great boldness, untiring devotion, and 
          great ambition. During his later years, he devoted his high powers to 
          doing good.
