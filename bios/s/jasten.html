<P>Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>James Stenhouse</strong></a> <a href="../../res/sp.html">or</a> Jacob Stanhouse probably was born during the early 1700s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. The name Stenhouse/Stanhouse appears to have been of <a href="../irish.html">Scot</a>tish origin.

<p>In September <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA61&lpg=PA61&dq=%22annals+of+albany%22+volume+9&source=web&ots=ssp_5u99Tk&sig=7txB-4aXAwwqP7hu6OIE7Us-oqU#v=onepage&q=stenhouse&f=false">1731</a>, he was paid 16 shillings by the Albany government for "some particular writings." That entry marked the beginning of his time as "a" clerk for the <a href="../../corporation.html">city council</a>. The following April, he was paid for "entering minutes relating to a water <a href="../../fire.html#engine">engine</a>" and for writing a letter. 

<p>In September 1732, he married <a href="../v/anvedder.html">Anna Margarita Vedder</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1748, five children had been christened in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1735">1735</a>, he was appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#jast">1742</a>, James Stenhouse was listed among the freeholders in the second ward.

<p>In May 1746, he witnessed the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=OJf5CdoAkrkC&pg=PA96&lpg=PA96&dq=%22james+stenhouse%22+cloet&source=bl&ots=4RNnZCiO1P&sig=Zstjs60ft9op514Oi1sBo2PCNZo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vWWwUrD2NtS0sQSs7IHwDw&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22james%20stenhouse%22%20cloet&f=false">will</a> of a Cohoes yeoman.

      <p>The name of Jacob/James Stenhouse last appeared in the community-based record 
        in 1748. With unanswered <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a>, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move 
        on</a> for now.</p>

That <a href="../../res/ts.html">source</a> observes that "Stanhouse" and two sons were selling "gensing roots" during the eighteenth century. Perhaps his sons had subsequent <a href="../../sources.html#jp">business</a> with <a href="../j/swj.html">William Johnson</a>.
