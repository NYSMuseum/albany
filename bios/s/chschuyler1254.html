<strong>Christina Schuyler</strong></a> was born in December 1752. She was the last child born to the marriage of Albany natives <a href="jaschuyler1327.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="gestaats4585.html">Geertruy Staats</a> Schuyler. Her father died in 1760. However, her forty-nine-year-old mother did not remarry. Possibly, the widow lived for some time and raised her family in the <a href="../../census1756.html#278">homes</a> of relatives.

<p>In September 1772, Christina was not yet twenty when she married <a href="../vkl/javloon6706.html">Jacob Van Loon</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1798, eleven children had been christened in Albany. However, only a few of them survived to adulthood.

<p>These Van Loons <a href="../../census1790.html#6706">raised</a> their family in the second ward where Jacobus Van Loon kept a tavern in the rear of his business on <a href="../../streets.html#lion">Lion Street</a> - above the settled part of the city.

<p>Christina Schuyler Van Loon died in Ocober 1798 - a few weeks following the birth of her last child. She had lived less than forty-six years. Her husband survived until the 1820s.
