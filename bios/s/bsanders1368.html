<P><A href="#biography"><B>Barent Sanders</B></A> was born in May 1678. He was the son of <a href="../irish.html">Scottish</a>-ancestry entrepreneur <a href="rosanders.html">Robert Sanders</a> and his European-born wife, <a href="../vkl/elvkleeck1048.html">Elizabeth Barents Van Kleeck</a>. These pioneers had settled in <a href="../../earlycity.html">Albany</a> where young Barent joined his father in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> and in developing Robert's growing real estate holdings.</P>

          <P>Barent was past his twenty-sixth birthday when he married young <a href="../w/mawendell3044.html">Maria 
            Wendell</a> in September 1704. Their <a href="../../children.html">small 
            family</a> of three children was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a> where both parents were members and frequent baptism sponsors.</P>

 <p>Unlike his multi-dimensional father, Barent Sanders  seems to have spent most of his adult 
            life in Albany. From a home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl 
            Street</a>, he established an <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#1368">identity</a> 
            as a merchant and landholder while serving the community in the <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html#1368">militia</a>, 
            and as constable, firemaster, assistant, and alderman for the second 
            ward. During the 1720s, he was active as an <a href="../../cia.html">Indian 
            commissioner</a>. Sanders also collected fees from survey and contract 
            work. Left substantial <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>, he was able to manage additional 
            family property in Albany, Schenectady, and in Dutchess County - and 
            to add to those holdings as well.</p>

          <p>Following the death of his <a href="../w/mawendell3044.html">wife</a>, 
            this well-known Albany merchant filed a <a href="../../wills/willbsanders1368.html">will</a> 
            in November 1739. He deposed that he was of perfect sound mind" and 
            left extensive real estate to his sons. Barent Sanders died in Albany 
            in November 1757. He lived to see his son, <a href="rosanders1443.html">Robert 
            Sanders</a>, appointed mayor of Albany.</p>
