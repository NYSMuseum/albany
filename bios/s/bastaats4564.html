<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Barent I. Staats</strong></a> was born in June 1739. He was the son of <a href="isstaats4592.html">Isaac</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdu5554.html">Maria Van Deusen</a> Staats. He grew up in the first ward home of a <a href="../../census1756.html#86">prominent</a> cooper. He was known as "Barent Isaac Staats."  His three brothers also became Albany residents.

<p>In 1767, he was identified as a private in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>
.
<p>During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his name appeared beneath that of his father on city tax lists. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#4564">1779</a>, his personal property was valued under the house of his widowed mother. 

<p>In January 1760, he married the much older Albany "spinster" <a href="../w/elwendell2858.html">Elizabeth Wendell</a> at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> Anglican church. No children were christened at Albany churches although both he and his wife were pewholders at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. A surviving daughter was noted in 1782.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1762">1762</a> and again in 1767, he was appointed firemaster for the first ward. During the war years, he also was named inspector of bread and chimney viewer.  

<p>In his mid-thirties at the outbreak of hostilities in 1775, he served the American cause as an officer in the Albany County militia. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel of the <a href="http://www.fortklock.com/nymilitiaalbany3.htm">third</a> and also eighth regiment. On a number of occasions, he commanded soldiers who performed services for the Albany <a href="../../cddc.html">commissioners</a>. He also served as a bailsman and was referred to as "Esq."  Afterwards, he may have been the Barent Staats who was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. As late as 1794, Barent I. Staats was still <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=uZPMs7jGhDgC&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22barent+i+staats%22&source=bl&ots=5l1mH0QNPp&sig=Frp1ZStGGpNbWwyjPnISHU7FAMw&hl=en&ei=4jsWTI6tM8GAlAemwozzDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22barent%20i%20staats%22&f=false">seeking</a> compensation for wartime expenses. He also held bounty <a href="http://www.fortbrewerton.org/oliver.htm">lands</a> in central New York
 
<p>After the war, his name seems to have been left off city rolls as he had taken up residence just beyond the <a href="../../citylimits.html">city limits</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4564">1790</a>, his houshold was configured on the <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> census.

<p>He was a resident of Rensselaerswyck when he filed a <a href="../../wills/willbastaats4564.html">will</a> in February 1782. It named his wife and daughter Molly as heirs. Elizabeth and her prominent <a href="../w/abewendell2739.html">brothers</a> were named executors. Barent I. Staats was fifty-five when died in September 1794. He was buried from the Dutch church. The will passed probate in March 1795.</p>
