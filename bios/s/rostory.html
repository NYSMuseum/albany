<P><a href="#sources"><b>Robert Story</b></a> was a Manhattan businessman trying to conduct business in Albany during the last quarter of the seventeenth century.

<p>Family-based resources <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Robert-Story/6000000000189817286">note</a> that he was born in London <a href="../../res/guess.html">in</a> 1617 By the 1670s, he was married to one Patience Lloyd/Gardiner <a href="../qqqq.html">and/or</a> Wilson with whom he had at least five children. He is said to have been the son and father of Robert Story. We seek defining information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to America and Albany. Perhaps part of that story was set in <a href="http://www.ronulrich.com/rfuged/fam18258.htm">Pennsylvania</a>.</p>


<p>He purchased a house in Albany in 1676. He was a <a href="../../sources.html#cma">frequent litigant</a> before the Albany court. He also found himself <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA140&lpg=PA140&dq=%22robert+story%22+albany&source=bl&ots=zDhYs1UDmK&sig=nIgmI61bhHrxFsSzaadxDDjvqOU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CgM5VaH1DoeJsQTvkoCYBQ&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20story%22%20albany&f=false">indebted</a> to Albany creditors. In <a href="../../census1679.html#128">1679</a>, his Albany house was given one of the highest assessments! In <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nkHQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=%22robert+story%22&source=bl&ots=-jAWt5T1CY&sig=uB1vvyk_ejWByPdTOn4hlW2tlyE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=CgM5VaH1DoeJsQTvkoCYBQ&ved=0CDoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20story%22&f=false">October 1679</a>, he sold that house to <a href="../l/geglansing3698.html">Gerrit Lansing</a>. Five years later his Albany taxes were still <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">in arrears</a>.</p>

<p>During his time in Albany, Story is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rip_Van_Dam">said</a> to have employed young native son <a href="../vd/rvd6353.html">Rip Van Dam</a> - who perhaps followed him back to Manhattan and later became acting governor of the province.

<p>In August 1681, an early <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=irQLR5e4ljcC&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=%22robert+story%22+new+york&source=bl&ots=7RDtnEqnxV&sig=VoSxGQYmy2-QMmL7BFKwDXnrvj8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tt04VerTKuffsATWtoCgBg&ved=0CDUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20story%22%20new%20york&f=false">meeting</a> of Friends (Quakers) was held at his New York house.

<p>Robert Story died in New York in December 1683. An <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~blkyn/Civil/NYCWills.1665.html">inventory</a> of his extensive estate included wampum and skins but no Albany property. His wife, Patience, was made <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=aVUOAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=%22robert+story%22+new+york&source=bl&ots=22md96porY&sig=Z6fGEa2gUQii6nUxpshe36pN60o&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tt04VerTKuffsATWtoCgBg&ved=0CCUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22robert%20story%22%20new%20york&f=false">executor</a>. One-time Albany cohort <a href="../w/sawilson6907.html">Samuel Wilson</a> was among the witnesses. Piatience remarried in 1684. Their children, Enoch and Mercy, also were named.</p>
