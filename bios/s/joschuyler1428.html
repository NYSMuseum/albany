          <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Johannes Schuyler, Jr. </B></A> was born 
            in Albany in October 1697, the third child of businessman <a href="joschuyler100.html">Johannes</a> 
            and the widow <a href="elsstaats99.html">Elsie Staats Wendell</a> 
            Schuyler. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/joschuyler1428250.jpg" width=250 align=right border=1 alt="Johannes Schuyler, Jr." vspace=4 hspace=4></a> 
            He grew up in the Schuyler <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">family 
            home</a> with a dozen siblings from his mother's <a href="../w/jowendell2942.html">first</a> 
            and second marriages.</P>

          <P>Johannes Jr. married <a href="../vc/covcortlandt6662.html">Cornelia Van Cortlandt</a> 
            at the New York City Dutch church in 1723. The marriage brought a 
            large dowry and substantial inheritance from one of the wealthiest 
            families in the province. Cornelia and Johannes had ten children. 
            All of their births were inscribed in his bible that survives in the 
            collection of the Schuyler Mansion State Historic Site.</P>

<p>He followed his father into frontier and farm business and to lucrative government contracts. He even added acreage to his family's already extensive holdings. During the 1730s, he was appointed to the Albany <a href="../../cia.html">Commissioners of Indian Affairs</a>.</p> 
          In 1739, his father deeded him the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">family 
          farm</a> at the Flats. By the time he turned forty, Johannes had emerged 
          as the most likely man to lead the Albany Schuyler family. He was elected 
          first ward <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> in 1738 and 
          1739. The governor of New York appointed him <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a> 
          of Albany in September 1740. He was re-nominated in 1741 but did not 
          take the oath of allegiance required of officeholders.

          <p>Johannes Schuyler, Jr. had become ill. Stating he was sick, Johannes filed 
            his <a href="../../wills/willjoschuyler1428.html">will</a> in October 1741. It left the entire estate to Cornelia - including the property she had inherited from her father, as long 
            as she remained a widow. She was charged with the education of their 
            children. After her death, the estate would be divided among their 
            five living children. He died on November 5, 1741 at age forty-four. 
            He was buried in the family plot at <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Schuyler 
            Flats</a>.</p>
