<P><a href="#sources"><b>Jochem Staats</b></a> was born in September 1717. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="bastaats136.html">Barent</a> and <a href="../vd/covdb5749.html">Neeltie Vandenbergh</a> Staats.  .</p>


<p>In May 1739, he married a slightly older <a href="elschuyler1272.html">Elizabeth Schuyler</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1760, nine of their children were baptized in Albany where both parents were members and longtime pewholders.</p>

<p>These Staatses lived on his family's property on Staats Island. In 1748, he was identified as the eldest son and named co-executor of his father's estate. His father's <a href="../../wills/willbastaats.html">will</a> instructed him to share the property with his brother, <a href="gestaats4569.html">Gerrit</a>, and to help provide for his mother. He also was co-executor of his brother-in-law's <a href="../../wills/willjovisscher4142.html">estate</a>.</p>



<p>For more than a half century, Jochem Staats was a prominent resident of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. His name appeared on assessment rolls, voter (freeholder) lists, and on the census of <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a> in Rensselaerswyck where his home was attended by eight slaves.</p>

<p>During the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War for Independence</a>, he served as member of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Correspondence</a> for Rensselaerswyck. After the war, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Fourth Regiment of the Albany militia.</p>

<p>He may have lived until 1804!</p>
