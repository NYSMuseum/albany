<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Thomas W. Stanton</strong></a> was born after 1755. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#stanton">1790</a>, five Stanton-named households were configured on the census for the southern part of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> but no Stanton homes were listed <a href="../../citylimits.html">within</a> the city of Albany. 

<p>But less than a decade later, "Thomas W. Stanton was living in the city. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and personal property on the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> were valued modestly.
<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#tws">1800</a>, the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> census listed his household with a young man and woman as residents. A decade <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">later</a>, four children, two younger women, and another <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free person</a> had joined the couple's family.
<p>The first roster of the <a href="../../ams.html#members">Albany Mechanics Society</a> identified him as a member and a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">cordwainer</a>.

<p>Beginning in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=%22stanton+thomas%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22stanton%20thomas%22&f=false">1813</a>, the <a href"../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> identified him as a shoemaker at 97 <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver Street</a>. However, after 1814, his name no longer appeared in the community-based record.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the marriage (he <a href="../../res/guess.html">appears</a> to have raised children), later life, and <a  href="../../res/death.html">passing</a> of one-time Albany resident Thomas W. Stanton </p>
