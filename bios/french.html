<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>French</strong></a> <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=french">speakers</a> and/or those of "French" ancestry were present in Albany and its <a href="../beverwyck.html">pre</a>decessors from its earliest days. The so-called <a href="huguenot.html">Walloons</a> were among the first settlers sent to <a href="../loc/fortorange.html">Fort Orange</a> during the 1620s.

      <p>The cultural makeup of the <a href="../nnd.html">New Netherland Dutch</a> who 
        first settled on the site of Albany included a number of more and/or less 
        historically visible individuals who (for a variety of reasons) might 
        be characterized as of "French" rather than "Dutch" (or more generally 
        "<a href="https://www.google.com/#q=geermanic&spf=1">Germanic</a>") heritage. 
        Yes, we have made an "either - or" distinction here. However, indistinct 
        cultural borders between France and its <a href="#neighbors">neighbors</a> 
        warn us away from definitive pronouncements concerning identity. Through 
        the next generations in America, some of these individuals assimilated 
        and even flourished in the colonial <a href="../earlycity.html">city</a>. 
        Others retained their ancestral cultural attributes publicly and mostly 
        relocated to the Albany <a href="../albanycounty.html">hinterland</a> 
        and beyond. As with all of the <a href="../criteria.html">people of colonial 
        Albany</a>, the story of the so-called French in the early city takes 
        us to individual <a href="../res/bios.html">lives</a>. 
      <p>A basic distinction we can make regarding "the French" concerns their <a href="../churches.html">faith</a> as either Roman Catholics or as Protestants (also referred to as <a href="huguenot.html">Huguenots</a>). 

<p>Following the <a href="../res/visitors.html">visit</a> of the Jesuit missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Jogues">Isaac Jogues</a> during the 1640s, a number of French Catholics were notable residents of Albany during the seventeenth century. They included <a href="r/jrosie.html">Jan Rosie</a>, <a href="d/pdegarmo947.html">Pierre De Garmo</a>, and perhaps the Catholic <a href="p/frpruyn.html">Frans Pruyn</a>. Their notoriety was enhanced by prevailing suspicions that they were <a href="../7yw.html">agents</a> (spies is perhaps too strong) of both France and Rome! Members of Albany's <a href="m/marselis.html">Marselis</a> family sometimes were called "Marseilles" or "Ffrance" but were not included among those who were under suspicion. Frequently, they <a href="../marriages.html">married</a> Albany-born women and would set down roots in the colonial <a href="../earlycity.html">city</a>.

<p>Rank-and-file French speaking Protestants including members of what became known as the <a href="t/truax.html">Truax</a>, <a href="d/deforeest.html">De Foreest</a>, maybe <a href="l/lagrange.html">La Grange</a>, and <a href="d/jodewan6162.html">De Wandelaer</a> families found entry into the community mainstream much easier that the ordeal endured by the French speaking Catholics. By the end of the century, French speaking <a href="../newcomers.html">new</a>comers from downriver sought to participate in the Albany business and trading communities. Chief among them were <a href="l/anlispenard8081.html">Anthony Lispenard</a> followed by <a href="../cityfathers.html">city</a> father <a href="d/jodp.html">Johannes De Peyster</a>. 

<p>Catholics and Protestants, a number of these <a href="../familynames.html">families</a> persisted, intermarried, and even flourished in eighteenth century Albany.


<p>French and Native American ancestry <a href="m/gmlydius1473.html">Genevieve Masse</a> became the wife of frontier operative John Henry Lydius. Unlike her notorious husband who died in England, this beloved woman spent much of her notable and long life in a landmark home across from the <a href="../loc/elmtreecorner.html">Elm Tree Corner</a>.

<p>A number of French speaking &eacute;migr&eacute;s settled in Albany during the third quarter of the eighteenth century. They included the Alsacian <a href="m/jomaley.html">John Maley</a>. Others like <a href="d/stdl.html">Stephen De Lancey</a> were members of prominent downriver families. <a href="../inprog.html"><img src="../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=15 height=10 border=1 alt="much more to come"></a>

<p>Wartime &eacute;migr&eacute;s and refugees: Canadian <a href="r/jarob1163.html">James Robicheaux</a>; <a href="d/gedp7827.html">Gerardus De Peyster</a> and his father; "French merchant" <a href="f/jofont1889.html">John Fontfreyde</a>; <a href="../inprog.html"><img src="../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=15 height=10 border=1 alt="much more to come"></a>

<p>Fleeing the so-called Reign of Terror, during the 1790s Frenchmen came to America, to New York, and to Albany. By mid-decade a number of conspicuous &eacute;migr&eacute;s&acute; took up <a href="../art/mt.html#french">residence</a> in Albany and its environs. Among them were <a href="l/lolecout.html">Louis Le Couteulx</a> - a founder of <a href="../org/stmarys.html">St. Mary's</a>         Catholic Church and <a href="d/sidjard.html">Simon Desjardins</a> - pioneer of the Castorland settlement..  <a href="../inprog.html"><img src="../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=15 height=10 border=1 alt="much more to come"></a> 
		
		
<p>Opportunists and refugees, <a href="../newcomers.html">newcomers</a> flocked to America and to New York during the decades prior to the Civil War. Some of them came from France - although often via Canada. A few of them (compared to the more historically visible French speaking enclaves of the manufacturing cities) would settle in Albany. Unlike the nearby "mill towns" of Cohoes and Troy, the city of Albany did not attract large numbers of French Canadians during the first stage of the Industrial Revolution. The continuing story of the French in Albany appears to be one of more individual cases that begins after 1800 - a time <a href="../criteria.html">beyond the scope</a> of our concern. Our contribution on the French in early Albany seeks to account for those (hopefully every person) individuals who were in the community before 1800.    <a href="../inprog.html"><img src="../images/jpg/inprog.jpg" width=15 height=10 border=1 alt="much more to come"></a>.</p>

<p>My first history professor <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%22warren+roberts%22">Warren Roberts</a> also has <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1zG0cX3lckUC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=talleyrand+albany&source=bl&ots=n1s-qtB5bz&sig=qQinIkV4pklx5n8veO9tj6q0OyA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNk7Tw9fHRAhWH3oMKHVyTC2IQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=talleyrand%20albany&f=false">written</a> about these exotic characters in what he refers to as a "love letter" to his adopted city in a monograph entitled: <i> A Place in History: Albany in the Age of Revolution, 1775-1825</i> (published in 1998). As has been his custom, his study of this place focuses on the extraordinary characters (the "Greats") whose lives/contributions were not really concerned with and almost oblivious to the actual/factual development of early Albany community and society. This wonderful teacher has greatly influenced me over the years beginning with bringing me to understand that we engage the past from opposite directions.
