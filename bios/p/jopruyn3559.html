<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>John J. Pruyn</strong></a> was born in April 1755. He was the son of <a href="jopruyn3557.html">Johannes S.</a> and <a href="../va/janvalst.html">Jannetie Van Alstyne</a> Pruyn. He grew up a middle child in the large family of an Albany shoemaker and minor officeholder. His mother was the daughter of a mostly rural Albany County <a href="../va/valst.html">family</a> that traced its roots back to <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland. A number of John Pruyns were his Albany County contemporaries. This individual was known as "John J."   and also as "John I. Pruyn." 

<p>Coming of age at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, we expect to find substantive information on his wartime activities. Perhaps he was the John Pruyn who was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YYjPr7Ht7d8C&pg=PA383&lpg=PA383&dq=%22john+pruyn%22&source=web&ots=k4xwi_iklB&sig=_gW2CLPQxpnnpqPQZmZ5RlZb6uA#v=onepage&q&f=false">listed</a> as one of the Albany militiamen to be exempted from service in the Fall of 1779. Afterwards, he   was among those Albany residents who were accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3559">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>In January 1778, he was among those constables <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=genpub;cc=genpub;rgn=full%20text;idno=ABP1949.0001.001;didno=ABP1949.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000930">called</a> before the <a href="../../coc.html">Albany Committee</a> to take the oath of allegiance.

<p>By 1783, he had married Albany native <a href="../vp/arvplanck1106.html">Ariaantie Verplanck</a>. By 1793, at least five children had been christened at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1786">1786</a>, he was appointed chimney viewer for the third ward. In November 1798, "John Pruyn" was listed as a <a href="../../trades/baker.html">baker</a> on a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">list</a> of eligible jurors. In 1800 and afterwards, Dutch church accounts included payments to "John J. Pruyn" for baking bread sometimes "for sacrament."

<p>Perhaps he was the "John Pruyn" whose properties were valued in two places on the city assessment rolls for <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3559jp">1779</a> - the house and personal holdings in the third ward and the second ward <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3559">lot</a> of Samuel and John Pruyn" (perhaps his brother) was accorded a moderate assessment. However, in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3559">1788</a>, his real and personal property on upper State Street appeared on the first ward tax list. Two years later, the <a href="../../census1790.html#3559">census</a> configured his (John J. Pruyn) household in the same location next to the Websters' <a href="../../loc/elmtreecorner.html">corner</a> with two men, two boys, a female and one slave.

 


<p>"John I. Pruyn's wife" died late in 1795. After that, he relocated to the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, the assessment roll valued only his modest "house and lot." The census in <a href="../../census1800.html#3559">1800</a> showed only an adult man and two adolescent sons at the same riverside location. 

<p>John J. Pruyn died in March 1802 and was buried from the Dutch church. He had not reached his forty-seventh birthday.</p>
