<P><A href="#biography"><B>Jeremiah Pemberton</B></A> was born about 1700.</P>

<P>In January 1723, he married Albany native <a href="../../bios/b/mabradt4356.html">Maria Bradt</a> at the Loonenburgh <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a>. Between 1730 and 1735, five of their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where his family received services.</P>

<p>Jeremiah Pemberton derived at least some of his income from the <a href="../../corporation.html">city</a> of Albany. In 1723 and later, he was identified as the "bellman" and was paid for his services. He also was paid for cutting wood and for taking down fences. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1725">1725</a>, he was appointed constable in the second ward. The next year he was made high constable. In 1751, he was one of those who purchased (leased) the <a href="../../loc/ferry.html">ferry</a> for a year.</p>

<p>In 1730, he purchased a lot on the plain in the first ward for 45 pounds.

<p>Jeremiah Pemberton died sometime after March 1751. By that time, his only surviving son, <a href="../../bios/p/wpemberton420.html">William</a>, had become head of the Albany Pemberton family.</p>

        The life of <B>Jeremiah Pemberton</b> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography 
        number</a> 1040. This profile is derived chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based 
        resources</a>. Perhaps he was the son of William Pemberton who was a soldier 
        in the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison companies</a> and who was 
        identified as "sick" in 1702 and/or was the brazier who was made a freeman 
        of New York City in 1702! See <a href="../../sources.html#sh"> <i>SH</i></a>, 
        2:476, 479. His family does not appear to be directly related to the Pembertons 
        who settled in Albany after 1800!</p>
