<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>William Pepper</strong></a> was an <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">African-ancestry</a> resident of Albany and Watervliet during the late eighteenth-early nineteenth centuries. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.
		 
      <p>His wife was <a href="../s/elsimpson.html">Elizabeth Simpson</a>. Between 
        1795 and 1801, they had three children christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. She was buried from the church in September 1802. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#2551">1790</a>, the census identified 
        him as a resident of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> 
        and showed that the two members of his household were <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#fpc">free 
        people of color</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html#2551">1800</a>, 
        he was identifed as a resident of the second ward of Albany with four 
        "free persons" living in the household. His home was in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North 
        End</a> of Albany probably out on Pearl or Market Street. 
      <p>He seems to have earned his living as a laborer and paid taxes on real 
        and personal property in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second 
        ward</a> in <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> and 1802. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#2551">1788</a>, he was living 
        in a house with <a href="../d/nedavis.html">Ned Davis</a>. The notation 
        "House they live in" perhaps implies a less than casual connection. 
      <p>The Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> for 1815 
        listed him as a "laborer" living at 54 N. Market Street and identified 
        him as a "free person of color." In 1817, the directory called him a laborer 
        living at 28 Pine Street. That was the most recent reference to William 
        Pepper encountered so far.</p>
