<strong>Machtelt Post</strong></a> was the wife of Albany resident <a href="../q/joq2139.html">Johannes Quackenbush</a>. She probably was born during the 1650s and may have been the sister of Albany resident <a href="mapost2221.html">Maria Post</a> Bradt Corbett..

<p>She probably married Quackenbush during the 1670s as she had several children before 1683. Between 1684 and 1695, five more children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she was a member and regular baptism sponsor.  

<p>This Quackenbush family lived along the Hudson River near the north gate of the <a href="../../census1697.html#054">Albany</a> stockade. Quackenbush also owned a farm north of the Mohawk in today's Clifton Park. 

<p>The name of Machtelt Post Quackenbush last appeared in Albany records in December 1706 when she joined her husband as a baptism sponsor. Perhaps they moved to <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> where Johannes was interested in acquiring a farm.</p>
