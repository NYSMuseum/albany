<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Helena Pruyn</strong></a> was born in February 1681. She was the daughter in the large family of <a href="frpruyn.html">Frans</a> and Alida Pruyn - perhaps Albany's premier French family. Her father was an admitted Catholic but the children grew up in the Dutch church. Several of <a href="../../res/sp.html">Lena</a>'s siblings including at least two sisters joined her in presiding over mainline Albany households during the first half of the eighteenth century.

<p>In October 1701, she married <a href="../l/jalansing3720.html">Jacob H. Lansing</a> at her father's house but under the auspices of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1720, at least nine children were christened in the church where she was a long time member.

<p>These Lansings raised their family in a businessman's house on what became Market Street in the third ward.

<p>Helena Pruyn Lansing lost her husband in October 1756. Perhaps she died a year later or in 1761. In any event, she had lived for more than eighty years. </p>
