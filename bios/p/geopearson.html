<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>George Pearson</strong></a> is <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/Dutch-Colonies/2001-06/0993504802">said</a> to have been born in November 1769. We seek definitive information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and his re-location to Albany.

<p>His first wife was Claverack native Geertruy Huyck whom he married in January 1796. Their son was christened at the Albany Presbyterian church in June 1800. The   marriage produced eight children before her death in 1806. In December 1808, Pearson married Judith Van Vechten - daughter of a prominent <a href="../vv/tetvvechten2569.html">merchant</a>. Three children resulted from Pearson's second marriage.

<p>He was a <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church trustee as early as 1797. In 1802, he was among the first trustees of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html#upc">United Presbyterian Church</a>. In 1803, he was chosen as one of the first <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XqV1RcXwAUYC&pg=PA87&lpg=PA87&dq=%22george+pearson%22+vechten+albany&source=bl&ots=Bo4d4ltxV5&sig=Pd6hKNtIpYt-zSiP8Yr8vphhTAY&hl=en&ei=8_6tTOn7LYKC8gbqzcTABA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CCsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&q=%22george%20pearson%22%20vechten%20albany&f=false">managers</a> of the Albany St. Andrews Society.

<p>Among the properties burned in the <a href="../../fire.html">Fire</a> of 1793 was the <a href="../../doc/fire1793.html#waste">building</a> owned by "Caldwell & Pearson." 
<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1798gdb">1798</a>, a jury list called him a merchant. The assessment roll for <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> valued his first ward house and lots and also his lot in the second ward.
<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#gepe">1800</a>, his ten-person household was served by three <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slaves</a>. Pearson was among the Albany residents who began freeing them at that <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#1810">time</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a>, a voter list called him an "apothecary." In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#gp">1808</a>, he was among those State Street notables invited to the funeral of Henry J. Bleecker. In 1807, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjevr5085.html">will</a> of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer.

<p>In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA82&lpg=PA82&dq=%22pearson+george%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22pearson%20george%22&f=false">1813</a>, the first city directory identified him as a merchant living at <a href="../../loc/edownstate.html">59 State Street</a>. Subsequent directories thru 1816 identified him as an alderman for the first ward, director of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank</a> of Albany, and an officer of a number of civic organizations.
  
<p>George Pearson is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6YehIsw-eF8C&pg=PA368&lpg=PA368&dq=%22george+pearson%22+vechten+albany&source=bl&ots=qZmpyUUZp2&sig=8QR9jshNieuy1UX7snDB1yecuHo&hl=en&ei=sfytTMbwHIH88Aal1-zPBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CDEQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22george%20pearson%22%20vechten%20albany&f=false">said</a> to have died in May 1818. The city directory in 1818 and afterwards showed his widow as the householder of record in their State Street home.</p>
