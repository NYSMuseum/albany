<strong>Johannes S. Pruyn</strong></a> was born July 1723. He was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="sapruyn3576.html">Samuel</a> and <a href="../b/mabogert6126.html">Maria Bogert</a> Pruyn. He grew up in a blacksmith's home on a <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">back</a> street in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>.  He was known in the community as "Johannes S. Pruyn."

<p>By 1749, he had married <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck native <a href="../va/janvalst.html">Jannetie Van Alstyne</a>. Over the next sixteen years, the marriage produced seven children. He was a member and pewholder at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In March 1752, he was <a href="../../wills/willsapruyn3576.html">named</a> to share in the estate of his father.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1749">1749</a> and 1750, he was named a firemaster for the third ward. On a number of occasions he was paid by the city government for services. In 1759 and 1762, he was paid for services performed by his slave. On the latter occasion, his re-imbursement was partially offset by what Pruyn owed for lottery tickets.

<p>In 1756, he was identified as a <a href="../../trades/leather.html">shoemaker</a> on a <a href="../../census1756.html#306">census</a> of Albany householders. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3557">1763</a>, the name of "johannes S. pruyn" appeared on a list of Albany freeholders.  His third ward property was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment rolls</a>. At that time, this shoemaker also held a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">lot</a> along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>.


<p>Unless he was listed only as "John Pruyn,"  Johannes S. Pruyn probably died before 1790 as his holdings were no longer referenced on the census or assessment rolls.</p>
