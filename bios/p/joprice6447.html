      <P><a href="#sources"><b>John Price</b></a> was an Albany mainstay for most 
        of the second half of the eighteenth century. He was born about 1723 and 
        may have been the son of Lieutenant <a href="joprice1961.html">John</a> 
        and Mary Price. His sister, <a href="maprice8458.html">Mary</a>, married 
        Benjamin Hilton.</p>
      <p>He first appeared on the Albany community landscape in 1744 when he was 
        appointed constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. 
        By 1752, he had begun to witness Dutch church baptisms with <a href="../r/coryckman.html">Cornelia 
        Price</a> - presumably his wife. Their long marriage appears to have been 
        childless. He was a member of <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's 
        Anglican church</a>. 
      <p>John Price lived in the first ward. In <a href="../../census1756.html#226">1756</a>, 
        the census identified him as a sawmaker. From that time on, he was a first 
        ward fixture with his home prominently <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3">configured</a> 
        on city assessment rolls. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#6447">1763</a>, 
        his name appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. The census of <a href="../../census1790.html#6447">1790</a> 
        revealed that his household included five slaves - an indicator of his 
        wealth.</p>
      <p>At the outbreak of hostilities, he was appointed lieutenant in a city 
        <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. Subsequent commissions 
        called him "Captain" and "Major." At one time, he was a captain in the 
        <a href="http://www.threerivershms.com/nymilitiaalbany8.htm">Eighth Regiment</a> 
        of the Albany militia. He was active in the work of the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee 
        of Correspondence</a> - serving as a member for the first ward beginning 
        in 1776. He <a href="../../doc/ga1776.html">signed</a> the General Association 
        in 1776. He also supported a number of community-based <a href="../../doc/pettillman1779.html">petitions</a> 
        during the war years. 
      <p>On a number of occasions, he was paid from the city treasury for services 
        performed. 
      <p>In 1788, he joined a number of local men in <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#6447">signing</a> 
        a statement issued by the Albany Antifederal Committee. 
      <p>John Price filed a <a href="../../wills/willjoprice6447.html">will</a> 
        in December 1791. It named his wife, Cornelia and several <a href="../d/jadoty1877.html">nieces</a> 
        and nephews as heirs. It mentioned no children. He died a few days later 
        on December 6, 1791. The will passed probate the following January.</p>
