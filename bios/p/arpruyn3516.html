<strong>Arent Pruyn</strong></a> was born in May 1688. He was the son of Albany tailor <a href="frpruyn.html">Frans Janse</a> and <a href="alpruyn.html">Alida</a> Pruyn. His mother died  in 1704 and his father passed in 1712 when Arent was just twenty-two.

<p>In November 1714, Arent married brewer's daughter <a href="../g/cagansevoort4703.html">Catharina Gansevoort</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1727, six children had been christened in Albany.

<p>He made his home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. He was named <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1716">1716</a> and constable in 1718. He belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3516">1720</a>, he was identified as a freeholder in Albany.



<p>In or after 1730, he removed to <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> - perhaps to property his father had owned there. In May 1736, he purchased the Kinderhook farm of Cornelis Schermerhorn. Arent Pruyn was assessed for property in Kinderhook in 1744. The name appeared on a list of Kinderhook freeholders in 1763. Perhaps, that person was the Arent Pruyn born in Albany seventy-five years earlier.</p>
