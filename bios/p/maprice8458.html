<P><a href="#sources"><b>Mary Price</b></a> was born about 1720. She was the daughter of garrison officer <a href="joprice1961.html">John</a> and Mary Price.</p>


<p>In 1742, she married innkeeper and businessman <a href="../h/bhilton.html">Benjamin Hilton</a> the Albany Dutch church. However, like her husband she was a member at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> - where most of her children probably were baptized.</p>

<p>Over the next three decades, Mary raised her children and helped Benjamin Hilton run a popular Southside inn.</p>

<p>By 1779, Benjamin Hilton was dead and Widow Mary Hilton was listed as the owner of a first ward home and an additional lot as well. In <a href="../../census1790.html#8458">1790</a>, her household was served by four slaves. 

<p>Early in 1794, Mary began to liquidate her shares of real estate in her late husband's estate. Mary Price Hilton died in September 1794.</p>
