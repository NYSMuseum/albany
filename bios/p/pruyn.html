<P><a href="../../trades/cloth.html">T</a>ailor <a href="frpruyn.html"><b>Frans Janse</b></a> was the first member of the <a href="#sources">Pruyn family</a> in early Albany. Admittedly a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#oath">Catholic</a>, we seek documentation of his supposed <a href="../french.html">French</a> ancestry. Four sons established the Pruyn family in eighteenth century Albany. Daughters (<a href="anpruyn.html">Anna</a> and <a href="mapruyn3567.html">Maria</a>) became matriarchs of mainline early Albany families.</p>


<p>Three Pruyn households were in the city in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html">1742</a>, only <a href="sapruyn3576.html">Samuel Pruyn</a> was noted on the freeholder list for the city's three <a href="../../wards.html">wards</a> and surrounding <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck. Although the Pruyns occasionally held minor offices and often performed civic services, only Samuel Pruyn reached the station of <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">alderman</a> - representing the third ward from 1729 to 1732.
<p>In 1756, only the home of shoemaker <a href="../../census1756.html#306">John Prune</a> was listed on the <a href="../../census1756.html">census</a>. However, in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html">1763</a>, six "Pruyns" appeared on a list of Albany freeholders. 
 
<p>But in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>, seven Pruyn families were counted in the booming city including the Pearl Street home of businessman <a href="jopruyn3558.html">John F. Pruyn</a>. The family also became prominent in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../sources.html#ad">1813</a>, the first city directory <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22pruyn&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22pruyn%20&f=false">counted</a> six Pruyn-name households with Albany addresses. All but one of them were located in close proximity to the first Pruyn home on what became <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p><a href="http://librarypostcards.blogspot.com/2009/03/1908-pruyn-library-albany-new-york.html"><img src="../../images/jpg/bldg/pruynlibrary.jpg" align=right border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4 width=200 alt="Pruyn Library - a Dutch Revival ediface razed in 1963"></a>Albany artist Francis Pruyn created an often-utilized <a href="../../na/vrmh.html">sketch</a> of the first Van Rensselaer Manor House just prior to its destruction in 1839.

<p>The name "Pruyn" has been a part of Albany's historic iconography in a number of manifestations. The Pruyn Library, a colonial revival building on the corner of what became Clinton Avenue and North Pearl Street - and shown in this vintage postcard, was an Albany landmark from 1901 until it was razed in 1963. It was named for native son John V. L. Pruyn (1811-77), jurist, congressman, and noted antiquarian. 

<p>The Augustus Pruyn collection of photographs and artwork at the New York State Library is an important resource for the history of Albany. The <a href="http://www.pruynhouse.org/index.php/about-pruyn-house">Pruyn House</a> was built for <a href="cafpruyn.html">Casparus F. Pruyn</a> in 1830 and is the headquarters of the <A href="https://www.colonie.org/departments/historian/historicalsociety/">Historical Society of the Town of Colonie</a>.</p>
