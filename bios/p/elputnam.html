<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Elisha Putnam</strong></a> was born in May 1765.  He was a middle child in the large family of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YN4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=%22stephen+putnam%22&source=bl&ots=1lVyZ3ZRvo&sig=0mloUdygG-JISwZKYc6R6DMbF9U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K6QOUI6EBOXx0gHL8oHgBg&ved=0CEQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22stephen%20putnam&f=false">Stephen</a> and Mary Gibbs Putnam of Sutton, Massachusetts. He is <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ne_albany_bio2.htm">said</a> to have been the nephew of Gen. Israel Putnam. The first member this Putnam family <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YN4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA5&lpg=PA5&dq=%22john+putnam%22&source=bl&ots=1lVyZ3ZRvo&sig=0mloUdygG-JISwZKYc6R6DMbF9U&hl=en&sa=X&ei=K6QOUI6EBOXx0gHL8oHgBg&ved=0CEQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q=%22john%20putnam&f=false">settled</a> in Salem, Massachusetts by 1630. A number of same-name individuals were our subject's contemporaries.

<p>Perhaps he followed his later reknowned older <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Putnam">brother</a> to New York after the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence. This son of <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a> also was <a href="../../fhg.html#nea">said</a> to have come to Albany with his brother David in 1790. He was a builder and something of an architect although we have not yet uncovered the sources of those skills. Aged twenty-five in 1790, we seek defining information on his path to Albany. An Elisha Putnam also was involved in the early days of the new city called <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a>.


<p>In December 1792, Elisha married Hester, the daughter of <a href="../j/stjohnson.html">Stephen W. Johnson</a> under the auspices of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. However, he was a member and elder of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church. By <a href="http://search.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=View&r=0&dbid=7734&iid=4433435_00140&fn=Elisha&ln=Putnam&st=r&ssrc=&pid=560598">1820</a>, his household encompassed nine members as ultimately <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YN4UAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA282&lpg=PA282&dq=%22stephen+johnson%22++1834+albany&source=bl&ots=1lUE12WOyp&sig=PyM0PIGTVadfPSsiuUwhICICYkM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1oHXT7SUGZC36QGqscGjAw&ved=0CEcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22stephen%20johnson%22%20%201834%20albany&f=false">eleven</a> children had been christened at Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>By <a href="../../census1800.html#8557">1800</a>, his Pearl Street home included four children and had become a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1810c">fix</a>ture on the second ward census.

<p>In 1797, an Albany newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA189&lpg=PA189&dq=%22messrs.putnam+and+hooker%22&source=bl&ots=x7BXVPbLrm&sig=Q6YQyYQBCHZHsttxPL8LIPBkTR0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lZkOULSmBYeJ6AGLuIGYAQ&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22messrs.putnam%20and%20hooker%22&f=false">identified</a> him with <a href="../h/phhooker.html">Philip Hooker</a> his next-door neighbor, as the undertakers and the architects of the new <a href="../../drc.html#north">Dutch church</a> also located on Pearl Street. He is said to have been the architect of the Presbyterian and possibly the <a href="../../stpeters.html">Ep</a>iscopal churches as well.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">1801</a>, he was a member of an Albany <a href="../../firemasters.html">fire</a> company. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1803bf">1803</a>, he was listed as a carpenter and a freeholder. He was a member and trustee of the <a href="../../ams.html">Albany Mechanics Society</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/listhjb1808.html#3">1808</a>, he was among those worthies invited to a public funeral in Albany.


<p>His residence at 78 North Pearl Street was included in the first city directory in 
<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22putnam&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22putnam&f=false">1813</a>. At that time, he was listed as a builder. Beginning in 1797, he was involved in a number of city-based <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transactions. 

<p>Over the years, <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">ass</a>essment rolls valued his varied (workshop, lots) properties modestly. Beginning in<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=%22putnam&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22putnam&f=false">1813</a>, he was identified as the Superintendant of the Albany Water Works. He also has been <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ne_albany_bio2.htm#75">credited</a> with nail and other metals production and with the building of the Erie Canal. 

<p>In 1847, he self-published his lengthy work of spiritual prophesy entitled <i><a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SvxBAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP9&lpg=PP9&dq=%22elisha+putnam%22+%22the+crisis&source=bl&ots=RmPDlN1vbN&sig=QV7DWC_h5D0mmr-IWhtknYD6Deo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hbYOUKfnOqTF6wHF6YHoBA&ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22elisha%20putnam%22%20%22the%20crisis&f=false">T</a>he crisis, or, Last trumpet an antidote for popular opinion either in church or state</i>. 

<p>He was <a href="http://www.billputman.com/New%20York%20Census%201850.htm">counted</a> for the last time on the Albany census in 1850. At that time he was living alone as his wife had passed in 1835. Elisha Putnam <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA322&lpg=PA322&dq=%22elisha+putnam%22+albany&source=bl&ots=Sq9rQIxpwk&sig=unHEG1nvbGEmEXoxvvZSsOyQoag&hl=en&sa=X&ei=G4EOUNe9KOjB0QGF4YDwAw&ved=0CEoQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22elisha%20putnam%22%20albany&f=false">died</a> in Albany in February 1854. He was <a href="../../dead.html">interred</a> at the Albany Rural Cemetery. This long-lived Yankee had been an important architect of the new Albany for more than fifty of his eighty-nine years.</p>
