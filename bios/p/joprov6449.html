<strong>Johannes Provoost</strong></a> is <a href="http://www.delamontagne.org/history.htm">said</a> to have been born in Amsterdam in 1636. He was the son of Elias and Agnietie Provoost. His father died that same year and Agnietie re-married. In 1638, Johannes came to New Netherland with his mother and step-father. He was the only surviving child of his mother's three marriages. 

<p>Johannes Provoost married three times. His first wife was <a href="../s/sastaats4610.html">Sara Staats</a>. Following her death, he married Sara Webbers in June 1685. Two years later, he married the widow Anna Mauritz. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and his children - all from the first marriage, were baptized in Albany.

<p>Provoost's mother's third husband was New Netherland official Johannes De La Mongagne. As an "excellent penman," Johannes was named clerk and deputy clerk under his step-father in a number of offices including that of clerk at Fort Orange. He was <a href="../../inprog.html">known</a> in Beverwyck/Albany as a notary, clerk, and secretary. He is said to have been "sheriff of Albany" in 1678. In 1684, he was <a href="../../lists/list1684ta.html">identified</a> as the "vendue master."

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#123">1679</a>, his name appeared on a list of Albany householders.

<p>In 1685, he filed a joint will with his second wife. Johannes Provoost was dead by August 1696 when his estate was to be sold to pay his debts.</p>
