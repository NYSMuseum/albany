<strong>Mary Price</strong></a> was born during the early 1770s. She probably was not the child of Albany mainstay <a href="joprice6447.html">John Price</a>. We seek information on her background and early life.

<p>She was the wife of  Albany resident <a href="../c/geocharles7588.html">George Charles</a>. We have not located their marriage in the extant records of the early Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. However, their children were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> between 1796 and 1803.

<p>Her husband had a landmark <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=%22charles+george%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22charles%20george%22&f=false">tannery</a> at 146 and other addresses on South Pearl Street at least until 1830. He also was a city leather inspector.

<p>In January 1818, she and her husband <a href="../../res/realestate.html">sold</a> a lot on Liberty Street (formerly <a href="../../streets.html#liberty">Grass Lane</a>).

<p>Mary Price Charles lost her husband in 1848. The newspaper noted that Mrs. Mary Charles died in April 1851 at the age of seventy-four.

The life of Mary Price Charles has not been assigned a CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a>.

and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. <dd>The subject of this sketch should not be confused with her supposed mother-in-law, Widow <a href="../h/mahogan1118.html">Mary Hogan Charles</a> whose household was configured on the census in 1790 and in 1800 and whose property was valued on the Albany assessment of 1788.
