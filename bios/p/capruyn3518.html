<strong>Casparus Pruyn</strong></a> was born in May 1734. He was the son of <a href="frpruyn3537.html">Frans S.</a> and possibly his second wife, <a href="../vi/alviveren2277.html">Alida Van Iveren</a> Pruyn. He grew up in a prominent businessman's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>

<p>In December 1762, he married <a href="../g/cagroesbeck3273.html">Catharina Groesbeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1776, six of their children had been christened at the church where he was a member, pewholder, officer, and occasional baptism sponsor.

<p>After living for a time with his widowed mother, this Pruyn family established itself at 74 Pearl Street where they lived for many years. 

<p>Like many members of his family, Casparus was a blacksmith. Beginning in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1759">1759</a>, he served as firemaster in the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1785">1785</a>, he also served as assessor. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1793">1793</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the second ward. During the 1760s, he had belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.

<p>In 1775, he was appointed lieutenant in the militia. In his fifties through most of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he was exempted from active duty in <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#3518">1778</a>. Afterwards, he was accorded a land <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3518">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the city militia regiment.

<p>In March 1792, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willjorbleecker201.html">will</a> of a Pearl Street neighbor. 

<p>Casparus Pruyn owned <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slaves</a> (three in <a href="../../census1790.html#3518">1790</a>) but had freed them by the census of <a href="../../census1800.html#3518">1800</a>.
  
<p>Casparus Pruyn died in October 1817. He had lived for more than eighty-three years. His son carried on at 74 North Pearl Street for a number of years. His will passed probate in 1825.</p>
