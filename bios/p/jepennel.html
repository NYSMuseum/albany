<P><a href="../../res/sp.html">Sp</a>elled variously, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jeremiah Pennel</strong></a> appears to have been born prior to 
        1756. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> 
        and path to Albany. He may have migrated from Pennsylvania where the Pennel 
        family was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=hNAwAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA283&lpg=PA283&dq=%22william+pennel%22+pennsylvania&source=bl&ots=-hI0qqcPTA&sig=5vPZGnThGN7mAWlXzPuMG_SkfX8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=aafHVMmRN43nsASdmYDwCA&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q=%22william%20pennel%22%20pennsylvania&f=false">established</a>. 
        However, a same-named individual was <a href="http://hfa.haskells.net/haskellfamilyna/pafg42.htm#19737">born</a> 
        in 1750 in Falmouth, Maine.

<p>Between 1777 and 1779, the name of a Jeremiah Pennel <a href="http://www.fold3.com/document/9587004/">appeared</a> on a roster of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3rd_Continental_Artillery_Regiment">Third 
        Artillery Regiment</a> of the Continental army. Later, the name appeared 
        on a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=TdlGAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA541&lpg=PA541&dq=%22jeremiah+pennel%22&source=bl&ots=7ukbGmXj2Q&sig=iCIOCc10vlBnDuQyjFmcoktCORw&hl=en&sa=X&ei=c4XHVMzSCYzIsQSp34LADg&ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22jeremiah%20pennel%22&f=false">Congressional 
        list</a> of Revolutionary war pensioners at least twice. <p>However, during 
        that time, his name has not been <a href="../qqqq.html">encountered</a> 
        in the records of Albany's wartime governing or administrative bodies. 
      <p>By January 1784, he was in Albany where he married one "<a href="../h/anhilton.html">Annatje 
        Hilten</a>" at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. In 
        August 1788, their daughter Ruth was christened in both the Presbyterian 
        and Episcopal <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>. Census returns 
        for 1790 and 1800 point to additional children. 
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#jepe">1788</a>, the house an 
        lot of Jeremiah Pennell was assessed in the first ward. Nearby were the 
        houses of a number of his new in-laws the Hiltons. 
      <p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#jepe">1790</a>, his first ward household 
        held five family members. A decade later, his <a href="../../census1800.html#jepe">household</a> 
        was listed on the census for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. 
        At that time, two adolescent boys, a male over 45 years of age, two adolescent 
        females, and a woman aged 26-45 were accounted for in that domicile. In 
        <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his house, lot, and 
        personal property all were valued on the first ward assessment roll. 
      <p>In October 1791, he was <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">identified</a> 
        as a fireman in Division Four. 
      <p>Perhaps he was kin to <a href="aapennel.html">Aaron Pennel</a>, who <a href="../../doc/nn2.html#aape">died</a> 
        in Albany in 1794 at the age of twenty-five. 
      <p>In August 1805, Jeremiah Pennel was buried from the Dutch church. His 
        pall and hearse were "gratis." His widow was dead by September 1807 when 
        letters of administration were issued on the estate of "Hannah Pannel."</p>
