<strong>John F. Pruyn</strong></a> was born in December 1739. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="frpruyn3537.html">Frans S.</a>  and <a href="../vi/alviveren2277.html"> Alida Van Iveren</a> Pruyn. He grew up in Albany and was well-known as "John F. Pruyn."

<p>In July 1769, he married thirty-two-year-old <a href="../t/geerteyck4867.html">Geertie Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage may have been childless as no christenings were recorded in the church records. However, he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>These Pruyns lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> in the heart of the second ward residential district. He also owned at least one lot along <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. John was a merchant and skipper who served the community as constable, chimney viewer, juror, militiaman, and firemaster. He also was a contractor of the city.

<p>He first stood up for American rights in 1766 when he joined with his neighbors in <a href="../../solconst.html#3558">signing</a> a constitution for the Albany Sons of Liberty. Only in his thirties during th conflict, he was affiliated with the Albany militia and later received a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a>.

<p>Without children, his <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3558">modest home</a> also housed six slaves in <a href="../../census1790.html#3558">1790</a>. By  1800, he was beginning to set them free. 
</p>


<p>John F. Pruyn died in March 1815 at the age of seventy-five. His wife had passed eight years earlier. His will passed probate the day after his funeral.</p>
