<strong>Frans S. Pruyn</strong></a> was born in March 1704. He was the first son of <a href="sapruyn3576.html">Samuel</a> and <a href="../b/mabogert6126.html">Maria Bogert</a> Pruyn. He was known as "Franciscus" or "Frans S." Pruyn to help prevent confusion with <a href="frpruyn3536.html">Frans Pruyn, Jr.</a>, a contemporary who was twenty-one-years older. He grew up as part of a relatively small family in a  landmark home located on the corner of Maiden Lane and Middle Alley.

<p>His first wife is <a href="../../inprog.html">said</a> to have been "Anna." In July 1726, he married <a href="../vi/alviveren2277.html">Alida Van Iveren</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1744, he had fathered eight children who were christened in the Albany church where he was a regular baptism sponsor.

<p>In 1731, he was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. In 1745, he was elected assistant. And in 1761, he was elected <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> - marking him as one of the community's leading businessmen. Two years later, his name appeared on a list of Albany <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3537">freeholders</a>.

<p>His father was a blacksmith who named him along with his mother and brothers as heirs in his <a href="../../wills/willsapruyn3576.html">will</a>. In <a href="../../census1756.html#149">1756</a>, his house was configured on the Albany census. He also was identified as a "smith" - which had several <a href="../../makers.html#metal">meanings</a> at that time. Because he was an alderman, he probably was more <a href="../../econ/comec.html#cec">merchant</a> than metalworker. In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1767tl">1767</a>, his second ward home was valued on the assessment roll.


<p>Frans S. Pruyn may have been buried in August 1767. His widow and <a href="capruyn3518.html">son</a> carried on in their Pearl Street home.</p>
