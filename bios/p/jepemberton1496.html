<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Jeremiah Pemberton</strong></a> was born in May 1754. He was the son of <a href="wpemberton420.html">William</a> and <a href="../d/sadrury475.html">Sarah Drury</a> Pemberton. He was christened at <a href="../../stpeters.html">St. Peter's</a> church where his parents were members. He grew up in a moderate sized family in the <a href="../../loc/southside.html">So</a>uthside home of a <a href="../../census1756.html#181">pr</a>ominent riverman and British sympathizer.

<p>By 1776, he had married Susanna <a href="../b/bradt.html">Bradt</a>. Their son "Adam" was baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on January first. Other children followed. Jeremiah had been named for his newcomer <a href="jepemberton1040.html">grandfather</a> who married an Albany <a href="../b/mabradt4356.html">Bradt</a> in 1723. 

<p>According to later documents, at the beginning of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a> he was living on a farm owned by his father. In September 1776, he voluntarily appeared before the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a>, took the oath of allegience, signed the test, and was discharged. However, two months later, he was identified as "disaffected" and was ordered to be taken into custody and sent to the New York Convention under guard. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../friends.html">Tory</a> from the "Hellebergh" section of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">R</a>ensselaerswyck. By then, his father had been confined <a href="../../doc/petwpemberton.html">and</a> exiled from Albany. 

<p>His status and whereabouts for the next year are unclear until October 1777 when General Burgoyne asked him to deliver a dispatch to General Clinton in the lower Hudson Valley. Having difficulty finding Clinton while avoiding detection, he went into hiding in the woods. He finally reached New York in March.

<p>Jeremiah Pemberton claimed he was twice a prisoner of war in New York and that he commanded a company in defense of the Bergen [New Jersey] blockhouse. He also claimed to be an ensign in "<a href="../j/ebjessup1051.html">Je</a>ssup's Regiment of Loyal Americans. 

<p>In October 1782, his name (with two women and three older children) appeared on a <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~cannb/ShipList_Amphitrite.html">list</a> of those who had arrived at Annapolis, Nova Scotia on a ship from New York.

<p>Afterwards, his Albany property is <a href="http://www.gaspe-loyalists.ca/Docs/ACNY5.pdf">said</a> to have been confiscated. At that time, Jeremiah was identified as a cordwainer.

<p>In March 1786, from Annapolis, Nova Scotia he submitted a claim for lost livestock and property. He stated that he was living in Nova Scotia, tried to improve land granted by "the King," but "never having been accustomed to labor, [his] prospects are deplorable." He stated that he had a wife and several children and that they were"in want." His claim was rejected by the British. However, in that year <a href="http://www.royalprovincial.com/military/mems/nj/clmall.htm">a</a> Jeremiah Pemberton was one of the commissioners who were examining such claims. Nova Scotia <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=eg6gqfp1_U8C&pg=PA269&lpg=PA269&dq=%22jeremiah+pemberton%22+%22nova+scotia%22&source=bl&ots=9u8kh-Urk8&sig=agiGDycgNOUSFhYY4aGU8HIl2sw&hl=en&ei=GGabTNeBO8Kclgeb4tHjCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q&f=false">Chief Justice</a> Jeremiah Pemberton perhaps was <a href="../qqqq.html">different</a> individual. 
 
<p>Albany native and American <a href="../../friends.html">Loyalist</a> Jeremiah Pemberton died <a href="../qqqq.html">sometime</a> thereafter.</p>
