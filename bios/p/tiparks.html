<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Timothy Parks</strong></a> lived in Albany for a time during the 1780s and 1790s. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. We have not yet connected him to contemporary resident <a href="alparks.html">Alexander Parks</a>.

<p>Perhaps he was from Connecticut <a href="http://www02.us.archive.org/stream/stranggenealogyd00fros/stranggenealogyd00fros_djvu.txt">or</a> Westchester County. 

<p>He has been <a href="http://dunhamwilcox.net/ny/ny_rev_3d_reg.htm">identified</a> as a soldier in the Third Regiment of the New York Line and/or an enlisted man in Col. Morris Graham's regiment of Levies. Perhaps, those references are to a same-named contemporary from Westchester County. 

<p>During the 1780s, his <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dwKDLmZnBZ0C&pg=PA319&lpg=PA319&dq=%22timothy+parks%22+albany&source=bl&ots=0TmnvlLozr&sig=8wcQiDSLNW63OM-Ux7jJuZhCCEQ&hl=en#v=onepage&q=%22timothy%20parks%22%20albany&f=false">accounts</a> were submitted and paid from the Albany city treasury.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#tipa">1788</a>, his modest personal property was taxed under the lot owned by <a href="../l/jolivingston5017.html">John Livingston</a> in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../census1790.html#tipa">1790</a>, his <a href="../../loc/southside.html">Southside</a> household included six people and was configured separately.

<p>Perhaps, he was the "Parks" who owed 17 shillings to the <a href="../../wills/willwmcharles.html">estate</a> of William Charles in 1793.</p>

<p><center><b>Summary of information on the homicide of young Lyman Parker:</b> (first ward householder in <a href="../../census1800.html#lypa">1800</a>)</center></p>

<p>Lyman Parker 25 Sep 1801 Albany NY <a href="http://surnamearchive.com/records/records105.htm"> was shot</a> on 21 Sep abt midnight it is believed by Timothy Parks whose house he was passing


<p>In the Fall of 1801, the newspaper posted this notice:
<p><blockquote>TIMOTHY PARKS, imprisoned in Albany on suspicion of being the murderer of Lyman Parker, in the night of the 21st of September last, as hereto fore mentioned in this paper, was on the 28th ult. tried and convicted in the Supreme Court, and has received sentence of death. The Court have assigned the 11th day of December next, for his execution.
<dd><a href="http://www.correctionhistory.org/hangings/hangdates4.html">1801</a> A male white named Timothy Parks, was hanged Dec. 10 this year in Albany for the Sept. 21 sniper slaying of passerby Lyman Parker, also a male white, shot for no apparent reason, according to Hearn.</blockquote>
<br></blockquote> 
<p>The story of Albany resident Timothy Parks probably ends with his execution on December 10, 1801. This offering presents <a href="../../res/bios.html">only</a> a summary of available information on his life. We move on for <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">now</a>!</p>
