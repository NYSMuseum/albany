<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Pruyn</b></a> was born in February 1667. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="frpruyn.html">Frans</a> and <a href="alpruyn.html">Alida</a> Pruyn. His father was a French-ancestry tailor who settled in <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> and established the family in Albany. The patriarch lived until 1712.</p>


<p>In September 1703, Johannes was approaching middle age whe he married a much younger <a href="../s/amsanders1420.html">Amelia Sanders</a> at her mother's Albany house. By 1714, the marriage had produced three children who were baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a lifelong member and frequent baptism sponsor.</p>

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3555">1699</a>, he joined with his Albany neighbors in swearing allegiance to the king of England. He was an Albany property holder of <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3555">some means</a> who owned additional land near <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. He served as juror, was elected assistant alderman for the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> in 1710, and served as <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> for the third ward from 1718 to 1725. He belonged to an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a> and his name was included on lists of Albany <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3555">freeholders</a>. In 1748, the <a href="../../wills/willdtbroeck33.html">will</a> of his neighbor stated that Pruyn's house and lot were on the east side of <a href="../../streets.html#middle">James Street</a> - three doors south of what became Steuben street.</p>   

<p>Johannes Pruyn died in August 1749 and was buried from the Albany church.</p>
