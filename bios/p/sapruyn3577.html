<strong>Samuel Pruyn, Jr. </strong></a> was born in September 1728. He was the son of <a href="frpruyn3537.html">Frans S. Pruyn</a> and his second wife, <a href="../vi/alviveren2277.html">Alida Van Iveren</a> Pruyn. He grew up in a large combined family in a merchant's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street<a/>. His father was an Albany mainstay who also had a smithy.

<p>In February 1756, Samuel Jr. married <a href="../t/cote4862.html">Neeltie Ten Eyck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1768, five children had been christened in the church where he was a pewholder, deacon, and regular baptism sponsor.

<p>This Samuel Pruyn was an Indian <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> and skipper who set up his Albany home in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. His business was varied including retailing and <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a>. He served as <a href="../../org/cc.html#1749">constable</a> and <a href="../../org/cc.html#1752">firemaster</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1764.html">1764</a>, his name appeared on a petition signed by Albany merchants. In <a href="../../solconst.html#3577">1766</a>, he joined his neighbors in signing the constitution of the Albany Sons of Liberty.  In 1767, he was a lieutenant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia<a/> company. 

<p>Following the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">hostilities</a> in 1775, he was approaching fifty. He made himself useful to the Revolutionaries by transporting men and supplies on the river, using his home to confine prisoners, and contributing financially to the cause. In 1778, his name appeared on a list of <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html#3577">Associated Exempts</a> who could be called to service in case of an emergency. Afterwards, he received a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3577">bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment. 

<p>Samuel Pruyn, Jr.  died in December 1785 and was buried by his church. His widow <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wsp">lived</a> with her son and survived until 1817.</p>
