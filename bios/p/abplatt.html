<P>In June 1802, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Abigail Platt</strong></a> married Albany resident <a href="../e/wmeaston.html">William Easton</a> at the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. Thus, we might surmise that she was born within a few years of 1780. We seek defining information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.


<p>At the time of their marriage, William had been <a href="../../census1800.html#7914">living</a> with his recently widowed mother and Abigail probably joined them.

<p>In October 1806, Abigail Easton (wife of William) was identified in the Presbyterian records as a communicant with a certificate from "a sister church." A number of other Platts joined the church during the early 1800s. Perhaps they were her kin. However, we have not found evidence of children of their own.

<p>By <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA64&lpg=PA64&dq=%22easton%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=easton&f=false">1813</a>, these Eastons had relocated to their own home on North Pearl Street where William practiced the shoemaker's trade.

<p>Beyond charting their changes of address, over the next three decades the activities of Abigail and William have escaped our ongoing sweeps of <a href="../../res/irs.html">online</a> and community-based resources.
 
<p>William Easton died in April 1841 at the age of seventy-seven. In April <a href="https://archive.org/stream/annalsofalbany10munsuoft/annalsofalbany10munsuoft_djvu.txt">1842</a>, the newspaper reported that "Mary, wife of Thomas L. Hartness, died in New York, aged 30, and was buried from the residence of her mother, Mrs. Abigail Easton, 55 Maiden lane." Then at least in her early eighties, Abigail Platt Easton would have died sometime thereafter.</p>
