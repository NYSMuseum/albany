<P>Widow <a href="#sources"> <strong>Mary Price</strong></a> was the the head of an Albany household in <a href="../../census1800.html#mapr">1800</a>.  We seek information on her <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> (particularly her birth family) and path to Albany. We <a href="../../res/guess.html">surmise</a> that this woman is distinct from other same-named individuals living in Albany during her lifetime.

<p>Based on the census listing, her household in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> consisted of a young man, three girls under 16, and Mary herself who was born prior to 1756. Her home was listed next to that of George Charles whose wife was the former <a href="maprice.html">Mary Price</a>.

<p>Beginning with the first edition in <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=%22widow+mary%22&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22widow%20mary%22&f=false">1813</a>, she was listed in the city directory as a widow and living at 69 Washington (then South Pearl) Street. After 1816, her name no longer appeared in the annual listings.

<p>In July 1814, widow Mary Price was identified for the first time as a communicant of the First <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian</a> church.

<p>With so many parts of the life and passing of Mary Price still <a href="../qqqq.html">unanswered</a>, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
