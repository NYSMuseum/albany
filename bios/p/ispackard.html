<P><a href="#sources"><b>Isaac Packard</b></a> was born in Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1737. 

<p>By the late 1760s, he married <a href="../r/eurawson.html">Eunice Rawson</a> of Milton, Massachusetts. The marriage produced ten children as these Packards <a href="../../yankinv.html">migrated</a> across the Commonwealth during the 1770s and 80s.</p>

<p>By <a href="../../census1790.html#isp">1790</a>, he had relocated to Albany and settled in the first ward. He was a house carpenter who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Hill_(Albany,_New_York)">worked</a> on re-building Philip Van Rensselaer's 
<a href="../vr/pvr.html#home">Cherry Hill</a>.</p>

<p>In 1791, his daughter, <a href="eupackard.html">Eunice</a>, married Yankee newcomer Hezekiah Tracy. Two years later, daughter <a href="sapackard.html">Sarah</a>, married their wealthy older neighbor, <a href="../w/phwendell2702.html">Philip Wendell</a>.</p>

<p>Isaac Packard died in Albany on March 3, 1795.  A month later, letters of administration were issued on his estate. His <a href="https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/91860396/isaac-packard">stone</a> eventually found its way to <a href="../../loc/arc.html">Albany Rural Cemetery</a>. Its inscription read that "Capt." Isaac Packard had lived 57 years, 5 months, and five days. His widow lived on in Albany until her passing in 1824.</p>
