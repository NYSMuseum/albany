<P><a href="#sources"><b>Frans Janse</b></a> established the <a href="pruyn.html">Pruyn family</a> in early Albany.</p>

      <p>He was in Albany by October 1661 when he paid a deposit on the purchase of 
        a horse. In May of that year, he had shared a lease for a houselot and 
        barn in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.</p>

<p>His wife was <a href="alpruyn.html">Alida</a> - mother of at least eleven 
        Pruyn children. She was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Du</a>tch church. He was not 
        - although he did witness the baptisms of several children there. In 1699, 
        he would not to sign a <a href="../../lists/list1699.html">loyalty oath</a> - calling himself a papist! He probably 
        was of French ancestry. </p>

</p>These Pruyns settled into a house on the corner of <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl</a> Street and Maiden Lane. By <a href="../../census1679.html#3535">1679</a>, he was identified as a mainline householder. He practiced the <a href="../../trades/cloth.html">tailor's</a> trade. He owned additional real property within the Albany stockade. In 1706, took a mortgage on a farm in Kinderhook.</p>

<p>His daughter Maria married <a href="../g/elgerr6006.html">Elbert Gerritse</a> who followed Frans in the tailor's trade and, in <a href="../../census1697.html#108">1697</a>, shared Pruyn's second ward home.</p>

<p>Alida Pruyn died in 1704. Frans lived on in his comfortable Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3535">home</a> until his death in May of 1712.</p>
