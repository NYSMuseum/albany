<P><a href="#sources"> <strong>Elizabeth Pangburn</strong></a> was the spouse of Albany resident <a href="../b/wmboardman7367.html">William Boardman</a>. Perhaps she was born in May 1775 and was a younger daughter in the family of William and Elizabeth (perhaps Vandenbogert) Bogert Pangburn. In <a href="../../census1790.html#wmpa">1790</a>, that Pangburn household was configured on the census of <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. The Pangburns then became mainstays in the new town of <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a> in the vicinity of what became known as New Scotland Road. 

<p>Elizabeth probably was married (record not found in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>) during the 1790s. These Boardmans were living in Albany by the late 1790s when two sons were christened in the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian church</a>. A number of subsequent offspring were buried from there at least until 1835. In <a href="../../census1800.html#7367">1800</a>, their first ward household accounted for the couple and two young boys. For some or all of his time in Albany, William Boardman was known as Sexton of the Presbyterian church. 

<p>William Boardman died in April 1835. "Elizabeth Boardman" appears to have been alive in December 1835 when her thirteen-year-old daughter was buried from the Albany Presbyterian church. Perhaps that reference is to a child of her son William. In any event, we <a href="../../inprog.html">seek</a> defining information on her later life and passing.</p>
