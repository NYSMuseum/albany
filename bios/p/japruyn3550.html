<strong>Jacob J. Pruyn</strong></a> was born in January 1749. He was the son of <a href="jopruyn3557.html">Johannes<a> and <a href="../va/janvalst.html">Jannetie Van Alstyne</a> Pruyn. He grew up in a shoemaker's home in the <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. This individual seems to have been known as "Jacob J. Pruyn."


<p>In March 1786, he would have been in his mid-thirties when he married <a href="../d/codef4721.html">Neeltie</a> (Cornelia or Eleanor) <a href="../d/codef4721.html">De Foreest</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1796, five children had been christened at the Albany church where he was a member. 


<p>We believe that Jacob J. Pruyn was an Albany resident - possibly the individual identified as a "mariner" in 1784. Perhaps he lived in the <ahref="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> near the waterfront and owned a house and storehouse on lower Maiden Lane. He is said to have owned a blacksmith shop on or near the middle dock during the mid-1780s. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4726">1788</a>, his budding family was living in the household of his father-in-law.   </p>


<p>Although not on any wartime rolls, Jacob J. Pruyn was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany militia regiment.

<p>His wife, "Eleanor," freed a number of slaves during the early <a href="../../art/art-jls.html#1810">1800s</a>. That would have been consistent with his household configuration on the third ward census in <a href="../../census1800.html#3550">1800</a> - which identified four slaves. 

<p>Perhaps this Jacob J. Pruyn died after 1810!</p>
