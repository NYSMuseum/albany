<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Alexander Parks</strong></a> lived in Albany in <a href="../../census1800.html#alpa">1800</a>. We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany.

<p>Perhaps, he was a member of the <a href="http://cherylmorris.com/Parkes/parkes0001.htm#id35557">Parks family</a> of eighteenth century New Hampshire or <a href="http://www.geocities.ws/judylangen/pedigree/north001.htm">North Carolina</a>. However, his name probably points to <a href="../irish.html">Scottish or Ulster</a> origins. We have not yet connected him to convicted contemporary <a href="tiparks.html">Timothy Parks</a>.

<p>Subsequent <a href="../../census1800.html#alpa">res</a>ources help fix Alexander's birth date at between 1756 and 1774. In 1800, the census listed an age-appropriate woman and two young boys also as members of his household. Thus, we can expect that he was married and raising a family. His name does not appear to appear in the extant records of early Albany's <a href="../../churches.html">churches</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> and again in 1802, he was one of three newcomers whose personal property was valued under the Pine Street (<a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>) home of <a href="../w/phwillis.html">Philip Willis</a>.

<p>Perhaps he was the Alexander Parks who was listed in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> as a shoemaker on Orange and/or Arbor Hill beginning in 1818 and at least until 1825.


<p>With the above, we have presented what we currently know about Albany resident Alexander Parks. With essential <a href="../qqqq.html">questions</a> still outstanding, we move on for now. </p>
