<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Pruyn</b></a> was born in June 1709. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="jopruyn3555.html">Johannes</a> and <a href="../s/amsanders1420.html">Ameila Sanders</a> Pruyn.</p>

<p>As a young man, he was called "Johannes Pruyn, Jr." He served as constable in the third ward in 1734 and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> there in 1748. His father died in 1749. The name of "joannes Pruin" appeared on a list of Albany freeholders in 
<a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3556">1763</a>.</p>


<p>Johannes Pruyn. Jr. does not appear to have married. But, in 1755, the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5RsXAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA99&dq=%22abraham+kip&lr=#v=onepage&q=%22abraham%20kip&f=false">will</a> of his brother-in-law - Abraham Kip of Rhinebeck, asked Johannes to take Kip's children into Pruyn's home and to raise them.

<p>Johannes Pruyn. Jr. filed his own <a href="../../wills/willjopruyn3556.html">will</a> in February 1786. He died within a few weeks and was buried from the Albany church. He had lived seventy-eight years. His sister, Alida Logan, <a href="../k/amkip.html">Amelia Kip</a> (Wynants),and Jacob Kip were named as his heirs. The will passed probate in January 1788.</p>
