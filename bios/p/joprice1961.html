<P><a href="#sources"><b>John Price</b></a> was an officer in the <a href="../../garrison.html">garrison</a> at the Albany fort during the first part of the eighteenth century. In 1732, he was deceased but was identified as "late of Albany!"</p>


<p>In 1711, provincial <a href="../../sources.html#sh">military records</a> identified "Mr. Price" as a lieutenant who had been sent from Europe for an expedition. In June 1725, he was commissioned lieutenant of fusileers in place of Philip Schuyler who had died.</p>

<p>He was married to Mary - who was a widow by March 1732. They had several children including <a href="maprice8458.html">Mary</a>, Elizabeth, and probably <a href="joprice6447.html">John</a> - who became a prominent Albany resident.</p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of John Price/Prys is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 1961. This sketch is derived chiefly from external records resources. Unlike most other garrison officers who stayed in Albany, his name is absent from the <a href="../../cbr.html">basic community record</a>. At this time, we could find no additional information about this individual among the "John Price" material on the Internet.</p>
