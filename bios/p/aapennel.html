      <P>According to <a href="http://www.geni.com/people/Aaron-Pennell/6000000002318894423">family-based</a> 
        resources, later Albany resident <a href="#sources"> <strong>Aaron Pennel</strong></a> 
        was born in December 1769. He <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA238&lpg=PA238&dq=%22aaron+pennel%22&source=bl&ots=x8zWXS9Srl&sig=iabJSdcIrPq0ZSmNtX5rJUu-pWQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4jHVI6oIemBsQSuy4K4Bg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22aaron%20pennel%22&f=false">was</a> 
        a younger son in the large family of William and Mary <a href="../../res/sp.html">Pennell</a> 
        of Delaware County, Pennsylvania.
      <p>However, an often-used <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=goRAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=%22aaron+pennell%22&source=bl&ots=WoZ5Y_X9rj&sig=wrnZ19rGkFkRX1BxghUHwN_wuvE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=C1DvVL_ZHOy1sAT894LoDw&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBjg8#v=onepage&q=%22aaron%20pennell%22&f=false">antiquarian resource</a> listed him as from <a href="../../yankinv.html">New England</a>. We seek further clarification regarding his 
<a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. Was he a kinsman of the older Albany resident <a href="jepennel.html">Jeremiah Pennel</a>?

<p>Unless subsequent death reporting is incorrect, this individual probably would not have been the disabled soldier who received a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=39oLAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA685&lpg=PA685&dq=%22aaron+pennel%22&source=bl&ots=IvRNsd2Tyy&sig=NFcsJu2xnnX6nwYkn7P1YOYme6o&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4jHVI6oIemBsQSuy4K4Bg&ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=%22aaron%20pennel%22&f=false">pension</a> in March 1782 in Pennsylvania. Other military <a href="http://www.mocavo.com/State-of-the-Accounts-of-the-County-Lieutenants-During-the-War-of-the-Revolution-1777-1789-Volume-2/234372/667">accounts</a> for earlier services also (but not definitely) would have been for a same named contemporary.

      <p>More likely it was this Aaron Pennel who was among those Albany "<a href="../../econ/comec.html#mer">bus</a>inessmen" 
        who utilized the processing resources of the nearby <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a>. 
        In October 1793 and September 1794, his substantial accounts relating 
        to milling wheat, nailing, and coopering were noted in the chronological 
        account books within the <a href="http://www.nysl.nysed.gov/msscfa/sc7079.htm">Van 
        Rensselaer Manor Records.</a> 
      <p>The Albany paper reported that Aaron Pennel <a href="../../doc/nn2.html#aape">died</a> on October 28, 1794 and was <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IJJPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA238&lpg=PA238&dq=%22aaron+pennel%22&source=bl&ots=x8zWXS9Srl&sig=iabJSdcIrPq0ZSmNtX5rJUu-pWQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=r4jHVI6oIemBsQSuy4K4Bg&ved=0CEAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=%22aaron%20pennel%22&f=false">buried</a> from the <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Pres</a>byterian church. The notice stated that he was 25 years old, had lived in Albany for five years, and had "sustained the character of an amiable and honest man."  </p>
