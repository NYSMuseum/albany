<P>Englishman <a href="#sources"><b>Bartholomew Pickard</b></a> was a soldier in a company on duty at the <a href="../../loc/fortalbany.html">fort</a> in Albany during the 1690s.</p>


<p>He was born in 1676, the son of Bartholomew and Dorothy Pickard of Leicester, England. By 1698, he had emigrated to New York where he was an enlisted man in Richard Ingoldsby's company of soldiers on <a href="../../garrison.html">duty</a> at Albany and Schenectady. In that year, he married Eva Classz of <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their children were baptized in the Reformed churches of Albany and Schenectady.</p>

<p>In 1707, he was identified in the Albany city records as a "retailer of strong liquors" and was required to pay six shilling for a liquor license.</p>

      <p>About 1713, he was granted a lot for a farm located along the <a href="../../loc/kingshighway.html">King's 
        Highway</a> - six miles west of Albany. Later, he acquired substantial 
        acreage in the Mohawk Valley at Stone Arabia. 
      <p>Bartholomew Pickard died at Stone Arabia in 1742. Four of his children survived to raise families in the Mohawk Valley!</p>
