<strong>Jacob S. Pruyn</strong></a> was born in June 1765. He was the son of <a href="sapruyn3577.html">Samuel</a> and <a href="../t/cote4862.html">Neeltie Ten Eyck</a> Pruyn. He grew up in a medium-sized family in a trader's home on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a>.

<p>His father died in 1785. In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#wsp">1788</a>, he was identified as the owner of a <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a> home that he shared with his widowed mother. By <a href="../../census1790.html#4862">1790</a>, his mother was identified as the head of that houshold. He seems to have lived there until after his marriage. 

<p>In August 1802, he married thirty-one-year-old Albany native <a href="../r/arroseboom1589.html">Harriet Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced a number of children who were christened in the Albany church where he was a pewholder.

<p>By 1810, he was identified as the head of a <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> household that included himself, Harriet, one child, and a slave. As early as 1784, Jacob was known as a mariner and then as a <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">Hudson River</a> skipper with a residence at 59 <a href="../../streets.html#hudson">Hudson Street</a>.  

<p>In 1819, he freed a slave and still was counted as an Albany resident. At some time after 1820, he left Albany - probably to live in the home of one of his children.

<P>Jacob S. Pruyn died in July 1836 in Lafayette, Onondaga County. He had lived seventy-two years. His widow lived until 1851.</p>
