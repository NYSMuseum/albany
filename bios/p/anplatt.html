<strong>Ananias Platt</strong></a> was born in September 1762. He <a href="http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/PLATT/1999-01/0916761760">was</a> the sixth of seven children of Obadiah and Mary Carll Platt of Huntington, Long Island .

<p>In November 1786, he married Lydia Jacobs. The marriage produced a number of children. While living in Albany, they were members and he was an elder of the Albany <a href="../../presbyterian.html">Presbyterian Church</a>. 


<p>In 1787, he was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=icI1AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq">appointed</a> lieutenant in a Rensselaerswyck-based company of the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.
 

<p>In  1789 and again in1790, the State legislature granted him the exclusive right to operated a stage line between Albany and Lansingburgh. At that time, he was identified on the <a href="../../census1790.html">census</a> as the head of a household in the part of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> that would be known as <a href="http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nyrensse/lansing.htm">Lansingburgh</a>.

<p>During the 1790s, he was a well-known tavern-keeper and stage coach line operator in Lansingburgh. In November 1796, his "valuable property" consisting of ten lots in Lansingburgh were <a href="http://www.newspaperabstracts.com/link.php?id=4928">offered</a> for sale. By the end of the decade, Ananias Platt had relocated to Albany. At one time, he operated a stage line from Albany to Schenectady as well. 

<p>From 1799 to 1801, he owned and operated the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA210&lpg">Tontine Coffee House</a> at 53 <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#anp">1800</a>, his first ward household included seven men and four females in addition to a slave and two free persons of color. A year earlier, his house, wharf, and lot were valued substantially on the city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessment roll</a>.
