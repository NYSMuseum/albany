      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Samuel Pruyn</strong></a> was was born in 
        December 1677. He was the son of French-speaking woodsman <a href="frpruyn.html">Frans

      <p>In February 1704, Samuel married <a href="../b/mabogert6126.html">Maria 
        Bogert</a> at her father's Albany house. By 1723, five children had been 
        christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where 
        both parents were frequent baptism sponsors. 
      <p>Samuel Pruyn was a <a href="../../makers.html#metal">blacksmith</a> who 
        made his <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3576">home</a> in Albany's 
        <a href="../../wards.html#3">third ward</a>. His house on the northeast 
        corner of <a href="../../streets.html#maiden">Maiden Lane</a> and Middle 
        Alley was a well-known landmark. He performed metalwork for a number of 
        customers including the church and city government. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1707">1707</a>, 
        he was appointed firemaster. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1729">1729</a>, 
        1730, and 1731, he was elected alderman for the third ward. In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, 
        he was a member of an Albany militia company. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3576">1720</a> 
        and <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3576">1742</a>, his name appeared 
        on lists of Albany freeholders. 
      <p>He also owned a house and lot on the <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Vosenkil</a> 
        in the second ward. 
      <P>Samuel Pruyn filed a <a href="../../wills/willsapruyn3576.html">will</a> 
        in March 1752. It named his wife and three sons as heirs. He died in June 
        and was buried from his church. The will passed probate in January 1753.
