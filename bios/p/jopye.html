<P>Based on subsequent material, <a href="#sources"> <strong>John Pye</strong></a> was born in England about 1752. He was known locally as "Pye the Englishman." We seek information on his <a href="../../res/origins.html">origins</a> and path to Albany. <a href="../../res/guess.html">P</a>erhaps he came here after 1790. 

<p>His wife was <a href="https://catalog.swem.wm.edu/Record/3397449">said</a> to have been born Elizabeth Nutt.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his lot in the <a href="../../loc/southend.html">South End</a> (in conjunction with "<a href="../h/joham8326.html">John Hammer</a>") was accorded a modest assessment. The next year, his household was configured on the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first</a> ward <a href="../../census1800.html#jopy">census</a> with only an adult couple and one young girl in residence. However, subsequent surveys (including the first three <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a>) have not yielded information on continued city residency.

<p>In April 1800 and 1801, the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#cr">City Records</a> identified him as a "tavern owner." That <a href="../../loc/public.html">establishment</a> was said to have been along the river road in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> and located halfway between Albany and Troy.

<p>In December 1806, the newspaper <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA11&lpg=PA11&dq=%22john+pye%22+watervliet&source=bl&ots=2iKvP1Vt1x&sig=nTMplAV9zTXz9cr3Ba95_3MBGz4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VBCgT4X5Bqfs0gH2gomqAg&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22john%20pye%22%20watervliet&f=false">reported</a> that Robert Johnson attempted to rob Pye's house and was wounded in the neck. The incident and surrounding lore have been chronicled by Josiah Priest in  <i>The robber, or, A narrative of Pye and the highwayman</i>, which was <a href="http://openlibrary.org/books/OL15165329M/The_robber_or_A_narrative_of_Pye_and_the_highwayman">published</a> in Albany in 1836. The book's subtitle: <i>Being a detailed and particular account of an attempted robbery of the inn of John Pye, between the cities of Albany and Troy, N.Y. in 1808, and of the outlaws' final capture and end: as related by Mrs. Pye herself, and others who were most intimately acquainted with the whole tragical affair . . .</i>, explains further. The embellishments of "Penny-post" <a href="../w/wbwinne.html">William B. Winne</a> have been credited with popularizing the <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=35cRAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA382&lpg=PA382&dq=%22john+pye%22+watervliet&source=bl&ots=IIOGElre4E&sig=_Giqk0Vgay2IC1wnwmG_5fLs1aE&hl=en&sa=X&ei=VBCgT4X5Bqfs0gH2gomqAg&ved=0CCsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=%22john%20pye%22%20watervliet&f=false">incident</a>. The story has been reproduced in a number of <a href="http://www.pennypost.org/pdf_files/Early%20Carrier%20Service%20in%20America.pdf">sources</a>.


<p><a href="../s/schuyler.html">S</a>chuyler family neighbor John Pye died in July 1817 and was buried at the <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">Flatts</a>. He had lived for more than 67 years. His widow re-married in 1818. Later, he was re-interred at Albany Rural <a href="http://www.albanyruralcemetery.org/albrurcem/Notable.html#5330">Cemetery</a>. The east gate of the cemetery is nearby the location of his landmark tavern.</p>
