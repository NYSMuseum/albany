<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony S. Van Schaick</b></a> was born about 1681. He was the son of Albany residents <a href="syvschaick3982.html">Sybrant</a> and <a href="../vd/elvdp6249.html">Elizabeth Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick. His father died before 1685 and his mother re-married.</p>


<p>In 1707, he married <a href="../t/antbroeck8.html">Anna Catharina Ten Broeck</a> at her father's Albany house. By 1725, their eight children had been baptized at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.</p>

<p>During the early 1700s, he was <a href="../../res/ts.html">id</a>entified as a <a href="../../trades/glass.html">glazier</a> who lived on what later was <a href="../../sources.html#pfs">called</a> the "South corner of Pearl and State Streets."

<p>In 1720, he probably was <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3935">one</a> of three "Anthony Van Schaicks" whose name appeared on a list of freeholders living in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3935">1742</a>, his name remained on the first ward freeholders' list.
<p>Anthony S. Van Schaick lost his wife in March 1743. He was still alive in November 1750 and mentioned in the <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a> of his mother.</p>
