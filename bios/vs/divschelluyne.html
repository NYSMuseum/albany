<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional sources, 
<a href="#sources">
<strong>Dirck Van Schelluyne</strong></a> was trained at the Hague and admitted to the practice of law in the Netherlands in 1644. He came to New Netherland to serve as Notary about 1650. After about a decade, he settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and Albany.

<p>His wife was Cornelia Van Buren with whom he had three children before 1653. 

<p>Schelluyne had an uneven relationship with Director General Petrus Stuyvesant - who eventually was able to marginalize him and make his office less profitable. In 1656, Dirck purchased a lot on Manhattan. The next year, his property was valued on the New Amsterdam assessment roll.

<p>Within a few years, he moved upriver to serve as secretary of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>. During the early 1660s, he also was a notary in Beverwyck. He was secretary of Albany in 1665 and 1666. <a href="../vi/ajvilp.html">Adrian Van Ilpendam</a> was his successor.

<p>In 1667, the Mohawks awarded him land at <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a> for service to them. He also owned <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> at what became Troy.
  
<p>Dirck Van Schelluyne was last noted in the commmunity records in 1669. He was the patriarch of a small but important early Albany <a href="vschelluyne.html">family</a>.</p>
