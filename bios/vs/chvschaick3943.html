<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Christina Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in February 1727. She was the daughter of childless widower <a href="anvschaick3936.html">Anthony Van Schaick, Jr.</a> and his second wife, <a href="../c/annacuyler367.html">Anna Cuyler</a> Van Schaick. Christina grew up in a large family (Anna bore nine children) in the <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> home on and the Van Schaick Island farm of an Albany businessman and regional landholder.
 
<p>In September 1751, she married <a href="antvschaick3939.html">Anthony G. Van Schaick</a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">some</a>times AVS, Jr.) at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At that time, both partners were identified as single people of Albany. By 1754, the marriage had produced two children. His bible records <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qeZmAAAAMAAJ&pg=SL3-PA265&lpg=SL3-PA265&dq=sept.+21&source=bl&ots=yPzCvuC3MK&sig=zp5joy90HeaVHYKbYb4OSLRpmf0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=ppQDU6qJJ6W-2gWLxIDYCw&ved=0CCYQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&q=sept.%2021&f=false">referred</a> to her as his niece. 

<p>In March 1761, she was among the heirs named in the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtvschaick.html">will</a> of her aged maiden aunt. In September 1764, "Chnotiantie" was named in the <a href="../../wills/willcavschaick4007.html">will</a> filed by another aunt and identified as the wife of Anthony Van Schaick.

<p>These Van Schaicks mostly lived on Van Schaick Island.

<p>Named as the primary heir in the <a href="../../wills/willantvschaick3939.html">will</a> probated on the estate of her husband in 1782, she was <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM00393.html">receiving rents</a> from tenants on Van Schaick Island and was a principal in other business transactions into the 1790s.

<p>A Christina Van Schaick (<a href="../../res/guess.html">prob</a>ably this subject) filed a <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">will</a> in <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM00393.html">1806</a> that noted property in the city of Albany. She was dead by September 1809 when her will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a>. Subsequent <a href="../../wills/willantvschaick3939.html#lit">litigation</a> on the estate of her documents that death date.</p>
