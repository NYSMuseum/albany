<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Nicholas Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in November 1760. He was the eldest son of <a href="stvschaick3981.html">Stephanus</a> and <a href="../b/jabradt4247.html">Jannetje Bradt</a> Van Schaick. He grew up in the smallish household of a first ward carpenter.

<p>Perhaps he was the "Nicholas Van Schaack" who was accorded a <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#4051">land bounty right</a> in conjunction with the Albany <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">militia regiment</a>. Another, same-named contemporary was associated with the Coxsackie regiment. 

<p>This individual appears to not have married (at least within his Albany context). However, his personal property was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4051">valued</a> under the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">assessments</a> of his father's household. His younger <a href="egvschaick4023.html">brother</a> also was considered under their father's holdings but married in 1791 and set up his own household nearby.

<p>In 1788, an <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html#4051">inventory</a> showed that he owed &pound2.7 to the estate of a neighbor.

<p>In <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, his personal property was valued under his father's first ward holdings. By <a href="../../census1800.html#3981">1800</a>, this individual was no longer showned under his father's first ward household. At that time, he would have been about forty years old.

<p>We seek information on the later life and passing of Nicholas Van Schaick of Albany. A number of <a href="http://www.archive.org/stream/dorchesterfamily00swan/dorchesterfamily00swan_djvu.txt">senarios</a> across New York State appear plausible. However, with so many loose ends, we <a href="../staff/sbstmt.html">move on</a> for now.</p>
