<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Tielman Van Schelluyne</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">Ti</a>leman seems to have been a <a href="http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~rclarke/page1/vschell2.htm">traditional family</a> and/or diminutive form or variant of Dirck - the name of an older <a href="divschell6434.html">br</a>other) was born in July 1688. He was the son of <a href="covschell6431.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../v/geervisscher4123.html">Geertje Visscher</a> Van Schelluyne. He grew up in the second ward home of a middling leatherworker who died in 1728. His mother passed on six years later leaving a number of middle aged offspring to share in the family estate.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1713">1713</a>, he was named constable for the second ward. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1719">1719</a>, he was appointed firemaster.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, he was counted among the men of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. 

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> documentation regarding his occupation and sources of <a href="../../econ/comec.html">livlihood</a>. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6443">1742</a>, he joined his brothers on a list of city freeholders in the second ward.

<p>Like his siblings, the distinctively named Tielman does not seem to have married. He was among the surviving siblings named in the <a href="../../wills/willjovschell6441.html">will</a> filed by his younger brother in July 1743. In July 1749, he was among those who witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willevwendell2657.html#will">will</a> of an Albany neighbor.

<p>Probably living under a family umbrella, we have not encountered his name among Albany's stakeholders and only as a witness in the records of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> beyond the notation of his burial in February 1762.</p>
