<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Van Schaick</strong></a> was born about 1679. She was the daughter of <a href="syvschaick3982.html">Sybrant</a> and <a href="../vd/elvdp6249.html">Elizabeth Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick. In 1696, she became a member of the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church,</a> in Albany. Children were mentioned but not named in the <a href="../../wills/willsyvschaick.html">will</a> filed by her ailing father in August 1683. Her father died before 1686 when her mother re-married and subsequently bore more children. Catharina grew up in a large combined family in the first ward <a href="../../census1679.html#3982">home</a> of an Albany tradesman and businessman.

<p>In January 1699, she married <a href="../q/adq2000.html">Adrian Quackenbush</a> at the Albany church. By 1719, nine children had been christened in Albany.

<p>The young couple began to raise their large family in a <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#2000">home</a> in Albany's third ward. However, by 1720, they had relocated to a farm at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> where Adrian died by the early 1730s.

<p>Catharina Van Schaick Quackenbush was dead by 1750 when her aged mother filed her <a href="../../wills/willelvdp.html">will</a>. Catharina's six living children were named as heirs by their grandmother. Several of them became residents of Schaghticoke. </p>
