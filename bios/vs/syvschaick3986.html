<strong>Sybrant Van Schaick, Jr.</strong></a> was born in the summer of 1708 and christened on August first. He was the eldest son of <a href="antvschaick3935.html">Anthony S.</a> and <a href="../t/antbroeck8.html">Anna Catharina Ten Broeck</a> Van Schaick. He grew up in a "<a href="../../trades/glass.html">glazier's</a>" home on Albany's <a href="../../streets.html">main street</a>.   

<p>In March 1735, he married <a href="../r/anroseboom1587.html">Anna Roseboom</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1747, six children had been christened in Albany. 

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1742">1742</a>, he began a long association with the city government when he was appointed firemaster for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. In that year, his name appeared on a list of first ward <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3986">freeholders</a>. His name remained on the Albany freeholders list in <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3986">1763</a>. In 1762 and <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#3986">1764</a>, he joined in petitions signed by Albany merchants regarding the fur trade.  

<p>In 1754, he was chosen as assistant alderman in the first ward - but does not seem to have been seated. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1759">1759</a>, he first was elected alderman for the first ward. He was re-elected several times into the mid-1760s. During that time, he was an active council member and was re-imbursed from the city treasury. In 1763, he paid for a lot on the <a href="../../loc/wout.html">Woutenbergh</a>. In 1772, he was told to remove his fence from the street on <a href="../../loc/gallowshill.html">Gallows Hill</a>.  
<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#83">1756</a>, his home was included on a census of Albany householders. At that time, he was identifed as a "Glazier."

During the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a>, his house on the south side of <a href="../../streets.html#state">State Street</a> was accorded a substantial assessment - placing him near the bottom of the top five percent of the community.

<p>Sybrant Van Schaick, Jr. was last heard from in 1772. After that, his name has not been found on Albany <a href="../../cbr.html">rolls</a>.</p>
