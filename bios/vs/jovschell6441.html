<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Johannes Van Schelluyne</strong></a> was born in June 1693. He was the son of <a href="covschell6431.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../v/geervisscher4123.html">Geertje Visscher</a> Van Schelluyne. One of five surviving children, Johannes grew up in the second ward home of a leatherworker who also operated a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tannery</a> located just outside the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north gate</a>. His father appears to have died in 1728 leaving a widow and several adult but unmarried offspring.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1721">1721</a>, Johannes was named constable for the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6441">1742</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>Perhaps like his siblings, Johannes does not seem to have married.

<p>Albany resident Johannes Van Schelluyne filed his <a href="../../wills/willjovschell6441.html">will</a> in January 1743.  As he named no direct descendants nor a spouse, it left his entire estate to his three brothers and sister. He was buried from the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in October 1746. The will passed probate in December 1746. Johannes had lived for fifty-three years.</p>
