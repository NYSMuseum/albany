<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Dirck Van Schelluyne</strong></a> was born in July 1684. He probably was the eldest son of Albany residents <a href="covschell6431.html">Cornelis 
        Dirckse</a> and <a href="../v/geervisscher4123.html">Geertje Visscher</a> 
        Van Schelluyne. He grew up in a leatherworker's home and (at least in 
        his youth) probably helped work his father's <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">pits</a> 
        in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>in <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">1715</a>, his name appeared on an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> roster  He was named constable for the second ward in 1710 and firemaster in 1715 and 1717. In that year, he sought to purchase land from the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>.

<p>In December 1722, he was thirty-nine when he married thirty-year-old 
        <a href="../vn/mavness984.html">Maria Van Ness</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. She died after bearing two children. In December 1735, Dirck 
        was fifty-one when he re-married. His second wife was Albany native <a href="../r/elroseboom1599.html">Elizabeth 
        Roseboom</a>. His bride was thirty-eight and That union produced only 
        one child. 
      <p>Curiously, he does not seem to have been among the heirs named in the 
        <a href="../../wills/willjovschell6441.html">will</a> filed by a brother 
        in 1743. 
      <p>An Albany mainliner for fifty years, his name appeared on a list of voters 
        in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6434">1742</a>. He was a merchant 
        who lived in the second ward. The census in <a href="../../census1756.html#153">1756</a> 
        noted that he lived in "a good house". 
      <p>Dirck Van Schelluyne died near the end of 1759 and was buried by his 
        church. By that time, his son <a href="covschell5647.html">Cornelis</a>, 
        had taken over his affairs and was left to care for Dirck's widow.</p>
