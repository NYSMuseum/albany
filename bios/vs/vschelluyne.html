<P>Encountered in a wide variety and seemingly endless array of <a href="#name">spellings</a>, the Albany <a href="#sources"><strong>Van Schelluyne</strong></a> family can be traced to the marriage of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> notary <a href="divschelluyne.html">Dirck</a> and Cornelia Van Buren Van Schelluyne. Their descendants represented a consistently small presence in Albany for more than a century.

<p>However, only one Van Schelluyne-named household was listed on the Albany censuses in <a href="../../census1679.html#6431">1679</a> and <a href="../../census1697.html#161">1697</a>.

<p>Shoemaker and tanner <a href="covschell6431.html">Cornelis</a> (1660-1728) and his wife <a href="../v/geervisscher4123.html">Geertruy Visscher</a> Roseboom were mainline Albany residents. He was the sole family member identified on the list of Albany freeholders taken in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6431">1720</a>. Only one of their six <a href="../../wills/willjovschell6441.html">surviving offspring</a> appear to have married nor raised families of their own. However, in <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3739">1742</a>, a noteworthy five Van Schelluynes were named among the Albany freeholders living in the second ward.  First born <a href="divschell6434.html">Dirck</a>, was a prosperous and long-lived fur trader.
 


<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html">1756</a>, three family members were identified as city householders. At that time, the <a href="../../census1756.html#124">house</a> of "Mrs. Scurloin" was occupied by a 
British officer. 

<p>Cornelis Van Schelluyne stood out on the census of householders in <a  href="../../census1790.html#5647">1790</a>. In <a href="../../census1800.html">1800</a> only the household of "<a href="covschell5647.html">Corns Vn Schurleyn</a>" was configured on the city census . In  
<a href="http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/county/albany/18152AlbanyDirectories.txt">1815</a> - one named household (Dirck) was included in the city directory.</p>
