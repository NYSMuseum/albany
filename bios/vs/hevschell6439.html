<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Hester Van Schelluyne</strong></a> was born in July 1686. She was the daughter of <a href="covschell6431.html">Cornelis</a> and <a  href="../v/geervisscher4123.html">Geertruy Visscher</a> Van Schelluyne. She appears to have been the sole surviving female in a mainline second ward family. 

<p>However, like most of her siblings, Hester does not seem to have married but relied on her brothers for support after the passing of their widowed mother in 1734.

<p>In July 1743, she was named as an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willjovschell6441.html">will</a> of her brother. In April 1751, she was among those confirmed as a co-executor.

<p>In July 1754, her "negress Saar" was christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where she also was a baptism sponsor.

<p>Hester Van Schelluyne probably was dead by 1764 when her <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=q_i0_D4waT0C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%22hester+van+schelluyne%22&source=bl&ots=jw7PXAl6cT&sig=SGLM92J3_N0JFQ7E5UFQXnLErEU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=V3CSUZPoAany0wHNyoD4CQ&ved=0CDUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22hester%20van%20schelluyne%22&f=false">seat</a> in pew 39 at the Dutch church was transferred.</p>
