          <P><A href="#biography"><B>Ryckie Van Schaick</B></A> was baptized on 
            January 4, 1741. She was the second daughter of the eight children 
            born to Albany residents <a href="sgvschaick.html">Sybrant</a> 
            and Alida Roseboom Van Schaick. Several siblings became Albany mainstays 
            including her brother, Colonel Goose Van Schaick.</P>

          <P>As the daughter of the city's <a href="../../mayors.html">mayor</a>, she grew up 
            in an advantaged Albany household. An appropriate mate was <a href="../d/pwdouw.html">Peter 
            Winne Douw</a>, whom she married in 1762. Four children were born 
            to the couple between 1764 and 1789.</P>

<p>Over the next four decades, these Douws lived in each of the city's three wards as Peter became a prominent city official. By <a href="../../census1790.html#2165">1790</a>, they had settled into a large house on Market Street and were attended by a number of servants.


<p>Peter W. Douw died after 1800. In 1803, his widow was alone in the house. Ryckie Van Schaick Douw died a few years later in November 1807. She had lived sixty-six years.</p>
