<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Geertruy Van Schoonhoven</strong></a> probably was born prior to 1680. She was a younger child in the family of <a href="../../nnd.html">N</a>ew Netherland pioneers <a href="ghvschoon5887.html">Geurt Hendrickse</a> and <a href="mcvschoon.html">Maria Cornelis</a> Van Schoonhoven.

<p>She grew up in a large family on the varied upriver holdings of a prominent regional agriculturalist who died in 1702. 

<p>In April 1694, Geertruy and two siblings were "accepted" as members of the Albany Dutch church.

<p>She was among the heirs named in the <a href="ghvschoon5887.html#will">will</a> filed by her father in August 1700. Geurt Hendrickse died in 1702.
 
<p>In October 1700, she ("Geertruy Geurtse Schoonhoven") married London-born garrison soldier <a href="../h/wmhunt.html">William Hunt</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. At that time, she was identified as a young person living in Albany. By 1713, the marriage had produced a number of children the last one being christened in New York City in 1713. 

<p>For a time, the couple made their <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#wmhu">home</a> among the garrison-connected enclave residing in Albany's first ward. 

<p>Probably by 1713, they had made their way to New York City where Hunt had become a freeman in 1711.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on the later life and passing of Geertruy Van Schoonhoven "Hunt."</p>
