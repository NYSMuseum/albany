      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Sybrant Van Schaick</strong></a> was born about 1653. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> and his first wife, Geertie Barents Van Schaick. His father was a brewer and land trader in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> and then Albany. In 1668, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">will</a> filed by his father and stepmother.

<p>By the mid-1670s, he had married <a href="../vd/elvdp6249.html">Elizabeth Vanderpoel</a>. By 1685, the marriage had produced four children.

<p>In 1678, his stepmother agreed to sell him half of the <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewery</a> located between what became <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> and the river. In <a href="../../census1679.html#3982">1679</a>, his house was enumerated on the Albany assessment roll.

<p>In August of 1683, Sybrant Van Schaick filed his Dutch language <a href="../../wills/willsyvschaick.html">will</a>. He was dead by June 1686 when his widow re-married. He had lived only thirty years!
