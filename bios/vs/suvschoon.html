<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Susanna Van Schoonhoven</strong></a> was born in April 1731. She was the last of seven children born to the marriage of <a href="jgvschoon5896.html">Jacobus</a> and <a href="../b/susbradt1138.html">Susanna Bradt</a> Van Schoonhoven. She grew up on the family farm at what then was known as the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. Her father, an enterprising landholder, died in 1749 when Susanna was not yet eighteen. Her older brother was Watervliet skipper <a href="dbvschoon5884.html">Dirck B. Van Schoonhoven</a>.
