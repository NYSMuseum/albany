<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit S. Van Schaick</b></a> was born early in 1685. He was the last child born to <a href="syvschaick3982.html">Sybrant</a> and <a href="../vd/elvdp6249.html">Elizabeth Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick. His father died when Gerrit was one and his mother quickly re-married. Gerrit grew up in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> as a member of a large <a href="../../census1697.html#040">combined</a> family.

<p>In October 1705, he married Albany native <a href="../g/sagoewy5208.html">Sara Goewy</a> in New York City. For much of the next two decades, this family resided in Albany. By 1723, nine children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>.

  
<p>A prominent <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#3952">resident</a> of the third ward, Gerrit belonged to the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> and was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County in 1719. Although he compiled a list of city and county freeholders in <a href="../../lists/list1720.html">1720</a>, his name did not appear on that list.

<p>By 1722, he had begun to acquire land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a>. Perhaps he moved there about the time of the death of his wife following the birth of their last child in 1723.

<p>In 1749, he was named one of the justices of the Albany County court of common pleas. In 1765, he testified that he was about eighty years old when verified the handwriting of his <a href="govs3956.html">brother</a> in a proceeding concerning the so-called will of <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html">Joachim Staats</a>.
