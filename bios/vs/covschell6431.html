<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Van Schelluyne</strong></a> probably was born about 1660. He was the son of New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneers</a> Dirck and Cornelia Van Buren Van Schelluyne.


<p>By the 1680s, he had married Albany native <a href="../v/geervisscher4123.html">Geertje Visscher</a>. By 1698, six children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member and occasional baptism sponsor. 

<p>Cornelis and Geertje set up their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. From <a href="../../census1679.html#6431">1679</a> on, they were prominent community residents. In <a href="../../census1697.html#161">1697</a>, his house included five children. Two years later, he joined his neighbors in <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#6431">swearing</a> allegiance to the king of England. Subsequent <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a> valued his property at a <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html#6431">moderate</a> rate. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#6431">1720</a>, his name was included on a list of qualified voters in the second ward. Cornelis was a shoemaker and <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tannery</a> owner who held additional lots in Albany. The tannery was located <a href="../../loc/northend.html">outside</a> the north gate - probably along Foxes Creek. He served as tax collector and <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> in the second ward. 

<p>Cornelis Van Schelluyne died in May 1728 and was buried from the Albany church.
