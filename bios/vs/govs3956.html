<P><a href="#sources"><b>Gosen S. Van Schaick</b></a> was born in January 1677. He was the son of first generation Americans <a href="syvschaick3982.html">Sybrant</a> and <a href="../vd/elvdp6249.html">Elizabeth Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick.</p>

<p>In December 1699, he married <a href="../s/castaats4574.html">Catharina Staats</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1719, their nine children were christened at the Albany church.</p>

<p>In his early days, he pursued the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a> and was in trouble with the authorities for illegal trading in Canada. But, following his marriage, he settled in Albany and was a businessman and landholder who lived north of the Dutch church in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>. He served on Albany juries and was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> first in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1714">1714</a>. His first ward property on <a href="#property">Market Street</a> was valued on city <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1702tl">assessment rolls</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3956">1720</a>, his name appeared on a list of qualified voters. He also captained an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.</p>

<p>Gosen S. Van Schaick died in March 1725. He had just passed his forty-eighth birthday. His widow lived for three decades longer. Their <a href="sgvschaick.html">son</a> was appointed mayor of Albany in 1756. </p>

<a name=sources><B>Sources:</B> The life of Gosen S. <a href="vschaick.html">Van Schaick</a> is CAP <a href="../../db.html">biography number</a> 3956. This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from family and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>.

<p><a name=property>Although his landmark home was on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> and what became Exchange Street (Mark Lane), it was considered to be in the first ward. Later, another <a href="gvs.html">Goose Van Schaick</a> occupied that location.
