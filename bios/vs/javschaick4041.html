<strong>Jacob A. Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in March 1718. He was the son of <a href="antvschaick3935.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../t/antbroeck8.html">Anna Catharina Ten Broeck</a> Van Schaick. He grew up as a middle child in a landmark house in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a>.

<p>In September 1751, he was thirty-three when he married Albany native <a href="../c/cacuyler373.html">Catharina Cuyler</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1767, the marriage had produced four children who were christened at the Albany church where he was a member and pewholder. By 1777, Catharina was dead and he had re-married, this time to one Elizabeth Van Schaick. Their daughter, Catharina, was born in 1778. 

<p>He was a mainline <a href="../../census1756.html#251">merchant</a> who first lived in the first ward. Like many of his kin, he was <a href="../../lists/list1764.html#4041">identified</a> with those still engaged in the <a href="../../furtrade.html">fur trade</a>.  Later in the 1750s, he relocated to the third ward - taking up residence on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> where he lived until his death. Property <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessments</a> for the second half of the century placed his Albany holdings in the community's top ten percent.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1744">1744</a>, he was named firemaster for the first ward. Ten years later, he was <a href="../../org/cc.html#1754">elected</a> assistant alderman and re-elected again the year following. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1759">1759</a>, he was elected assistant alderman for the third ward and re-elected the next two years. In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1766">1766</a>, he was elected alderman for the third ward. In addition, he was appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany in <a href="../../org/cc.html#1758">1758</a> and served thru 1760.

<p>During the period 1765-85, he was an active trader on the Albany <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market - buying, selling, and leasing lots and grounds along the river and on <a href="../../loc/foxescreek.html">Foxes Creek</a>. He also was interested in lands at <a href="../../na/forthunter.html"><i>Tionnderogge</i></a>.

<p>Jacob A. Van Schaick was an active businessman for many decades. In 1784, hie issued a catalogue of articles he offered for sale at his store on "Water Street" near Middle Dock. He  filed a <a href="../../wills/willjavschaick4041.html">will</a> in December 1787. It mentioned his wife, Elizabeth, and six living children. Probate documents included a very <a href="../../wills/willjavschaick4041.html#inv">extensive inventory</a> of his estate. The will passed probate a month later. This Albany resident had lived almost seventy years.</p>
