<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Van Santvoort</b></a> was born in May 1749. She was the first child born to Albany gunsmith Staats  Van Santvoort and his wife, the former  Willemptie Bradt.</p>


<p>In July 1767, she married newcomer <a href="../d/jadole7874.html">James Dole</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced a number of children - one of them baptized in 1768.  She was a pewholder and occasional sponsor at the church. Her grandfather was the Reformed minister at <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> during the first half of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>James Dole and his wife lived on Albany's <a href="../vv/ravvlk1399.html#southside">Southside</a> where he had a grocery and drygoods store opposite <a href="../c/ricartwright6508.html">Richard Cartwright's</a> inn and tavern. These Dole's prospered until the outbreak of <a href="../../or/or-be.html">hostilities</a> in 1775. Dole was a <a href="../../friends.html">loyalist</a> and was arrested, imprisoned, and ultimately banished from Albany. Anna apparently followed him to New York as, in November 1778, the Governor <a href="../../sources.html#cp">denied</a> her petition to return to Albany.</p>

<p>These Doles were among those who sought refuge in Shelburne, Nova Scotia immediately after the war. But, by the late 1780s, they did <a href="../../census1790.html#7874">return</a> to Albany where James advertized the sale of fish and groceries at his Green Street store in the <a href="../../ag.html"><i>Albany Gazette</i></a> as he had in pre-war days.</P> 

<p>Anna lost her husband in August 1803. In 1810, she was identified as the head of a household at 17 <a href="../../streets.html#beaver">Beaver Street</a> that also included a young family. The widow Ann Dole was listed in <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directories</a> at a number of Southside locations for many years.</p>

<p>Anna Van Santvoort Dole died in December 1833 at the age of eighty-five. She was buried from her residence then at 64 Lydius Street.</p>
