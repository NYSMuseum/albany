<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony Van Schaick</b></a> was born about 1655. 
        He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers 
        <a href="ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> and his first wife, Geertje 
        B. <a href="vschaick.html">Van Schaick</a>. His mother died shortly after 
        his birth and his father soon remarried. In 1668, he was named in the <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">will</a> filed by his father and was said to have been thirteen years old.</p>
		
      <p>About 1678, he married <a href="../vd/mavdp6263.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a>. 
        By 1702, eight of their children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where he was a church officer and occasional baptism sponsor.</p>
      <p>Anthony Van Schaick built on the successes of his father and father-in-law. 
        His name first appeared on the Albany householder assessment rolls in 
        <a href="../../census1679.html#3934">1679</a>. He was a businessman and 
        developed the assets of extensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Schaick_Island">farmlands</a> 
        (including at least two fertile islands in the Hudson River). A few years 
        later, he lived "outside the North gate." In <a href="../../census1697.html#101">1697</a>, 
        his Albany house was on the south side of State Street. In <a href="../../lists/list1699.html#3934">1699</a>, 
        he joined his neighbors in swearing allegiance to the King of England. 
        In <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3934">1720</a>, he was listed as 
        a first ward freeholder. </p>
      <p>He served the community first as an assessor and juror. In 1710, he was 
        elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant</a> alderman for the 
        first ward. By that time, he was among the wealthiest Albany merchant-landowners.</p>

<p>Anthony Van Schaick filed a <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">will</a> in January of 1737. It stated that he was sick. Noted were his wife and four living children. The will listed his Albany property, a farm and orchard on Anthony's Island located nine or ten miles north of Albany, and also ownership of two other islands. He died shortly thereafter and was buried from the Albany Dutch church on February 2. </p>
