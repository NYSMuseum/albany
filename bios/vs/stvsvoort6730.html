      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Staats Van Santvoort</b></a> was born about 1720. 
        He was the son of Cornelis and Anna Staats Van Santvoort. Probably born 
        on Staten Island, he grew up in <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> 
        where his father took their family upon becoming <a href="../../drc.html#domine">domine</a> of the Dutch 
        church there in 1720.</p>
      <p>In December 1747, he married the older <a href="../b/wibradt4367.html">Willempie 
        Bradt</a> of Albany. By 1760, their six children were baptized in the 
        Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were 
        frequent baptism sponsors.</p>
      <p>Staats Van Santvoort was a well-known <a href="../../census1756.html#222">gunsmith</a> 
        who worked from his <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home and 
        also held property along <a href="../../streets.html#lydius">Lydius</a> 
        Street, in Schenectady, and in <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. 
        He repaired weapons for the Albany government, <a href="../j/swj.html">William 
        Johnson</a>, and other clients as well. He twice served as <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> 
        for the first ward. 
		
<p>He was called on to witness <a href="../../wills/willmgtbleecker212.html">wills</a> and post bonds. In July 1758, he received letters of administration on the estate of <a href="../l/rlottridge453.html">Robert Lottridge</a>. In December <a href="../../wills/willdibradt3084.html">1763</a>, he was named co-executor of a neighbor. During those years, he also was known as a slaveowner.
		 
<p>In April 1769, he was identified as a blacksmith of <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a> when he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willbarvisscher.html">will</a> of an Albany trader. 

<p>In November 1778, he was <a href="../../doc/1778ae.html">exempted</a> from military service due to his age.

<p>By the 1780s, he had moved his base to Halfmoon. In 1790, his household with two women and three slaves was configured on the <a href="../../census1790.html#6730">census</a> for Watervliet. He probabaly died during the 1790s.</p>
