<!-- Start Main Content -->
<P>According to <a href="../../res/ts.html">traditional sources</a>, 
<a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Van Schie</strong></a> was born in the Netherlands during the early 1700s (perhaps in 1703).

<p>In June 1731, he was identified as a ministerial candidate from Leyden when he was called by the elders of the Pougkeepsie and Fishkill Reformed church.

<p>In September 1732, he arrived in New York with his wife, Josina Prys (Price). By the end of the year, he had left Fishkill to serve as an assistant under the wide-ranging pastorate of  <a href="../vd/pevdriessen6692.html">Petrus Van Driessen</a> at the <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> in Albany. He succeeded as domine following Van Driessen's death early in 1738.

<p>Between 1734 and 1739, four of his children were buried from his Albany church.

<p>For more than a decade, he ministered to his Albany congregation, to non member Albany residents, and to those of greater <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Albany County</a> as well.

<P>Cornelis Van Schie died in August 1744 and was buried from his Albany church. He had lived forty-one years. His widow left Albany two years later.</p>
