<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in September 1690 and christened at the Dutch church in New York. She was the daughter of <a href="antvschaick3934.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdp6263.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick. She grew up with a large family in the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> home of a prominent businessman and landholder.

<p>In December 1724, Catharina married a much older <a href="../c/sacoeymans.html">Samuel Coeymans</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. The marriage produced no children as her husband was in his fifties at the time of the marriage.

<p>In January 1737, she was among the heirs <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">named</a> to share in the extensive estate of her father.

<p>The couple lived for most of their marriage on the "Coeymans Patent" in the substantial riverside home they shared with Samuel's <a href="../vp/davplanck.html">married</a> but also childless sister.

<p>Samuel Coeymans died in 1754 leaving his wife well-provided for in his <a href="../../wills/willsacoeymans.html">will</a>.

<p>Widow Catharina may have lived in Albany itself as the widow identified on a census of householders made by the British army in <a href="../../census1756.html#87">1756</a>. However, her extensive holdings in south Albany stood out on the <a href="../../sources.html#uny">1760s</a> tax rolls as well.

<p>Catharina Van Schaick Coeymans filed a <a href="../../wills/willcavschaick4007.html">will</a> in September 1763. Following the <a href="../../wills/willsacoeymans.html">path</a> set by her husband a decade earlier, her estate went to Ten Eyck and Van Schaick kin. The will passed probate in June 1771.</p>
