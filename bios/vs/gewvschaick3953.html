      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Gerrit W. Van Schaick</b></a> was born in May 1758. 
        He was the last child born to Albany merchant <a href="wevschaick3990.html">Wessel 
        Van Schaick</a> and his wife, the former <a href="../g/magerr6009.html">Mary 
        Gerritse</a>. He grew up in a comfortable home near the Albany waterfront. 
        Three siblings ultimately became Albany residents. He mostly was known 
        as "Gerrit W." to prevent confusion with at least two other <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#275">same-named</a> 
        contemporaries.</p>
      <p>Coming of age during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">war</a>, he marched 
        with the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> to defend Saratoga 
        in 1777. In 1779, he served as an ensign in Captain John Price's militia 
        company. Later, he was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty 
        right</a>. He ultimately rose to the rank of General in the New York State 
        militia.</p>

<p>Gerrit W. Van Schaick probably did not marry and <a href="../../census1790.html#6009">lived with his mother</a> following the death of his father in 1783. With her passing in 1797, the <a href="../../wills/willwevschaick.html"> inherited</a> a share in Maria and Wessel's substantial estate. He was a member and pewholder of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 

<p>He owned extensive Albany real estate including a wharf and other waterfront 
        holdings, a large tract along Foxes Creek, and land on the east side of 
        Pearl Street. In August <a href="../../doc/fire1797.html#mont">1797</a>, 
        his house and stable on Montgomery Street were destroyed in a great fire. 
        At that time, <a href="../b/isbogert6106.html">Isaac Bogert</a> was 
        living in the dwellinghouse. He also held certificates for several thousand 
        acres in central New York. After the death of his mother, he had the Foxes 
        Creek property <a href="../../inprog.html">subdivided</a> and began to 
        sell off the lots north of the stream bed in a new area known as <a href="../../loc/arborhill.html">Arbor Hill</a>.</p>
      <p>He lived on lower State Street (number 23 State) and was the first cashier 
        of the <a href="../../bankofalbany.html">Bank of Albany</a>. Along those 
        lines, he <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3AVan+Schaick%2C+Gerrit+W.%2C&qt=hot_author">produced</a> 
        a number of practical publications - chiefly relating to banking. This 
        bachelor was involved with and a supporter of a number of community-based organizations.

<p>Without children, his household and businesses were cared for by slaves and servants. In <a href="../../census1800.html#3953">1800</a>, his household was served by four slaves. In May <a href="http://digitalmetro.cdmhost.com/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/p15052coll5/id/23285/rv/compoundobject/cpd/23287/rec/1">1814</a>, 
        he was identified as an Albany resident when he purchased a twenty-two-year-old 
        "Negro man" named Robert Harrison from John <a href="../r/joroff1026.html">J.</a> 
        Roff of "the Colonie."</p>
      <p>Gerrit W. Van Schaick <a href="#obit">died</a> in <a href="../../na/lburgh.html">Lansingburgh</a> 
        in December 1816 after a short illness. He had lived fifty-eight years. 
        Recognizing the family ownership of land there, Van Schaick Street (today's 
        Monroe Street in "the Burgh") probably was named for him.</p>

      <p><a name=obit></a><b>Obituary:</b> "Gerrit W. Van Schaick died at Lansingburgh, 
        after a short but severe illness, age 59. He was the first cashier of 
        the Bank of Albany, which office he held from 1792 to 1814. He was one 
        of the citizen soldiers who rallied to the battle-field when the city 
        was threatened by the British under Burgoyne; was afterwards a general 
        in the militia, and an efficient member of the common council." From "Notes 
        from the Newspapers," printed in <a href="../../sources.html#aa"><i>Annals 
        of Albany</i></a>, volume 6, p . 119.</p>
