            <P><A  href="#biography"><B>Jacobus G. Van Schoonhoven</B></A> was 
              born in Albany, the eldest son of carpenter/farmer <a href="ghvschoon5887.html">Geurt 
              Hendrickse</a> and <a href="mcvschoon.html">Maria Cornelis</a> Van 
              Schoonhoven. Growing up on his father's farms on the <a href="../../albanycounty.html">Upper 
              Hudson</a>, the <a href="../../census1697.html#060">census of 1697</a> 
              noted that he was living alone in an Albany house next to that of 
              his parents.</p>
            <p>His Albany property was referenced in a <a href="../../wills/willwgvdb5641.html">will</a> 
              filed by a neighbor in 1714. 
            <p>In 1714, he married Albany native <a href="../b/susbradt1138.html">Susanna 
              Bradt</a> - the mother of their <a href="vschoonfm.html">seven children</a>. 
              In 1702, he was named a constable for the Half Moon. Over the next 
              decades, he relocated to <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Half Moon</a> 
              (freeholder there in <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html#1720">1720</a>) 
              and held land at <a href="../../na/sgtke.html">Schaghticoke</a> 
              as well. During the 1720s, he was operating a sawmill at Tomhannock.</p>
            <p>Like most of his neighbors, Jacobus served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">Albany 
              County Militia</a>. However, his commitment to homefront defense 
              was stronger than most as he was a lieutenant in a ranger company 
              in 1703. In <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=pPA5AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA465&lpg=PA465&dq=%22corset+veder%22&source=bl&ots=rM7vylFnve&sig=5483I5t5nKy9PxMEwldqv3zeXTU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=sr3sU8qaFYzhoATPwoDgDg&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22corset%20veder%22&f=false">1715</a>, 
              he was captain of the militia company drawn from Niskayuna and Halfmoon. 
              A captain needed to be a man of means as he was responsible for 
              raising and outfitting his company. Then his expenses could be reimbursed.</p>
            <p> Jacob G. Van Schoonhoven's death on January 24, 1749 was recorded 
              in his <a href="dbvschoon5884.html">son</a>'s bible. Two days later, 
              he was buried from the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Reformed 
              Church</a> where he had been a member for more than fifty years.</p>
