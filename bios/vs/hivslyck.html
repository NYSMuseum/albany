<P><a href="#sources"><b>Hilletie Van Slyck</b></a> was born in the Mohawk Valley during the mid seventeenth century. She was the daughter of frontier <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a> Cornelis A. Van Slyck and a Mohawk woman. She was raised by her 
        mother and <a href="../../art/danckaerts.html">lived</a> among the Indians.</p>

<p>By the 1670s, she was the wife of Albany businessman and regional property 
        holder <a href="../vo/pdvolinda.html">Pieter Danielse Van Olinda</a> and 
        the mother of several of his children.</p>

<p>Well known in the country west of Albany, Hilletie's special talent was 
        that of the interpreter. In 1667, she is said to have been given five 
        islands in the Mohawk at <a href="../../na/niskayuna.html">Niskayuna</a> 
        in payment for her services. During the early 1700s, she was paid a salary 
        by the provincial government as the "interpretess to the Indians at Albany."</p>
      <p>She was able to secure a number of parcels of land in the region as a 
        result of her work as interpreter. A number of visitors mentioned her 
        in their narratives. Chief among them was the missionary <a href="../../art/danckaerts.html">Jasper 
        Danckaerts</a> who <a href="../../art/danckaerts.html#201.8">wrote extensively</a> 
        about Hilletie's life and character.</p>
      <p>Hilletie Van Slyck Van Olinda died in February 1707.</p>
