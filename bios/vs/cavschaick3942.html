<P><a href="#sources"><b>Catharina Van Schaick</b></a> was born in August 1752. <a href="#portrait"><img src="../../images/jpg/cavschaick.jpg" align=right width=200 height=260  border=1 vspace=4 hspace=4"></a> She was the  last daughter born to Albany residents <a href="wevschaick3990.html">Wessel</a> and <a href="../g/magerr6009.html">Maria Gerritse</a> Van Schaick. She grew up in a comfortable riverfront home and was educated to become a fitting mate for a son of Albany's commercial elite.</p>


<p>After a courtship that included the exchange of letters during the darkest days of the Revolutionary <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a>, in January 1778 Caty was almost twenty-six when she married army officer <a href="../g/pegans.html">Peter Gansevoort</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1790, their six children had been baptized there.</p>

<p>The early years of their marriage including the hardships of wartime separations have been described by Alice Kenney in <a href="../../books.html#apkgans"><i>The Gansevoorts of Albany</i></a>.</p> 
<p>In 1782, she was <a href="../../wills/willwevschaick.html">bequeathed</a> a share of her father's estate.
 
<p>After the war, Peter Gansevoort established himself as a leading businessman from his headquarters at the family seat on <a href="../../im/imemarket.html">Market Street</a>. These Gansevoorts were <a href="../../census1790.html#91">well-known</a> residents of 58 Market Street across from the <a href="../../loc/markethouse.html">Market House</a> for the next thirty years.</p>

<p>Following a lengthy illness, Catharina lost her husband during the summer of 1812. The Widow Catharine Gansevoort lived on in their landmark home until December 1830 when she died at age seventy-nine. Her daughter, Maria, was the mother of American literary icon Herman Melville.</p>
