<p><b>Maria Cornelis</b> was the wife of <a href="ghvschoon5887.html">Geurt Hendrickse</a> and the matriarch of the Albany <a href="../vs/vschoon.html">Van Schoonhoven family</a>.</p>

<p>Like her husband, she probably was born in Europe. However, it appears that all of her children were born in America. She lived with Geurt Hendrickse in <a href="../../census1697.html#060">Albany</a> and in his other up-river residences. She was a member of the Albany Dutch Church where she witnessed the baptism of a granddaughter as late as 1704.</p>

        <p>She was called "my well beloved wife Marite Cornelius" in her husband's will 
          dated 1700 and was made executor of his estate. Her <a href="vschoonfm.html">six 
          surviving children</a> were named in that document as well.</p>

<p>She received all of Geurt Hendrickse's property at Halfmoon and his lot in Albany upon his death in 1702. Maria Cornelis Van Schoonhoven may have died after 1710.</p>
