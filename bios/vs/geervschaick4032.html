      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Geertje Van Schaick</b></a> was born about 1650. 
        She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers 
        <a href="ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> and his first wife Geertje 
        Brants Van Schaick. By 1657, her mother had died and her father re-married. 
        She was raised in a large combined family in Albany and its environs.</p>
      <p>By 1668, she had married <a href="../c/hecoster5974.html">Hendrick Coster</a>. 
        Her father's <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">will</a> filed in 
        that year stated that she was an eighteen-year-old bride and, at that 
        time, was in Holland. Before Coster's death in 1678, the marriage had 
        produced at least three Coster children. Her second husband was fur trader 
        <a href="../l/jolansing3440.html">Jan Lansing</a> - the father of six 
        children who were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a> where both parents were members and baptism sponsors.</p>
      <p>These Lansings lived on <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> 
        and were prominent members of Albany's <a href="../../econ/comec.html">business 
        community</a>.</p>
      <p>Jan Lansing died in 1728. Geertje Van Schaick Coster Lansing lived until 
        December 1738. At that time, she was in her eighty-ninth year!</p>
