<strong>Gerrit Van Schaick</strong></a> probably was born during the first half of the seventeenth century. He was the Albany-born son of New Netherland pioneers <a href="ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> and Geertje Brants Van Schaick.


<p>His wife was <a href="alvslicht.html">Alida Van Slichtenhorst</a>. Perhaps they married in 1678. The marriage appears to have been childless.

<p>In March <a href="../../census1679.html#3951">1679</a>, his name was included on a census of Albany householders who were assessed for funds to repair the stockade. At that <a href="../../res/ts.html">time</a> he owned a house near <a href="../../im/im1686.html">Market</a> and Columbia Streets. 

<p>He filed a joint <a href="../../wills/willgevschaick.html">will</a> with his wife in November 1679. It named Alida as his direct heir and then mentioned his nieces and nephews.

<p>However, Gerrit Van Schaick was dead by May 1681 when the will passed probate and noted that his widow had re-married.</p>
