      <P><a href="#sources"><strong>Nicholas Van Schaick</strong></a> was born 
        in July 1701. He was the son of Dominicus and <a href="../g/regroesbeck3375.html">Rebecca 
        Groesbeck</a> Van Schaick. He grew up in his father's house in <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a>. 
      <p>In February 1728, he married <a href="../w/dowitbeck1720.html">Dorothea 
        Witbeck</a> - a thirty-year-old spinster who was pregnant with their first 
        child. By 1736, four children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>These Van Schaicks made their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first 
        ward</a>. In 1730, Nicholas was appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a>. 
        His name appeared on the list of <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3978" title="link to Freeholders list for 1742">freeholders</a> 
        in 1742. In December 1748, city records <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gZQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA135&lpg=PA135&dq=%22nicholas+van+schake%22+albany&source=bl&ots=sunV7u95Pl&sig=jQ210qzVgeIgib6IyxKoKRe47V4&hl=en&sa=X&ei=jX7ZUbjIEOmR0QGgk4GgDw&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22nicholas%20van%20schake%22%20albany&f=false">showed</a> 
        that he had agreed to supply shot and powder to blockhouse #7. 
      <p>Dorothea died in June 1740 at the age of forty-two. Even though his family 
        had several small children, Nicholas Van Schaick does not appear to have 
        re-married. He died in September 1750 at the age of forty-eight.</p>
