      <P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Gosen Van Schaick</strong></a> was christened 
        at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> on June 4, 1735. 
        He was the first and only child born to the marriage of slooper and landholder 
        <a href="gvs3959.html">Goose Van Schaick</a> and his second wife and cousin, 
        <a href="devschaick4029.html">Debora Van Schaick</a>. 
      <p>These Van Schaicks owned and had access to substantial resources in Albany and beyond. However, young "Goose" would know his father for only a year.
   
      <p>In July 1736, he was identified as one of three living children in the <a href="../../wills/willgvs3959.html">will</a> 
        filed by his father. The will passed probate in October. Following the 
        passing of his mother, he was to share in that estate. However, widow 
        Catharina <a href="../b/jobeekman3861.html">remarried</a> and "her child" 
        was provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3861.html">will</a> 
        filed by his stepfather in 1756. His mother survived in the 1760s. 
      <p>With so many family members <a href="../../res/sp.html">named</a> in honor of the Van Schaick patriarch, we hesitate to assign qualitative information at this time. However, this "Goose" Van Schaick probably did not raise his own family.</p>
