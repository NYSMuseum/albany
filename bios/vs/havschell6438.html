<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Harmanus Van Schelluyne</strong></a> probably was <a href="#born">born</a> during the 1690s. Based on subsequent information, he would be the son of <a href="covschell6431.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../v/geervisscher4123.html">Geertruy Visscher</a> Van Schelluyne. If so, both parents would have passed on by 1734.

<p>In 1715, his name appeared on the <a href="../../lists/list1715grc.html">roster</a> of an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company.

<p>Perhaps this individual did not marry as no wife has been encountered. He does not appear to have christened children in Albany <a href="../../churches.html">ch</a>urches. 

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#6438">1742</a>, his name appeared (along with his three brothers) on a list of freeholders living in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>.

<p>In January <a href="../../wills/willjovschell6441.html">1743</a>, he was named in the Dutch language will filed by his brother.

<p>In <a href="../../census1756.html#9">1756</a>, he was identified as a shoemaker (the trade of his father) and <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sk</a>ipper on the census of Albany householders taken by the British army.

<p>Harmanus Van Schelluyne was buried from the Albany Dutch church in September 1761.</p>
