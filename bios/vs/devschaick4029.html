<P><a href="#sources"><b>Debora Van Schaick</b></a> was born in May 1707. she was the daughter of <a href="govs3956.html">Gosen</a> and <a href="../s/castaats4574.html">Catharina Staats</a> Van Schaick. Her father was an Albany mainstay whose death in 1725 at age forty-eight left a void in her <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market Street</a> home. Her mother lived another three decades as a widow and called on maturing Debora to care for their large family.</p>

<p>In August 1734, she was twenty-seven when she married widower <a href="gvs3959.html">Gosen Van Schaick</a>. Their son was born a year later. He died in 1736 - <a href="../../wills/willgvs3959.html">leaving her</a> the bulk of her estate but also instructions on care of his soon-to-be fatherless children. Debora soon married again. Her second  husband was <a href="../b/jobeekman3861.html">John Beekman</a> - another widower with several small children.</p>

<p>These Beekmans lived in the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a> where John was a trader and civic leader. She was 
named heir and co-executor in the <a href="../../wills/willjobeekman3861.html">will</a> filed by her "sick" husband in May 1756. She was a widow again in 1759 when his will passed probate. Over her life she was left bequests in the wills of several relatives.</p>
  
<p>Debora Van Schaick was alive in 1765 when she was deposed in an inquiry concerning the will  of one of her father's <a href="../s/jostaats4558.html">contemporaries</a>.</p>
