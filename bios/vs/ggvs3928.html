<strong>Goosen Gerritse</strong></a> (<a href="../../res/sp.html">occ</a>asionally Gosen Gerritsz) was born in Utrecht during the first quarter of the seventeenth century. He came to New Netherland in 1637 under contract with the Van Rensselaers. Over the next decades, other family members followed. As a result of two marriages, he was the patriarch of a large family that became prominent in Albany and its hinterland under the name of <a href="vschaick.html">Van Schaick</a>

<p>After more than a decade in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>, Goosen Gerritse gravitated toward the fur trade and was present at the initial distribution of houselots in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> in 1652. Subsequently, he owned several more properties in Beverwyck/Albany and was an active participant in the regional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> market. Additionally, he was a <a href="../../trades/brewer.html">brewer</a> and also was known as a <a href="../../trades/tanner.html">tanner</a>.

<p>His first wife was Geertie Brants Peelen. Following her death, he married <a href="../l/anlievens.html">Anna Lievens</a> in July 1657. By 1668, the second marriage had produced six children.


<p>Headed for Holland, Goosen Gerritse filed a <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">joint will</a> with his wife in May 1668. He called himself the "Commissary in Albany." It left a substantial estate to his second wife and then to his ten living children.

<p>Goosen Gerritse Van Schaick lived for a number of years afterwards and still was entering into <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> transactions as late a <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xZwCAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA114&lpg=PA114&dq=will+%22goosen+gerritse%22&source=bl&ots=zBlYt-SEfO&sig=4YNQueRwhErlkvo4Fg5aSaX_Np4&hl=en&ei=3MuwS_SIN4O88ga5k-ChCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5&ved=0CBAQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=will%20%22goosen%20gerritse%22&f=false">1675</a>. He was dead by 1679 when his widow was identified as the <a href="../../census1679.html">head</a> of their Albany household.

<p>Generations of descendants were <a href="gvs.html">named</a> in his honor!
