<strong>Mary Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in July 1746. she was the eldest daughter of Albany mainstays <a href="wevschaick3990.html">Wessel</a> and <a href="../g/magerr6009.html">Maria Gerrits</a> Van Schaick. She grew up with several siblings in a merchant's <a href="../../census1756.html#255">home</a> in the heart of Albany's riverside business district. 

<p>Mary did not marry and probably lived in her parent's landmark <a href="../../census1790.html#6009">home</a> for her entire life.

<p>Perhaps she was the "Maria Van Schaick" who <a href="http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM00393.html">rented</a> property in Rensselaerswyck for fifteen years to <a href="../r/coruby1056.html">Conrad Ruby</a> in 1785. She seems to have had some sort of public life as her name appeared on a number of Albany <a href="../../wills/willhvdyck832.html#3974">account</a> books. 


<p>In 1782, she was <a href="../../wills/willwevschaick.html">left</a> a share and was named co-executor of the estate of her father. Following Wessel's death the year after, and her mother's passing in 1797, she probably lived with one of her <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=editions:0rqO8ViE9cK8tX#PPA93,M1">prominent brothers</a>.

<p>Mary Van Schaick died in August 1813 and was buried in the church plot. She had lived sixty-seven years.
