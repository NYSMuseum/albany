<P><a href="#sources"><b>Anthony Van Schaick, Jr.</b></a> was born in 1682. He was the eldest son of <a href="antvschaick3934.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdp6263.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick of Albany and <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a>.</p>

<p>This Anthony married twice. His first wife (married in December 1707 at the house of the bride's parents) was Albany native <a href="../w/suwendell2721.html">Susanna Wendell</a> who died without having a family. In 1712, he married <a href="../c/annacuyler367.html">Anna Cuyler</a>, whose nine children were baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch  church</a> where he was a member and pewholder. </p>

<p>Anthony Jr. set up his home in Albany's first ward where he became an Albany <a href="../../lists/list1720.html#3936">mainstay</a>. In 1715, he belonged to a city-based <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">troop</a> in the Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>.</p>

<p>As the only surviving son of a <a href="../../res/realestate.html">landed</a> businessman, Anthony Jr. was <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">destined to administer</a> the extensive estate of his father which also included a farm on Van Schaick Island.</p>

<p>By the 1720s, he had purchased another lot and moved his Albany residence to <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> near the city stockade. He also made use of the farm upriver on an island in the Hudson and built a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Schaick_Island">grand home</a> on the property.

<p> Anthony Van Schaick, Jr. died in August 1759</p>
