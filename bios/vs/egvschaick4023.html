<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Egbert Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in April 1764. He was the son of <a href="stvschaick3981.html">Stephanus</a> and <a href="../b/jabradt4247.html">Jannetje Bradt</a> Van Schaick. He was a middle child in the smallish family of a first ward carpenter.

<p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1787">1787</a>, he wa appointed chimney viewer for the first ward.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4023">1788</a>, his personal property was assessed under the holdings of his father. However, unlike his father and brother, by <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a>, Egbert's property no longer was valued on city assessment rolls.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#4023">1790</a>, census records showed him living alone in his <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a> home. A decade later, his household was <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/7590/4440898_00102/536531?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3findiv%3d1%26db%3d1800usfedcenancestry%26h%3d536531%26new%3d1&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnRecord">configured</a> on the census for <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html">Bethlehem</a>. At that time, his family consisted of a young boy and girl and their parents. In 1810, the Bethlehem census <a href="../../na/bethlehem.html#sources">charted</a> the arrival of additional children.

<p>In December 1791, he had married <a href="../w/winne.html">Maria Winne</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. At the time of his marriage, Egbert was <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=YIIEAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=%22egbert+van+schaack%22&source=bl&ots=RZ5npIOpnP&sig=5iStbnW2nhtaWAFqOe8xycIStps&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MSXcUYjOE6j84API8YGwCw&ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=%22egbert%20van%20schaack%22&f=false">identified</a> as a merchant. By 1804, five children had been christened in the church where the parents were members and supporters. In May 1802, Egbert's father was buried from their church.  

<p>In <a href="http://interactive.ancestry.com/11656/dvm_PrimSrc000270-00206-0/398?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.com%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3fgst%3d-6&ssrc=&backlabel=ReturnSearchResults&rc=2297,1167,2450,1219;410,1273,637,1326;653,1734,804,1785;801,1733,1061,1786;415,2077,537,2128;2222,2094,2459,2160;417,2194,539,2246;537,2195,814,2248;1648,2205,1808,2257;1892,2325,2054,2376;653,2664,819,2715;2300,3379,2470,3430">1798</a>, Egbert Van Schaick was named second lieutenant in the independent company of artillery for the city of Albany under the command of Captain Charles R. Webster. 

<p>Egbert Van Schaick died in May 1816. His widow returned to Albany and lived on at 60 South Pearl Street until her <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=u5wpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA113&lpg=PA113&dq=%22egbert+van+schaack%22&source=bl&ots=cNrT_KcfPU&sig=QeugDqvdolztS5DXRLInISxWlBg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MSXcUYjOE6j84API8YGwCw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=%22egbert%20van%20schaack%22&f=false">passing</a> in February 1825.</p>
