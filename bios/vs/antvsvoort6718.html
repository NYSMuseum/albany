<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anthony Van Santvoort</strong></a> was born in September 1761. He was the last child born to the marriage of <a href="covsvoort6721.html">Cornelis</a> and <a href="../b/arbradt4210.html">Ariaantie Bradt</a> Van Santvoort. He grew up in the <a href="../../loc/northend.html">North End</a> home of a Hudson River <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">skipper</a>. Named for his maternal grandfather, the Bradts had been long time residents of the flats just north of the city line.

<p>In September 1786, he married Watervliet resident <a href="../r/maroff.html">Maria Roff</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were mainline members and where Anthony later was a member of the <a href="../../org/grconsistory.html">Great Consistory</a>. However, in 1792, an Anthony Van Santvoort was a pewholder at the First <a href="../../lutheran.html">Lutheran church</a> as well. Perhaps that individual also rented a plot of land from the Lutherans near Lodge and Pine Streets. Their marriage produced at least six children before Maria's death in November 1800. In 1806, he is said to have married Rachel <a href="../g/groesbeck.html">Groesbeck</a>. 

<p>These Van Santvoorts made their <a href="../../census1790.html#6718">home</a> just north of Albany in the part of the Manor then called <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. In <a  href="../../census1800.html#6718">1800</a>, his household included three boys and a girl along with the parents.

<p>In 1815, the <a href="../../art/art-jls.html">city directory</a> first identified him as a merchant with an <a href="../../citylimits.html">address</a> of 205 North Market Street. He remained a Watervliet/Albany mainstay at that address for more than thirty years.

<p>His second wife, Rachel, passed away in March 1835 at the age of sixty.

<p>Anthony Van Santvoort died in February 1852, He had lived for 90 years. His epitaph <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=bpcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=%22my+dearest+friends+i+leave+in+tears%22&source=bl&ots=SqbqWMupxl&sig=IS0cWjR96Y1G1fTu4YwCVte6Fag&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LiQ6UejiMIfF0AGFjYCICw&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22my%20dearest%20friends%20i%20leave%20in%20tears%22&f=false">read</a> "My dearest friends I leave in Tears for we shall meet on earth nor more. I trust through grace we'll sweetly meet On Canaan's calm and pleasant shore. He was <a href="http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=84897921">buried</a> alongside his wife at the Albany Rural Cemetery. His will passed <a href="../../guide/histres.html#probate">probate</a> that April. </p>
