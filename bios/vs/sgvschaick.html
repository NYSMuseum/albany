<P><A href="#biography"><B>Sybrant G. Van Schaick</B></A> was born in December 1708. He was the only surviving son of Albany trader and landholder <a href="govs3956.html">Gosen Van Schaick</a> and his wife, Albany native <a href="../s/castaats4574.html">Catharina Staats</a> Van Schaick.</p>

          <p><a href="#sig"><img src="../../images/jpg/sig/sigsgvs.jpg" align=right border=0 hspace=4 vspace=0 width=250 alt="signature of Sybrant G. Van Schaick"></a>Losing 
            his father in 1725, young Sybrant was saddled with early responsibility 
            while most Albany boys were able to come of age under a family umbrella. 
            Surviving the <a href="#stigma">stigma</a> of his father's illegal 
            trading with Canada, he was elected assistant <a href="../../corporation.html">alderman</a> 
            for the first ward in 1731. But <a href="#biography">this</a> Sybrant 
            spent most of his early adulthood following the <a href="../../furtrade.html">Indian trade</a> and managing family property north and south of Albany.</P>

          <P>At age twenty-seven, he married <a href="../r/alroseboom1534.html">Alida Roseboom</a> 
            in 1735. Over the next fifteen years, their seven children were baptized 
            at the Albany Dutch church. By the mid-1740s, these Van Schaicks were 
            established in the family home on <a href="../../streets.html#market">Market 
            Street</a>. In 1744, Sybrant was elected first ward alderman. In the 
            years that followed, a focus on city-based business identified him 
            as an Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#254">mainstay</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1742fl.html#3987">1742</a> and <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3987">1763</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders.</p>  

          <p>The provincial governor commissioned him recorder of the city in 1750. After 
            five years in that <a href="../../loc/cityhall.html">office</a>, in 
            1756 he was appointed <a href="../../mayors.html#sgvs">mayor</a> of 
            Albany. He served during the difficult period of the last <a href="../../7yw.html">French 
            and Indian War</a>. He retired from the mayoralty in 1761.</p>

In the years that followed, this Albany merchant showed renewed interest in managing family real estate and acquired several new parcels beyond Albany as well. In 1758, he was appointed to the county court perhaps signifying that he had relocated to his farm south of Albany.<p></p>

          <P>Calling himself a resident of Coxsackie, Sybrant G. Van Schaick filed a will in June 1772. His <a  href="../r/alroseboom1534.html">wife</a> was 
            dead and he left an extensive estate to his four surviving children. 
            Within two years, he had passed also!</p>
