<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anna Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in October 1722. She was the daughter of <a href="anvschaick3936.html">Anthony Van Schaick, Jr. </a> and his second wife, <a href="../c/annacuyler367.html">Anna Cuyler</a> Van Schaick. She was a middle child in a large and advantaged family but lost her mother in 1741. Her father was a Pearl Street businessman and regional landholder who built a grand mansion on an island just beyond the <a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">Halfmoon</a>. Anthony Van Schaick, Jr. lived until 1759.

<p>In October 1743, Anna married the somewhat older Claverack native <a href="../t/tbroeck.html">Henry Ten Broeck</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1766, nine children had been christened in Allbany, Rhinebeck. Germantown, and Claverack. The couple raised their family on a farm along the Roeloff Jansen Kill. 

<p>In March 1761, Anna was among those named (along with her husband) in the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtvschaick.html">will</a> filed by her maiden aunt. Two years later, she was named again along with Henry in the <a href="../../wills/willcavschaick4007.html">will</a> filed by another aged aunt.

<p>Anna Van Schaick Ten Broeck died at some time following the birth of her last child in 1766. She may have lived to be accounted for in one of several Henry Ten Broeck households in New York State in <a href="../../census1790.html">1790</a>. He died in Claverack in 1796. He had filed a will in September 1776. It passed probate in Columbia County in 1796. We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> defining information on Anna's later life and passing.</p>
