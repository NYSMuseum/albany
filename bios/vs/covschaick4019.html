<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Cornelis Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in November 1736. He was the last child born to the marriage of Albany residents <a href="nvschaick3978.html">Nicholas</a> and <a href="../w/dowitbeck1720.html">Dorothea Witbeck</a> Van Schaick. He grew up in a small family in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> but lost both parents before he was fifteen.

<p>We <a href="../qqqq.html">seek</a> information on his adolescence and entry into adulthood. He has not been found in the city-based record until the late 1770s. 

<p>In 1767, a Cornelis was identified as a sergeant in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> company. Probably a differenct Cornelis Van Schaick (perhaps jr.) was a prominent Kinderhook resident <a href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/g/genpub/abp1949.0002.001/270?view=image&size=100">during</a> the War for Independence.

<p>During the 1780s and beyond, this individual <a href="../../res/ts.html">appears</a> to have been the city bellringer and the bellringer and sexton at the Albany Dutch church.

<p>In January 1784, at almost fifty, Cornelis married a much younger <a href="../h/wihansen4991.html">Willempie Hansen</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Two years later, the marriage produced a son who was named for Nicholas' deceased grandfather. In <a href="../../census1790.html#4019">1790</a>, "Cornelius Van Schaick's" second ward household included only their son. A decade later, his third ward <a href="../../census1800.html#4019">census </a>entry noted only Cornelis and Willempie as young Nicholas had died in October 1799. 

<p>Albany assessment rolls in <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#4019">1788</a>, and <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1799tl">1799</a> valued his various properties modestly. 

<p>Cornelis Van Schaick was dead by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=MJcMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA93&lpg=PA93&dq=%22willimpy&source=bl&ots=2hMsMVWy6z&sig=_-DavIKdJKAJGPvWz3HWqHbd1Rc&hl=en&ei=RM-nStiKJ5CEMf_16bEP&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10#v=onepage&q=%22willimpy&f=false">1813</a> when his widow was listed as the principal resident at 20 Steuben Street.</p>
