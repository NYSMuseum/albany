<p><a href="#sources"><b>Dirck Bradt Van Schoonhoven</b></a> was baptized in the Albany Dutch church 
              in February 1720. He was the second son of the seven children born 
              to Albany native Susanna Bradt and upriver landholder and one-time 
              Albany resident <a href="jgvschoon5896.html">Jacobus G. Van Schoonhoven</a>.</p>

            <p>By 1747, he had married <a href="../vd/vovdb5856.html">Volkie Vandenbergh</a> 
              - another Albany native. Their <a href="vschoonfm.html">ten children</a> 
              were baptized in the Albany Dutch Church between 1748 and 1767. 
              These Van Schoonhovens set up housekeeping in a modest dwelling 
              along upper Market Street near the northern <a href="../../citylimits.html">city 
              line</a>. Sometimes Dirck was called a resident of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
              or <a href="../../na/watervliet.html">Watervliet</a>. On other occasions, 
              he was identified as a citizen of Albany.</p>

 <p>Although he had practiced the carpenter's trade and was an aspiring landholder, by the 1750s, Dirck had established himself as <a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">skipper</a> of the sloop "Rising Sun" carrying cargoes between Albany and New York City. Over the next decades he was a well-known Hudson River slooper - hauling country produce downriver and returning with valuable cargoes on behalf of Albany merchants and <a href="../j/swj.html">Sir William Johnson</a> as well.</p>

<p>Like his father, Dirck B. Van Schoonhoven was prominent in the Albany County <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a>. In 1755, he was commissioned an ensign in the Rensselaerswyck company. He served the city government as well - being appointed <a href="../../firemasters.html">firemaster</a> for the Third Ward in 1750 - first documenting a long-term connection to the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">government</a> that culminated in his election as assistant alderman in 1766.</p>

<p>In 1766, he joined a number of Albany people in opposition to the Stamp Act by signing a "constitution" of the Albany <a href="../../solconst.html#5884">Sons of Liberty</a>. Ten years later, he was running errands for the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee of Safety</a> and was sent with a crew to serve as a carpenter at Ticonderoga. While not distinguished in any particular way, Dirck Bradt Van Schoonhoven was a well-known Albany personage during the 1770s and could be counted on to lend his <a href="#support">support</a> on behalf of friends and neighbors. After the war, he received a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service to the American cause.</p>

<p>Abandoning the river trade, he seems to have retired to his <a href="../../census1790.html#5884">Watervliet home</a> located just <a href="../../loc/northend.html">north</a> of the city line.. His only recorded public act of the post-war period seems to have been signing an anti-federal <a href="../../doc/1788aac.html#5884">petition</a> in April 1788. 

<p>Dirck Bradt Van Schoonhoven died in August 1795 at the age of seventy five and was buried from the Albany Dutch Church where he was a lifelong  member.</p>

              <A name=biography></a> The life of <B>Dirck Bradt Van Schoonhoven</B> 
              is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 5884. This profile 
              is derived chiefly from <a href="vschoon.html#sources">family</a> 
              and <a href="../../cbr.html">community-based resources</a>. His distinctive name (from his mother's <a href="../b/bradt.html">family</a>) makes him relatively easy to track. The difficulty in assigning 
              a firm place of residence probably stems from eighteenth-century 
              uncertainty regarding the "<a href="../../citylimits.html">line</a>" 
              between city and patroonship!</p>

<p><a name="support"></a><font size=-1>"Support" here means he signed a number of petitions on behalf of unfortunate neighbors, witnessed several wills, and also witnessed a number of marriage contacts or "bonds."</font></p>
