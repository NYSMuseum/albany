<P><a href="#sources"><b>Johannes Gerritse Van Schaick</b></a> was born in October 1748. He was the eldest surviving son of Albany businessman <a href="wevschaick3990.html">Wessel</a> and <a href="../g/magerr6009.html">Maria Gerritse</a> Van Schaick. His middle name commemorates his mother's <a href="../g/gerritse.html">family</a>.</p>


<p>In August 1775, he was almost twenty-seven when he married <a href="anvschaick3997.html">Anna Van Schaick</a>. By 1796, six of their children had been baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where he was a member who sometimes supplied wine for church services.</p>

<p>Raised in his father's <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market Street</a> store, his first ward house and property (probably on State Street) were valued substantially on the assessment roll in <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3963">1779</a>. By that time, he was raising a family and had served as a firemaster. Aside from contributing a barrel of flour in 1775, his name appears to be absent from the rolls of community-based <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">wartime</a> activities. However, he was <a href="http://www.cohoes.com/Cit-e-Access/webpage.cfm?TID=34&TPID=6434">reputed</a> to be a financier of the American army!</p> 

<p>In 1782, he was named as a contingent beneficiary in the <a href="../../wills/willwevschaick.html">will</a> of his father. However, that document also held him to a debt of almost a thousand pounds and set up conditions for its repayment. His bachelor younger brother and later business associate, <a href="gewvschaick3953.html">Gerrit W. Van Schaick</a>, may have lived with them for a time and later became a prominent Albany bank officer and property holder. In <a href="../../census1790.html#3963">1790</a>, this Albany merchant was the head of the first ward household. <a href="http://www.hmdb.org/Marker.asp?Marker=7250"><img src="../../images/jpg/vsmtablet.jpg" align=right border=0 width=200 alt="Van Schaick Mansion tablet"></a> 

<p>The Van Schaick brothers proved to be sharp businessmen as they were among the creditors who hounded <a href="../d/wmduer.html">William Duer</a> into debtor's prison in 1793. 

<p>Within a decade, he relocated to a home at 5 North Pearl Street while maintaining the <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">landmark</a> Market Street store.</p>  

<p>After 1813, he seems to have left the city. Johannes G. Van Schaick died on <a href="http://bcsd.k12.ny.us/middle/michalek/FrontPage%20Albany%202002A/Albanyhomes2004/van_schaick_mansion_.htm">Van Schaick Island</a> in 1828.</p>
