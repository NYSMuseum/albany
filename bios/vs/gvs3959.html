      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Goose Van Schaick</b></a> was born in February 
        1696. He was the son of <a href="antvschaick3934.html">Anthony</a> and 
        <a href="../vd/mavdp6263.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick. His father 
        was a businessman and landholder who had a large farm on the Hudson - 
        about ten miles north of Albany. Goose and his siblings grew up in both 
        city and farm environments.</p>
      <p>In September 1720, he married young <a href="../a/coabeel133.html">Neeltie 
        Abeel</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. She 
        died in November 1730 after bearing five children. Goose married another 
        Albany native <a href="devschaick4029.html">Debora Van Schaick</a> in 
        August 1734. That marriage produced only one child before his untimely 
        death.</p>
      <p>This Gosen (Goose) Van Schaick was a prominent Albany resident who was 
        known as a "<a href="../../art/art-rpea.html">sloopmaster</a>" and sloop 
        owner. He served the community as constable, high constable, assistant, 
        and was elected third ward <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> 
        in 1733. He served in the <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        and was a lieutenant in the Albany <a href="../../lists/list1715troop.html">troop</a>. 
<p>In September 1728, he became the second member of the Van Schaick family to be appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</A> of Albany city and county. He served until replaced in 1731.
 
<p>"Mindful of [his] mortality," Goose Van Schaick filed a <a href="../../wills/willgvs3959.html">will</a> in July 1736. He died a few days later and was buried in the church cemetery on July 29. He had lived but forty years. The will passed probate on October 4, 1736. His widow re-married and lived for several decades.</p>
