<P><A href="#biography"><B>Gerritje Van Schaick</B></A> was born in September 1687. She was the eldest daughter of Albany residents <a href="antvschaick3934.html">Anthony</a> and <a href="../vd/mavdp6263.html">Maria Vanderpoel</a> Van Schaick.  She grew up in a large family in the Albany homes of a wealthy businessman and landholder.</P>

          <P>Just past her seventeenth birthday, Gerritje married silversmith 
            <a href="../t/cote4812.html">Coenradt Ten Eyck</a> at her father's 
            Albany home on September 24, 1704. Seven months later, the first of 
            her ten children was baptized in the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
            church</a>.</P>

<p>These Ten Eycks lived in the <a href="../../wards.html">first ward</a> where Coenradt was a prominent silversmith, businessman, and city official. Over the next decades, their fortunes were bolstered by substantial <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">bequests</a> from Gerritje's family - the Van Schaicks. By the late 1740s, they had moved across State Street to a "good house" in the third ward.</p>

<p>Gerritje lost her husband early in 1753. She inherited the use of his property and was a well-known Albany <a href="../../census1756.html#147">householder</a> for the next decade. Eight of her children married and raised their own families in Albany and its hinterland. Her son, <a href="../t/jacte4881.html">Jacob</a>, became 
            mayor of Albany in 1748. Daughter <a href="../t/anmgte4836.html">Anna 
            Margarita</a> married future mayor John Barclay in 1771.

<p>In November 1756, widow Gerritje filed her <a href="../../wills/willgevschaick3755.html">will</a>. It named her seven living children as beneficiaries of her real and personal estate. The will passed probate in October 1768. Gerritje Van Schaick Ten Eyck had lived in Albany for close to eighty years. </p>
