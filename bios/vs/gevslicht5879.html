<strong>Gerrit Van Slichtenhorst</strong></a> was born in the Netherlands in 1627. He was the son of Brant Van Slichtenhorst - director of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> and Aeltje van Wenckum Van Slichtenhorst. He may have come to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> with his father in 1648.

<p>His father returned to Holland about 1660 and Gerrit seems to have represented Van Slichtenhorst family interests in America after that. In that year, he was <a href="../../lists/list1660.html#5879">counted</a> among the most prominent Beverwyck-based fur traders. In 1668, Gerrit also made a trip to the Netherlands to deal with his father's estate.

<p>In 1672, he married <a href="../l/allansing.html">Alida (Aeltie) Lansing</a>. At that time, he was identified as a <a href="../../na/schenectady.html">Schenectady</a> magistrate and/or commissary. The marriage produced at least five children.

<p>In <a href="../../census1679.html#5879">1679</a>, his name was included on a census of Albany householders. In addition to a number of Albany parcels, he also owned <a href="../../res/realestate.html">property</a> at Claverack.

<p>Gerrit Van Slichtenhorst filed a will and died in Kingston in January 1684. His <a href="mvslicht.html">sister</a> was the wife and widow of Philip Pieterse Schuyler. With Gerrit's passing, the Van Slichtenhorst family name dropped from Albany rolls.</p>
