<strong>Geurt Hendricks</strong></a> was the patriarch of the Albany <a href="vschoon.html">Van Schoonhoven</a> family.

<p>He emigrated to New Netherland and may have settled in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> as late as the 1650s. Supporting himself through carpentry, initially he rented a dwelling while working out of a "celler with a lean-to shed" - which he purchased in 1663. Later, he owned a house and lot within the Albany <a href="../../map/map1676.html">stockade</a>.
         
<p>He seems, however, to have preferred the countryside. By the mid-1670s, he was farming at "<a href="../../na/halfmoon.html">the Half Moon</a>" and later on Cohoes Island. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html">1689</a>, he was included on a list of subscribers consisting of farmers in <a href="#Marte">Marte Gerritse's company</a>. One of many contemporaries who held dual residences, the <a href="../../census1697.html#060">census of 1697</a> also lists him and his family as householders in the city of Albany.</p>

          <p>By the 1660s, he had married <a href="mcvschoon.html">Maria Cornelis</a>. 
            They were members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a> 
            where he was able to find carpentry work and also aid and assistance. 
            Their six <a href="vschoonfm.html">surviving children</a> (all born 
            prior to extant baptism records dating from 1683) became church members.</p>

<p><a name=will>In August 1700, an ailing Geurt Hendrickse made a <a href="#will">will</a> which summarized his life in America. Calling himself a <a href="#yeoman">yeoman</a> of Halfmoon, he acknowledged the suppremacy of God and also his allegiance to the king of England. He left his "well beloved wife Marite Cornelius" 
            his entire Halfmoon estate and also his lot in Albany. She was made 
            executrix. Eldest son <a href="jgvschoon5896.html">Jacob</a> was given 
            one pound and ten shillings as his birthright and son Hendrick was 
            left Geurt's carpenter tools. The sons were to share farm tools. After 
            their mother's death, the sons were to have the Halfmoon and Albany 
            property appraised, and, after six years, divide the proceeds six 
            ways to include their sisters, Margarita, Hendrickie, <a href="geervschoon5886.html">Geertruy</a>, and 
            Jacomyntie Van Schoonhoven.
			
<p>This New Netherland <a href="../../nnd.html">pioneer</a> died in January 1702.</p>

<a name=sources></a>The life of <B>Geurt Hendricks</B> is CAP <A href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 5887. This profile is derived chiefly from <a href="../../cbr.html">community</a> and <a href="vschoon.html#sources">family</a> based resources.
<dd><a NAME="The name"></a>The name "Geurt" seems to be unique to several generations of the <a href="vschoon.html">Van Schoonhoven</a> family - at least in the Albany context. We are told it is a Rhenen dialect form of Gerrit. For more on Geurt Hendrickse, see Andrew Brink, "The Van Schoonhovens: Enterprising Immigrants," 
            <a href="../../fhg.html#dhm"><i>De Halve Maen</i></a> 72:2 (Summer 1999), pp. 33-40.

<p><a name="Marte"></a><b>Gerritse's company</b> farmed <a href="../../na/castle.html">Castle 
            Island</a>, today's Port of Albany.</p>

          <p><a name="yeoman"></a><b>Yeoman</b> means independent (not tenant) and most 
            often land-owning (not a dependant) farmer. The Half Moon was located 
            north of <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> 
            and thus represented an opportunity to actually own land.
