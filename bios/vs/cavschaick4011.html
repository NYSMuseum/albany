<P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in January 1723. She was the daughter of Albany slooper and official <a href="gvs3959.html">Goose Van Schaick</a> and his first wife, <a href="../a/coabeel133.html">Neeltie Abeel</a> Van Schaick. One of five children, Catharina's mother died in 1730. Her father remarried in 1734.
	 
<p>In July 1736, she was  named in the <a href="../../wills/willgvs3959.html">will</a> filed by Goose Van Schaick. He died a few days later leaving a substantial estate to his widow and then his three living children. In January 1737, she was included among the eventual heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">will</a> filed by her grandfather.

<p>In October 1744, she was identified as a spinster when she married the somewhat older but childless widower <a href="../l/jolansing3744.html">John Jac. Lansing</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Their only child was christened in Albany in September 1745. However, young Goosen died shortly thereafter.

<p>Catharina Van Schaick Lansing appears to have died in childbirth as "Catalina, wife of Joh. Jacob Lansing," was buried from the church on September 1. Her husband married for the third time about 1747, fathered more children, and lived until 1797.</p>
