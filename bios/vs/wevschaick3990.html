      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Wessel Van Schaick</b></a> was born in February 
        1712. He was the son of businessman and landholder <a href="antvschaick3935.html">Anthony 
        Van Schaick</a> and his wife, <a href="../t/antbroeck8.html">Anna Catharina 
        Ten Broeck</a> Van Schaick. He grew up in a large family in a landmark 
        home on Albany's main street.</p>
      <p>In November 1743, he married Albany native <a href="../g/magerr6009.html">Maria 
        Gerritse</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where 
        he was a pewholder and baptism sponsor. The marriage produced five children 
        - four of whom lived to maturity.</p>
      <p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3990">1763</a>, his name appeared 
        on a list of Albany County freeholders. Known in the community as a <a href="../../census1756.html#255">blacksmith</a>, 
        Wessel or "Nessie" seems to have been more of a merchant whose Albany 
        holdings were among the most valuable by the mid 1760s. His preferred 
        <a href="#trade">trade items</a> were metalware which he also repaired 
        and customized. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3990">1779</a>, 
        his personal property was assessed substantially under his first ward 
        home.</p>
      <p>Although he had served in the county <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia</a> 
        in colonial times, he was in his sixties at the outbreak of the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> 
        and did not appear to play a role in the conflict except as a contributor 
        and contractor. However, in March 1776, he was one of a number of Albany 
        merchants <a href="../../coc.html">cited</a> for raising their prices.</p>
      <p>"Sick and weak in body," Albany businessman Wessel Van Schaick filed 
        a <a href="../../wills/willwevschaick.html">will</a> in December 1782. 
        It left his entire estate to Maria as long as she remained his widow. 
        Wessel died in 1783 in his seventieth year. His widow and <a href="gewvschaick3953.html">son</a> 
        lived in their first ward <a href="../../census1790.html#6009">home</a> 
        for many years.</p>
