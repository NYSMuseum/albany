<strong>Engeltie Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in 1659. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneers <a href="ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> and <a href="../l/anlievens.html">Anna Lievens</a> Van Schaick. 

<p>In 1668, she was named an heir in the <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">joint will</a> filed by her parents. At that time, she was said to have been nine years old. 


<p>By 1681, she had married <a href="../s/pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a>, the favored son of another prominent and emerging early Albany <a href="../s/schuyler.html">family</a>. By 1689, the marriage had produced four children who were christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members and regular baptism sponsors.

<p>This Schuyler family made their home on <a href="../../loc/court.html">Court Street</a> near where the <a href="../../loc/ruttenkill.html">Ruttenkill</a> flows into the river. Pieter Schuyler was named first mayor of Albany in 1686.

<p>However, their marriage was short-lived as Engeltie Van Schaick Schuyler died following the birth of her fourth child in 1689. She was barely thirty years old. Her husband re-married in 1691.</p>
