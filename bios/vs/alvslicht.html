<P><A href="#biography"><B>Alida Van Slichtenhorst</B></A> was born in what became Albany during the first half of the seventeenth century. We seek documentation regarding her origins She probably was not the daughter of <a href="gevslicht5879.html">Gerrit</a> and Aeltje (Alida) Lansing Van Slichtenhorst - if they indeed were married in 1672.</P>

<p>Her first husband was <a href="gevschaick3951.html">Gerrit Van Schaick</a>. Their marriage appears to have been childless. She was a principal in their <a href="../../wills/willgevschaick.html">joint will</a> filed in November 1679. By 1681, she was a widow who had married twenty-two-year-old <a href="../s/pischuyler1734.html">Pieter D. Schuyler</a>. That marriage produced seven or nine children before his untimely death in 1696.</p>

<p>The widow's household was described on the Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#005">census</a> in 1697 and on subsequent Albany <a href="../../lists/list1709tl.html"#5877>assessment rolls</a>.</p>
 
<P>Alida Van Slichtenhorst Van Schaick Schuyler lived another fifty-one years She died on December 25, 1748 at age eighty-eight.</P>

            <A name=biography>The life of Alida Van Slichtenhorst Van Schaick Schuyler is CAP <A 
      href="../../db.html">biography number</A> 5877. This profile is derived 
            chiefly from family and community-based resources. We are puzzled as to her origins unless she was a daughter of Rensselaerswyck director Brant Van Slichtenhorst. However, some genealogical sources insist she was the daughter of Gerrit and Alida Lansing Van Slichtenhorst. </p>
