<P>The <a href="#sources"><b>Van Schaick</b></a> family of early Albany is descended from <a href="ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> who came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> during the 1630s. He established himself in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">B</a>everwyck and Albany and was known as a trader, processor, and landholder. His descendants built on those successes in Albany and <a href="../../albanycounty.html">beyond</a>. The family name has many <a href="../../res/sp.html">var</a>iants. The Van Schaicks were numerous and prominent in and <a href="../../na/na.html">bey</a>ond the city of Albany. However, our <a href="../../criteria.html">focus</a> must remain with the city residents - an important minority part of the overall family presence.

<p>Goosen Gerritse's <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">numerous</a> American-born offspring established the family in Albany and beyond. His son, <a href="livschaick3965.html">Livinius</a>,  a multi-residence merchant, was elected to the Provincial Assembly first in 1691.

<p>In 1697, the household of <a href="antvschaick3934.html">Anthony Van Schaick, Sr.</a> was listed on the Albany <a href="../../census1697.html#102">census</a>. His daughter, <a href="gevschaick3755.html">Gerritje</a>, was the mother of future Albany mayor Jacob C. Ten Eyck.

<p>In 1719, <a href="gevschaick3952.html">Gerrit S. Van Schaick</a> was the first of three family members to be appointed <a href="../../sheriffs.html">sheriff</a> of Albany County. 

<p>Throughout the eighteenth century and beyond, the family maintained a substantial presence on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Schaick_Island">island</a> near the northern boundary of the <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Manor</a> at the confluence of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers that is today within the city of Cohoes. Over the long century, a number of Albany natives and residents enjoyed the Van Schaick property there. It was described in the <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">will</a> filed by Albany native <a href="antvschaick3934.html">Anthony Van Schaick</a> in 1737.  

<p><a href="sgvschaick.html">Sybrant G. Van Schaick</a> was named mayor of Albany in 1756. His was the most prominent of seven, Van Schaick-named households appearing on a <a href="../../census1756.html">census of Albany householders</a> taken in that year by the British army. The mayor's son, Colonel <a href="gvs.html">Goose Van Schaick</a>, was a field officer in the Revolutionary army.</p>

<p><a href="../../friends.html#left">Tory</a> brothers Peter and one-time Albany businessman <a href="hvschaack.html">Henry Van Schaack</a> were sons of a prominent <a href="../../na/khook.html">Kinderhook</a> branch but have not yet been definitively connected to the family of Gosen Gerritse.

<p>In 1815, three Van Schaick households were listed in the Albany <a href="../../sources.html#ad">city directory</a> including the home of Bank of Albany Cashier and realtor <a href="gewvschaick3953.html">Gerrit W. Van Schaick</a>. By that time, <a href="../../streets.html#vs">Van Schaick Street</a> was lined with boardinghouses.</p>
