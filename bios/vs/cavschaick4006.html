<P>As she was not named in the joint <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">will</a> filed by her parents in 1668, <a href="#sources"> <strong>Catharina Van Schaick</strong></a> probably was born about 1670. She was the daughter of pioneer and family patriarch <a href="ggvs3928.html">Goosen Gerritse</a> and his second wife, <a href="../l/anlievens.html">Anna Lievens</a> Van Schaick. 

<p>She grew up in a large combined family in homes in what became  Albany and at other regional family residences as well. Her father was dead by 1676 and her widowed mother was left to raise the family - relocating to New York City during the 1690s. In April 1702, she was among the offspring named and was identified as the wife of Matthew Clarkson in the <a href="../../wills/willanliev.html">will</a> filed by her mother. 

<p>In January 1692, Catharina had married <a href=http://books.google.com/books?id=iNIUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA1024&lpg=PA1024&dq=%22matthew+clarkson%22+van+schaick&source=bl&ots=XdqYABmsZf&sig=9MCcSKAUFGCnuVO4KO7KE7gipP0&hl=en&ei=4BiyS-fXIMKB8gaUyYGEAw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CBcQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=%22matthew%20clarkson%22%20van%20schaick&f=false"">Clarkson</a> - a prominent royal   official. They had five children before he died in New York in July 1702.

<p>In October 1702, she was identified as a deceased widow when she was named in the <a href="../../wills/willannvschaick.html">will</a> filed by her widowed sister.</p>
