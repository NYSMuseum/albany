<P><a href="#sources"><strong>Stephanus Van Schaick</strong></a> was born in February 1730. He was the son of <a href="nvschaick3978.html">Nicholas</a> and <a href="../w/dowitbeck1720.html">Dorothea Witbeck</a> Van Schaick. He was an older child in a first ward family whose development was curtailed by the death of his mother in 1740. Other same-named contemporaries complicate the assignment of qualitative information but this individual seems to be the only "<a href="../../res/sp.html">St</a>even" who lived in the city of Albany.
  
<p>In March 1753, Van Schaick married carpenter's daughter and Albany native <a href="../b/jabradt4247.html">Jannetje Bradt</a>. By 1770, five children had been christened at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> where both parents were members. As his father had died in 1750, Stephanus joined his father-in-law in the carpentry business.

<p>These Van Schaicks set up their home in Albany's <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> where Stephanus <a href="../../census1756.html#239">practiced</a> the carpenter's <a href="../../makers.html">trade</a>. Among his <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html#3981">customers</a> was the city of Albany. During the 1760s, he built the city hall wharf and was a regular contractor to the Albany <a href="../../corporation.html">corporation</a>. His substantial first ward <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3981">home</a> was <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#3981">configured</a> on several Albany <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">assessment</a> rolls.  <a href="../../census1790.html#3981">Census</a> records show that his household included one slave. In 1788, his adult sons were living with him and he also owned an <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#add3981">additional</a> house in the first ward.

<p>In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3981">1763</a>, his name was included on a list of Albany freeholders.

<p>During the 1760s and at least thru <a href="http://www.threerivershms.com/docnyhistservicemilitia1.htm">1773</a>, he served in an Albany <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>. In 1775, he was paid by the Albany <a href="../../coc.html">Committee</a> for repairing the barracks and supplying firewood. In May, he was identified as a lieutenant in the first ward <a href="../../albanymilitia.html">militia company</a>.

<p>In <a href="../../wills/willhebogert.html#3981">1788</a>, he owed a small sum to the estate of a former Court Street neighbor.

<p>In <a href="../../census1800.html#3981">1800</a>, his household consisted of two adolescent boys, the aging couple, and a slave.
 
<p>Stephanus Van Schaick died in May 1802 at the age of seventy-two.
