<P>This <a href="#sources"> <strong>Anthony Van Schaick,</strong></a> was born in May 1721. He was the eldest of the five children of <a href="gvs3959.html">Goose Van Schaick</a> and his first wife, <a href="../a/coabeel133.html">Debora Abeel</a> Van Schaick. His mother died in 1730 and his father later remarried. He was known as "Jr." and also as Anthony G. Van Schaick. However, a number of contemporaries also were identified similarly.

<p>In July 1736, he was among those named and provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willgvs3959.html">will</a> 
        filed by his father. Goose Van Schaick died the next year but his stepmother 
        survived for several decades. In January 1737, he was identified as "Anthony 
        G. Van Schaick" and named among the beneficiaries in the <a href="../../wills/willanvschaick.html">will</a> 
        filed by his grandfather. By virtue of that document, he eventually received 
        substantial property on the upper Hudson islands. That will passed probate 
        early in 1741. 
      <p>In September 1751, he married <a href="chvschaick3943.html">Christina Van Schaick</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. Perhaps the marriage produced only a son and   daughter.

<p>In March 1756, he witnessed the <a href="../../wills/willhanshansen.html">will</a> of a prominent Albany personage. In March 1763, he was named co-executor of the will <a href="../../wills/willanmgtvschaick.html">filed</a> by Anna Margarita Van Schaick - the maiden sister of his dead father.

<p>In October 1761, "Antony Van Schaick, Jr." was named co-executor of the <a href="../../wills/willanmgtvschaick.html">will</a> of his wife's maiden sister. In <a href="../../lists/list1763fl.html#3939">1763</a>, the name of Antony G. Van Schaick appeared on a list of Albany County freeholders.  In September, two "Anthony Van Schaicks" were listed in the <a href="../../wills/willcavschaick4007.html">will</a> filed by another kinswoman. This subject was one of those named. 

<p>These Van Schaicks appeared to have lived mostly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Schaick_Island">Van Schaick Island</a>. Qualitative material for "Anthony Van Schaick" documents substantial wealth but may not pertain to this subject. In <a href="../../lists/list1779tlm.html#3939">1779</a>, "Anthony Van Schaick" owned a substantial lot in Albany's third ward and at least nominally belonged to an Albany <a href="../../lists/listbr1racm.html#3939">militia company</a>. 

<p>Then aged sixty, in August 1781, Anthony Van Schaick "of the island of Cohoes" in Albany County filed his <a href="../../wills/willantvschaick3939.html">will</a>. It named his wife (Christina) and daughter as his heirs. He was dead by April 1782 when the will passed probate. His widow survived into the 1800s.</p>
