<strong>Anna Maria Van Schaick</strong></a> was born about 1670. She was the daughter of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> pioneer <a href="ggvs3928.html">Gosen Gerritse</a> and his second wife <a href="../l/anlievens.html">Anna Lievens</a> Van Schaick. Her father died while Anna was a young girl and her mother became matriarch of the Van Schaick family. Anna Maria grew up in a large combined family in homes in Albany and its hinterland. Her brothers and sisters would further establish the Van Schaick family in Albany and beyond.

<p>In Jun 1695, she married Johannes Van Cortlandt in the Dutch church in New York. The marriage produced only one child who was named for her father's <a href="../s/geerschuyler1726.html">mother</a> - a member of Albany's first family. The marriage also connected the Van Schaicks to perhaps the pre-eminent <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> family of New York City.

<p>Anna's husband was the eldest son and principal heir to the Van Cortlandt family fortune. Although blessed with substantial landholdings, they resided primarily in New York City. However, the marriage was of short duration as Johannes Van Cortlandt would lived for only about thirty years.

<p>In April 1702, Anna Maria was mentioned and her children provided for in the <a href="../../wills/willanliev.html">will</a> filed by her mother who then was living in New York City. At that point widow Anna Van Schaick could not know that Anna Maria would have only a daughter.

<p>By October 1706, Anna Van Cortlandt was a widow herself when she filed her <a href="../../wills/willannvschaick.html">will</a>. By that time, she seems to have returned to Albany where the will passed probate.

<p>Anna Maria Van Schaick Van Cortlandt died that same year.
