<strong>Cornelis Van Schelluyne</strong></a> was born in September 1737. He was the son of aging merchant and <a href="../../census1756.html#153">Albany</a> mainstay <a href="divschell6434.html">Dirck Van Schelluyne</a> and his second wife, <a href="../r/elroseboom1599.html">Elizabeth Roseboom</a> Van Schelluyne.

<p>In December 1767, he was thirty when he married Elizabeth Roseboom at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. By 1774, the marriage had produced four children. He was a church member, occasional baptism sponsor, pewholder, and member of the Consistory.

<p>Cornelis seems to have taken up family enterprises following the death of his father in 1759. Assessment rolls for the <a href="../../guide/histres.html#1766tl">1760s</a> show his property among the highest valued in the city and that his mother lived with him.

<p>Cornelis Van Schelluyne was a <a href="../../streets.html#pearl">Pearl Street</a> merchant and Albany <a href="../../census1790.html#5647">mainstay</a> for many years. His traditional home was valued on every <a href="../../lists/list1788tl.html#5647">assessment roll</a> during the last half of the eighteenth century. He owned additional <a href="../../res/realestate.html">real estate</a> in and around Albany. He served as constable, firemaster, election inspector, and militiaman. In 1770, he first was elected <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant alderman</a>.

<p>A prominent merchant and not cloosely tied to the crusade for American liberties, his business was <a href="../../cddc.html">scrutinized</a> during the <a href="../../or/or-3r.html">War</a> for Independence and he was required to sign oaths and associations. However, he later was accorded a <a href="../../or/or-fw.html">land bounty right</a> for service in conjunction with the Albany militia.

<p>In <a href="../../census1790.html#5647">1790</a>, his second ward household included twelve slaves - making him Albany's second largest <a href="../../afroalbanians.html">slaveholder</a>. That number dropped to six slaves counted in <a href="../../census1800.html#5647">1800</a>, down to three shown on the census in 1810. 

<p>Cornelis Van Schelluyne died in April 1813 and was buried from his church. His will passed probate later in the month.</p>
