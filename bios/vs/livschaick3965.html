      <P> <a href="#sources"> <strong>Livinius (Levinius) Van Schaick</strong></a> 
        was born about 1661. He was the son of <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> 
        pioneers <a href="ggvs3928.html">Gosen Gerritse</a> and his second wife, 
        <a href="../l/anlievens.html">Anna Lievens</a> Van Schaick. 
      <p>In 1668, he was named among the heirs in the <a href="../../wills/willggvs3928.html">will</a> 
        filed by his parents. At that time, he was seven years old. 
      <p>His <a href="#rvs">marriages</a> appear to have occurred after he left 
        Albany but, during the 1680s (and perhaps into the early 90s), he was 
        counted among the members of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch 
        church</a>. 
      <p>Coming of age during the early 1680s, young Livinius was an Albany merchant 
        and <a href="../../furtrade.html">trader</a>. In <a href="../../lists/list1689.html#1">1689</a>, 
        his name appeared on an assessment roll of Albany householders. 
      <p>In <a href="../../org/cc.html#1686">1686</a>, he was appointed <a href="../../corporation.html#offices">alderman</a> 
        under the Albany city <a href="../../charter.html">charter</a>. He served 
        as alderman and assessor for the <a href="../../wards.html#1">first ward</a> 
        through 1692. 
      <p>After that, he seems to have relocated to New York City perhaps to better 
        serve in the provincial <a href="../../org/ass.html">Assembly</a> where 
        he was elected first in 1691. However, shortly thereafter, he <a href="#rvs">appears</a> 
        to have returned to Europe where he married and raised a family. His marriage 
        to the widow Anna in February 1694 was short-lived and childless. In early 
        1695, he wed one Anna Groenwout in Amsterdam. At least eight children 
        were christened in Holland between 1695 and 1708. 
      <p>In 1702 [sic], he transferred his bible to a young <a href="../d/jodp.html#jdp">Johannes 
        De Peyster</a> of New York. At that time, Livinius Van Schaick was identified 
        as a merchant of Amsterdam. American -based <a href="../../res/ts.html">tr</a>aditional 
        sources also tell us that he had returned to Holland. In April of that 
        year, he also was <a href="../../wills/willanliev.html">named</a> heir 
        and co-executor of his mother's estate. In <a href="../../wills/willannvschaick.html">1706</a>, 
        he was in line to share share in the estate of his widowed sister. His 
        last child (named Levinius) was christened in December 1708. At that time, 
        he was living in Amsterdam. His widow buried a child in 1710. 
      <p>We seek more definitive information on his passing!</p>

        This <a href="../../res/bios.html">sketch</a> is derived chiefly from

        resources</a>. Until recently, we were able to present only the community-based 
        (Albany) side of his life. This Livinius Van Schaick is one of only a 
        few who were born in Albany to immigrant parents and who relocated to 
        the Netherlands to live out the balance of their lives.

          <a href="../../na/na.html">out-of-Albany</a> life (which makes the Albany 
          context much less puzzling), we are grateful for the very accessible
