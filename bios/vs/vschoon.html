          <p>The <a href="#sources">story</a> of the Van Schoonhoven family in Albany 
            begins with Holland born <a href="ghvschoon5887.html">Geurt Hendrickse</a>, 
            a carpenter, farmer, and Albany householder, who may have come to 
            America as early as 1638. Two or more brothers also may have emigrated 
            to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a>. Of the six surviving 
            children of the marriage of Geurt Hendrickse and <a href="mcvschoon.html">Maria 
            Cornelis</a>, three daughters and a son married and established the 
            second generation of the family in the colony of New York.</p>

          <p>The son, known as <a href="jgvschoon5896.html">Jacobus G. Van Schoonhoven</a>, 
            was listed next to his father on the <a href="../../census1697.html#060">Albany 
            census</a> in 1697. Middle aged, he married <a href="../b/susbradt1138.html">Susanna Bradt</a> in 1714. 
            He was a farmer and sawyer at Half Moon and Tomhannock. Their seven 
            children included two sons (Geurt and Dirck Bradt) who raised families 
            of their own.</p>

      <p>While his older brother worked the farm, <a href="dbvschoon5884.html">Dirck 
        Bradt Van Schoonhoven</a> became a prominent Hudson River skipper, a sometime 
        carpenter, and a well-known member of the Albany community. His marriage 
        to Volkie Vandenbergh produced ten children who spread out in the upper 
        Hudson region. Their son, Jacob, was a carpenter who lived on the section 
        of North Market Street that was annexed to the city in 1814.</p>

          <p>Here since the New Netherland period, the descendants of Geurt Hendrickse and 
            Maria Cornelis persisted in Albany well into the 19th century. We 
            have identified twenty-six <a href="vschoonfm.html">Van Schoonhoven 
            family members</a> who lived in the city prior to 1800.</p>

Barris's compilation entitled <i>Dutch Cousins: 784 Descendants of Geurt Hendrickse Van Schoonhoven of Albany and Half Moon, NY</i> (privately printed, 2001), which includes material from this website but goes far beyond Albany in tracking family members!
