      <P><a href="#sources"><b>Anna Van Schaick</b></a> was born in July 1754. 
        She was the daughter of <a href="antvschaick3939.html">Anthony G.</a> 
        and <a href="chvschaick3943.html">Christina Van Schaick</a>. She was the 
        lone daughter in the family of one of the proprietors of the Van Schaick 
        holdings in what is now the city of Cohoes.</p>
      <p>In August 1775, she married her cousin, Albany native <a href="jogvschaick3963.html">John 
        G. Van Schaick</a> at the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a>. 
        By 1795, the marriage had produced at least five children.</p>
      <p>These Van Schaicks lived at the family store on North <a href="../../loc/marketstreet.html">Market 
        Street</a> near State where they were <a href="../../census1790.html#3963">Albany 
        mainstays</a>. 
      <p>In 1781, she was named in the <a href="../../wills/willantvschaick3939.html">will</a> 
        filed by her father. Her father died the following April leaving Anna 
        and her mother to benefit from his substantial estate which included lands 
        in Cohoes and beyond. They soon sold those assets. 
      <p>In 1828, subsequent <a href="../../wills/willantvschaick3939.html#lit">litigation</a> 
        tells us that Anna Van Schaick died about 1816. Her husband is said to 
        have left Albany and to have died on Van Schaick Island in 1828.</p>
