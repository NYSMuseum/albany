<p><b>Margarita Van Slichtenhorst</b> was born at Nykerk in the Netherlands in 1628 -  the daughter of Brant Van Slichtenhorst and Aeltje Van Wenkum. She came to <a href="../../nnd.html">New Netherland</a> with her parents in 1647 and came of age in <a href="../../na/rensselaerswyck.html">Rensselaerswyck</a> where her father served as director of the colony.</p>

            <p>In December 1650, she married <a href="../s/phpischuyler.html">Philip Pieterse 
              Schuyler</a> - an immigrant carpenter who, following the marriage, 
              became one of the leading traders of Beverwyck/Albany. The marriage 
              produced twelve children between 1652 and 1672. Eight of those offspring 
              went on to establish the <a href="../s/schuyler.html">Schuyler family</a> in Albany and beyond.</p>

            <p>By the 1660s, these Schuylers were established in a <a href="../../loc/schuylerhouse.html">new 
              house</a> on upper State Street. Before his death in 1683, Philip 
              Pieterse had stretched the Schuyler family holdings by acquiring 
              property around Albany and beyond.</p>

            <p>A widow at age 55, by virtue of their joint <a href="../../wills/willphpischuyler.html">will</a> filed in 1683, 
              Margarita Schuyler assumed control of her husband's extensive estate. 
              From her Albany house and at the farm known as <a href="../../na/schuylerflats.html">"the 
              Flats,"</a> Margarita continued her husband's business and sat as 
              the matriarch of early Albany's foremost family. Her children included 
              <a href="../s/pischuyler61.html">Pieter Schuyler</a> - first mayor 
              of the city; Alida, the wife of Robert Livingston; and future mayor 
              - Johannes Schuyler. Her other offspring established themselves 
              in favored locations throughout the region.</p>

Margarita Van Slichenhorst Schuyler lived until 1711. For much of that time, she was one of colonial Albany's most <a href="../../census1697.html">prominent residents</a>. This active widow participated in business, landholding, and was an active member of the<a href="../../drc.html">Dutch Church</a>. Surrounded by family and supported by a number of slaves, this able women's life was full and advantaged.<p></p>

<p>Her <a href="../../wills/willmgtvslicht.html">will</a>, filed in 1707, identified her as a "sometime...Albany merchant" and mentioned the real and personal estate she had acquired since the death of her husband. This seventy-nine-year-old widow had the presence of mind to circumvent English inheritance laws when she divided the Schuyler estate equally among her eight surviving children and their heirs. She died at age eighty-two on January 11, 1711.</p>
