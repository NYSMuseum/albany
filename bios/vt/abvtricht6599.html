<P><a href="#sources"><b>Abraham Van Tricht</b></a> probably was in <a href="../../beverwyck.html">Beverwyck</a> at the time of the English takeover. In legal documents, he was identified as a "<a href="../../trades/medical.html">churgeon</a>" and seems to have acted as a coroner in addition to treating patients in a variety of ways!</p>


<p>His wife was <a href="../t/elteller6602.html">Elizabeth Teller</a> with whom he had several children. He was a member of the Albany <a href="../../drc.html">Dutch church</a> and an occasional baptism sponsor. In 1675, he also was a deacon at the New York Reformed Church.</p>


<p>Van Tricht's Albany home was located on the hill of what became the <a href="../../wards.html#2">second ward</a>. That house and lot was sold to <a href="../vp/isvplanck1127.html">Isaac Verplanck</a> in 1678. His new home was listed on a census of householders taken in <a href="../../census1679.html#6599">1679</a> and was referenced in subsequent real estate transactions. In 1686, Van Tricht was one of the first <a href="../../corporation.html">assistant aldermen</a> appointed under Albany's new municipal <a href="../../charter.html">charter</a>.</p> 

<p>The rise of Abraham Van Tricht was cut short by his death in October 1687. He was buried from the Albany Dutch church. Elizabeth re-married in 1692. Without sons, the Van Tricht name passed from Albany rolls following his death. </p>

He probably was the brother of trader Gerrit Van Tricht, <a href="../../sources.html#era"><i>ERA</i></a>, vol. 3, p. 95n. We seek defining information on his origins!</p>
